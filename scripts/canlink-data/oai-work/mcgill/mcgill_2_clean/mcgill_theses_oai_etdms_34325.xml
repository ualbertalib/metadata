Recent experiments revealed that expiratory NO production rises during exercise and correlates well with O$ sb2$ consumption and heart rate. Whether or not physical conditioning influences expiratory NO output production remains unclear. In this study, NO concentration in expired gas was measured in 18 healthy male volunteers subdivided into 3 groups (sedentary, intermediate, athletes) based on their state of physical conditioning. Measurements were taken at rest and during two steady-state exercise bouts on a bicycle ergometer designed to elicit VO$ sb2$ of 1 and 2 1/min with the athletes performing an additional bout at VO$ sb2$ of 4 1/min. In the sedentary and intermediate groups, expired NO concentrations declined significantly with increasing VO$ sb2.$ In contrast, expired NO levels declined only slightly with increasing VO$ sb2$ in athletes. At a VO$ sb2$ of 2 1/min, expired NO concentrations were significantly higher in athletes compared with the other groups. When correlated with V$ rm sb{E},$ expired NO concentrations declined linearly with the increase in $ rm V sb{E}$ in sedentary and intermediate groups but not in the athletes. Only the athletes had a significant linear increase in NO output (expired NO x V$ rm sb{E})$ with increasing VO$ sb2$ (p $&lt;$ 0.001). These results support the notion that physical conditioning increases expiratory NO output during exercise. We speculate that the rise in expiratory NO output in athletes might be due to increased vascular and/or epithelial production of NO. Enhanced vascular NO production may be the result of increased shear stress and/or upregulation of endothelial NO synthase gene expression.</description><creator>Maroun, Martin J.</creator><contributor>Turcotte, Rene (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Physical fitness</subject><subject>Nitric oxide</subject><subject>Exercise -- Physiological aspects</subject><title>Physical conditioning and nitric oxide production during exercise</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t148fj83q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n009w410f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physical Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pn89d8322</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:44:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>According to Metheny (1965), people's impressions of the acceptability of sport for women varies across several factors, including culture and gender. In this study, 206 prospective physical education teachers from Canada and Kenya were questioned about their perceptions of gender appropriateness of various sports. They completed Likert-type questionnaires related to sport/physical activities found in their respective university curricula. For those sports that appeared in both countries, responses were compared (2 x 2 ANOVA) for effects of culture and gender. Gender differences were also addressed within each culture. Results revealed that Canadian respondents perceived fewer sports to be on the extremes of the male-female continuum than did the Kenyan respondents. Females in both cultures considered more sports to be appropriate for both male and female participation than did their male counterparts. However, Canadian and Kenyan respondents, both male and female, unanimously perceived some sports to be primarily appropriate for males and others primarily appropriate for females. The study supports Metheny's contention of cultural variance in perceptions of the gender appropriateness of sports. Although many sports that had been considered inappropriate for females in 1964 are today considered to be androgynous, especially by Canadians, some gender stereotyping still remains to be overcome. Implications for physical education teachers are suggested.</description><creator>Oluko Olembo, David</creator><contributor>Downey, M. J.

However, little research has specifically investigated the complete range of discipline techniques used by teachers to prevent misbehavior and to regulate it after its occurrence. This study described the discipline techniques used by secondary physical education teachers and compared them to Henkel's (1991) Physical Education Pupil Inventory (PEPCI) developed for elementary teachers. Eight high school physical educators were observed for four lessons each and were interviewed following the observations. Discipline techniques observed and presented in interviews were analyzed by deduction into Henkel's PEPCI categories. The techniques that did not fit into Henkel's categories were inductively analyzed to identify any new categories emerging from the observation or interview data. The results revealed that secondary physical education teachers used a repertoire of 32 discipline techniques including 21 techniques from Henkel's (1991) PEPCI. The only PEPCI technique that was not employed by secondary teachers was "physically reprimanding". The discipline techniques were divided into three major classifications: anticipatory, tutoring, and punitive (Henkel, 1991).</description><creator>Perron, Josée</creator><contributor>Downey, Margaret (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>School discipline -- Québec (Province)</subject><subject>Physical education and training -- Study and teaching (Secondary) -- Québec (Province)</subject><title>Discipline techniques used by secondary physical education teachers</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5t34sm18t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jh343t86h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physical Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:d791sj01h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:44:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study investigated the within-group differences in ice-time and experience with the team in task cohesion perceptions of college hockey players and their relationship with team performance success. One hundred and seventy-one male hockey players between the age of seventeen and twenty-two years, representing ten teams, answered the two task portions of the Group Environment Questionnaire, as well as a question concerning their feelings regarding the amount of ice-time received during games. The data was analysed using a 3 x 2 ANOVA for success by ice-time and success by experience with the team for each of the two measures of task cohesion. The results showed the more successful teams to be most cohesive, but significant (p $&lt;$.05) within-group differences were only found among the veterans and rookies of the least successful teams. It was concluded that within-group differences in cohesion exist in teams of low levels of success, but that highly and moderately successful teams do not experience the phenomenon.

At present predisposing factors remain unknown and effective therapies are not available for many of these diseases. However, recent work has described at least 4 pathogenic mechanisms. (1) Oxidative stress: mutations in the superoxide dismutase gene cause approximately 1% of ALS cases. (2) Neurofilament abnormalities: neurofilament overexpression causes an ALS-like phenotype in mice, while pathologically, neurofilament accumulation is observed in patients. (3) Deregulation of apoptosis: deletions in apoptosis-regulatory genes are present in spinal muscular atrophy. (4) Expansion of trinucleotide repeats---expansions are responsible for many neurodegenerative diseases including fragile X and Huntington's disease. My work involved the investigation of these mechanisms in the pathogenesis of ALS and Parkinson's disease. Identification of molecular defects in genes regulating these pathways would provide direct evidence linking these mechanisms to neurodegeneration. Such evidence was not found. Mutations in the Mn SOD and catalase genes were absent in both disease populations. The Cu/Zn SOD gene was not mutated in Parkinson's patients. A novel allele at the NEFH KSP repeat locus was identified in Guam and Kii ALS patients but its presence in non-affected Guam and Japanese individuals eliminated it as a causative mutation. The same allele, absent in non-Asian Pacific populations, was identified in 7 affected individuals of an atypical Puerto Rican Parkinson-dystonia family. Further studies are necessary to determine whether the disease in this family is associated with this locus. Results from the study of the SMA- and SBMA-causing mutations in ALS, revealed the presence of diagnostic errors within the ALS population. While not unexpected, the significant differences in prognosis between SMA or SBMA and ALS, make this differentiation important. Caucasian SBMA was found to be due to new mutations and not predisposing or founder chromosomes as reported in Japanese SBMA and other trinucleotide repeat diseases. While the etiology of neurodegenerative disease is complex, my work has led to a significant increase in our understanding of this complex group of disorders. Much additional work needs to be done so that accurate diagnoses can be made and targeted effective treatments developed.</description><creator>Parboosingh, Jillian S.</creator><contributor>Rouleau, G.

The localization of the initiation sites and the identification of the corresponding sequences and/or structures is important to understand the process of initiation at the molecular level. The objective of the research in this thesis is to localize the initiation site of DNA synthesis at a specific locus on the chromosomes of mammalian cells, and to characterize the minimal sequence requirements for the function of this origin of DNA replication in vivo. A genomic clone was isolated using ors12, a mammalian autonomously replicating sequence (812 bp) that was previously isolated by extrusion of African Green monkey (CV-1 cells) nascent DNA from active replication bubbles. Ors12 associates with the nuclear matrix in a cell cycle dependent manner, and is present at the centromeric region of six CV-1 cell chromosomes and that of a marker chromosome. This genomic clone was used to generate PCR primers in a region encompassing ors12, in order to amplify nascent DNA strands isolated from asynchronously growing CV-1 and African Green monkey primary kidney cells. A competitive PCR-based mapping methodology was used, and revealed that DNA replication initiates preferentially in vivo in a region colocalizing with ors12, providing evidence of its function as a bona fide chromosomal origin of DNA replication. In an attempt to define the sequence or structural elements that are important for mammalian origin function, a panel of deletion mutants of ors12 (812-bp) was generated. The deletion mutants were tested for their replication activity in vivo by the bromodeoxyuridine substitution assay, after transfection into HeLa cells, and in vitro by the DpnI resistance assay, using extracts from HeLa cells. A 215-bp internal fragment was identified as essential for the autonomous replication activity of ors12. When subcloned into the vector pML2 and similarly tested, this subfragment was capable of autonomous replication in vivo and in vitro. Several repeated sequence motifs are present in this 215-bp fragment, such as TGGG(A) and G(A)AG (repeated four times each); TTTC, AGG, and MA (repeated 3 times each); the motifs CACACA and CTCTCT, and two imperfect inverted repeats, 22-bp and 16-bp long, respectively.</description><creator>Pelletier, Richard.</creator><contributor>Zannis-Hadjopoulos, Maria (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Biology, Genetics.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Functional genomic mapping of a centromeric mammalian origin of DNA replication and identification of its minimal functional sequence</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ws859h361.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q811km41d</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qv33rz39z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:44:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis, changes in the regulation of the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1) were used as markers to study altered gene expression in the conceptus after oxidative stress. Both experimental and clinical studies implicate oxidative stress in embryo malformation. In the conceptus, the tripeptide, glutathione, protects against oxidative stress. It exists in oxidised (GSSG) and reduced (GSH) forms, and the GSSG:GSH ratio is an important measure of oxidative stress. At the initiation of rat whole embryo culture we noted a transient increase in the GSSG:GSH ratio. This was associated with an increased AP-1 DNA binding activity and increased expression of fos and jun mRNAs; Fos and Jun are the dimeric constituents of AP-1. Addition of antioxidant enzymes to the culture medium preserved the GSSG:GSH ratio and prevented AP-1 induction, indicating that AP-1 is stimulated by oxidative stress. The oxidative stress of culture also promoted the induction of endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities in the conceptus. The cysteine pro-drug, 2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate (OTC), increased cellular GSH content in the embryo affording it protection from oxidative stress; however, OTC had no such effect in the yolk sac. The tissue-specific protection of OTC against oxidative stress was reflected in: (1) the inhibition. of the culture-induced rise in AP-1 binding only in the embryo, and (2) the prevention of culture-induced increases of certain antioxidant enzyme activities that may be regulated by AP-1. The induction of AP-1 binding was independent of the Fos or Jun phosphorylation state; however, immunodepletion of Ref-1, a protein which controls AP-1 binding by site specific reductions of Fos and Jun abolished binding activity. Thus, the AP-1 oxidative stress response is tissue-specific, and may be controlled by redox-coupled reductions of the AP-1 complex. In a different paradigm, the GSH content of the conceptus was depleted with the GSH biosynthetic inhibito</description><creator>Ozolins, Terence Robert Stanislavs.</creator><contributor>Hales, B. F.

Parent-offspring conflict occurs in domestic pigs: piglets of Confined sows suckled more and ate less solid food but grew at the same rate as piglets from Get-away sows, indicating they obtained more milk. Confined sows lost more weight than Get-away sows and returned to oestrus later, indicating a fitness cost of providing the additional milk. Parent-offspring conflict increased with piglet age: as the fitter aged, Get-away sows spent more time away from their young and the differences between Get-away sows and Confined sows in weight loss and nursing frequency increased. In Get-away sows, the reduction in contact with their young occurred rapidly, but its timing varied greatly among individual sows. Behavioural conflict over access to the udder is a plausible mechanism by which conflict is expressed in swine: piglets from Confined pens spent more time nuzzling the udder than piglets of Get-away sows. Piglets from Get-away sows nuzzled the udder a higher proportion of the time when the sow was present than piglets from Confined sows. Get-away sows terminated more nursings than Confined sows thus limiting the amount of contact piglets had with the udder after nursing. Mowing sows to control maternal provisioning improved productivity: there was a slight benefit of reduced time to the next oestrus for Get-away sows. Piglets from Get-away sows gained more weight and consumed more food after weaning than piglets from Confined sows. There was only slight evidence that get-away pens reduced behavioural indicators of post-weaning stress (e.g., movements, vocalizations, response to playback of vocalizations) for either the pi</description><creator>Pajor, Edmond A.</creator><contributor>Kramer, Donald L.

This study found that most PQ militants were francophone males under 40 years of age, with college degrees. They worked at jobs which would make them part of the intelligentsia, and along with some students, worked in francophone contexts. They often came from political homes, especially "nationalist" ones, and some militants felt hostility towards "les anglais". Most were actively involved in previous voluntary associations, especially activist organizations. They were recruited young and had prior attitudinal affinity. Most were self-recruited, while the others were recruited through family and friend networks. Their principal motive for joining was a set of ideological beliefs about Quebec independence, and they experienced no pressure to become a member. Most future militants, began by giving some casual labour to the PQ and then were invited to participate in more responsible positions. While a few militants stayed as "casual labour", the rest became "cadre" who worked part-time benevolently or "careerists" who received full-time jobs and salaries. The casual labour and cadre militants worked irregular hours, and had distinct preferences for and against certain types of political tasks. Most militants joined to further Quebec independence but intraparty conflict pitted youthful Johnsonists against older orthodox militants in 1987 and 1988. Among those militants who quit, most led busy, well-adjusted lives after the PQ, which were directed towards personal goals such as jobs or further education. The data pointed out that the PQ militants were motivated to join by grievances such as the minorization of French-Canadians within Canada, fears about the French language and culture in Quebec, discontent with federalism, and to a lesser extent, status inequality and economic domination by anglophones. These grievances and aspirations for greater political autonomy for Quebec were the principal internal motives. The collective incentive of independence and the supporting beliefs that it would bring political autonomy, international prestige and cultural protection were the most important determinants of whether or not a militant would join the PQ. Many militants spoke of the selective incentives gained through militancy, especially the social, educational and political benefits. Altruism existed in small doses, but by-and-large, people volunteered their time to the PQ because it benefitted them. Finally, expectancy of success was a necessary factor for militant motivations. The 1980 referendum defeat appeared to be the cause of the factionalism which dominated the phase of demobilization in the Parti Quebecois from 1980 to the Fall of 1988. The motives for staying or leaving after years of commitment were similar to and different from the motives for joining. The most important factor affecting a militant's decision to leave was the collective incentive. If the party's overall goal changed, many militants quit. Some militants of the losing faction stayed attached to the party due to social ties, paid positions, and the lack of viable alternative parties. Those militants who had some weaker ethnic group grievances, who believed less in the benefits of independence for Quebec, who enjoyed less certain organizational incentives, and were more pessimistic about the chances of success for their political party and social movement were more likely to be demobilized.

Who should be a school's principal? The purpose of this study was twofold. First to investigate executive succession within large, urban Canadian schools boards, and second, to use a dramatic work---a play---to represent the major findings. Theatre is used to present society and its workings, it is a method of data representation that permits human emotion, care, conflict and tension to become palpable, to provoke an audience. The two purposes of this study merged to provide insight unto the "reality" of school principals' promotions from the perspective of practitioners. Data on promotion was collected from thirteen seasoned school administrators through extended interviews. Respondents were encouraged to relate stories of individual promotions, as they understood them. The data was transcribed and analyzed using the constant comparison approach. This method yielded multiple levels of analysis including areas of reference, spheres of infra-influcnce (highly related concepts), and rules of inclusion (subsuming large amounts of data). It was clear that promotion was a "political act" where several stakeholders fought for their interests. Then followed transcendence---the movement from the naturalistically collected and analyzed data to the play---the movement from science to art form. The rules of inclusion inspired the foundations of the novella, the novella led to the play; characters, scenes and actions were developed. A group of actors rehearsed and prepared a staged reading. Tim play was presented to a group of educators who were asked to respond to it at two levels---the work as a provocation device for preparing educational administrators and the work as the "reality" of promotion. Clearly, the theatrical work stimulated the audience and indicated there is a valid place in administrator preparation programs for dramatic works. As well, the notion of promotion as "seeking the best possible candidate" was challenged as stakeholders' Interests dictated both promotion procedures and candidate succession.

In block ionomers, cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanoparticle sizes are found to scale with the ionic block length (N B) as NB3/5. CdS-polymer composites from block ionomers can be suspended in organic solvents as reverse micelles. Micelle stability is improved by reneutralization of acrylic acid blocks surrounding the nanoparticle. Reloading of microreactors and controlled continued growth of nanoparticles is demonstrated. Novel assemblies of CdS-containing reverse micelles are formed by secondary self-assembly in aqueous media. Scaling relations are also determined for microreactors containing different metal ions. For all metal ions investigated, the ionic core size scales as NB0.58+/-0.03, in agreement with starlike models; the proportionality constant is found to depend on the metal ion. Coronal structure in block ionomers has been investigated by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), using deuterated labels at various distances from the ionic core. Near the outside of the polymer brush, the scattered intensity scales with the scattering vector (q) as q --5/3, suggesting a semidilute environment for the label. Chain conformations are influenced by neighbouring coronae above the micelle overlap concentration. Closer to the ionic core, the chains become more crowded, and the semidilute assumption is not applicable. For labels directly connected to the core, intensity scaling suggests highly extended chains.</description><creator>Moffitt, Matthew.</creator><contributor>Eisenberg, Adi (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Chemistry, Polymer.</subject><subject>Chemistry, Physical.</subject><title>Nanoparticle size control and coronal structure in block ionomer micelles</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h989r488z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mk61rj892</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:c534fq63f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:44:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The efficient syntheses of substituted oxopiperazines from naturally occurring amino acids have been achieved. These may serve as conformationally constrained peptide mimics. In the first approach, N-prenylated amino acids were condensed with acid fluorides to give dipeptide analogues which upon ozonolysis, reductive work-up and hydrogenation gave cyclic dipeptides. A cyclized aspartame analogue 77 was prepared using this methodology.* The second approach used a sequence opposite to the first approach and therefore provided oxopiperazines 92 and 93 substituted with a hydroxyl group at the C-6 position. This group may serve as a handle to further functionalize the oxopiperazine ring.* The third approach was based on the cyclization of sulfonamide dipeptides with dibromoethane as the 1,2-dielectrophile.* Preliminary studies on solid phase have been carried out and this may open up the synthesis of a library of such constrained dipeptides. Cyclized tripeptide analogue 156 was prepared on a 2-chlorotrityl resin solid support.* *Please refer to dissertation for diagrams.</description><creator>Mohamed, Nazim.</creator><contributor>Just, George (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Chemistry, Organic.</subject><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Synthesis of derivatized oxopiperazines from amino acids</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8336h3544.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fq63f</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8p58pf69b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:44:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Can states formally recognize cultural diversity and, at the same time, preserve their political and social unity and provide the main public goods of modern citizenship? Is such conciliation feasible? Is it morally desirable? In the current context of unprecedented expression and politicization of cultural identities, especially in democratic countries, such questions are more and more crucial. To answer these questions, the present study considers the contribution of the modern federal tradition. Within this tradition, I analyze four federal responses to the unity-diversity dilemma. The first two---the Belgian and Canadian federations---are practical. Each embodies one of the two dominant contemporary models of federalism: classical liberal individualist, and multinational. I study the experience of each country over the past thirty years to compare the effects of the two models on citizenship. The potential of the modern federal tradition is further assessed through an examination of two theoretical and normative reflections, those of Tocqueville and Proudhon. The central thesis is twofold. First, I contend that in a context of increasing cultural diversity, unity and diversity have an equal value and are both essential to citizenship. This is true both from a moral and from a practical point of view. Second, I argue that the dominant conceptions of federalism are unable to satisfactorily conciliate unity and diversity. Such task requires the development of what I call an intercultural federalism, one centered on the good of identity pluralization or complexitication. From a strictly practical point of view, only an intercultural federalism can prevent identity fragmentation and the political and social fragmentation which come with it. From a moral perspective, intercultural federalism promises not only to protect, but also to maximize the primary goods which are the most affected by identity fragmentation---political liberty and social solidarity---while also promoting individual liberty. Intercultural federalism rests on three principles which summarize the teachings of the modern federal tradition with regard to the establishment of just citizenship institutions in a context of diversity. Such institutions are just in that they protect and maximize the primary goods of citizenship for all citizens. The three principles are: (1) mutual recognition; (2) intercultural dialogue; (3) multi-varied asymmetrical institutionalization.</description><creator>Karmis, Dimitrios.</creator><contributor>Tully, James (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Citizenship.</subject><subject>Federal government.</subject><subject>Federal government -- Canada.</subject><subject>Federal government -- Belgium.</subject><subject>Proudhon, P.-J.

In the first study, the chromosomal locations of the NPT1 and NPT2 genes in human and rabbit are determined by physical mapping techniques. The NPT1 and NPT2 genes map respectively to human chromosomes 6p22 and 5q35 and to rabbit chromosomes 12p11 and 3p11. The localization of the two cotransporter genes to autosomes excludes them as candidate genes for X-linked hypophosphatemia. In addition, these assignments agree with the previously reported homology between rabbit chromosome 12 and human chromosome 6 and provide the basis for the establishment of a conserved syntenic group between rabbit chromosome 3 and human chromosome 5. The goal of the second study was to clone, sequence and characterize the structure of the human NPT2 gene in order to design intronic primers to amplify NPT2 exons from patient DNA. Parallel experiments were performed on the mouse Npt2 gene, so that a vector could be designed to knockout the mouse Npt2 gene. In both species, the type II renal Na+-Pi cotransporter gene is approximately 16kb in length and is comprised of 13 exons and 12 introns. This work provides a basis for the study of the regulation of NPT2 transcription and facilitates the screening of DNA samples from patients with autosomally inherited disorders of renal Pi reabsorption for mutations in the NPT2 gene. In the third study, polymorphic markers flanking the NPT1 and NPT2 genes were typed in members of a Bedouin kindred segregating the autosomal disorder Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercaloiuria (HHRH). Genotype data were examined for excess homozygosity and allele sharing among affected pedigree members. Data did not reveal excess allele sharing on either chromosome 6 or 5, where the NPT1 and NPT2 genes are located, but suggested chromosome 3p as a site for further investigation. Identification of a HHRH locus is the first step toward identifying a gene involved in the pathophysiology of this disorder.</description><creator>Kos, Claudine H.</creator><contributor>Tenenhouse, H.

The experimental determination of the stress-strain behaviour of paper included documenting the effect of initial temperature and moisture content as well as process parameters, and was expressed as the in-nip calendering equation. The rheological behaviour of commercial newsprint made from thermomechanical pulp was found to be a strong nonlinear function of temperature and moisture content over the wide range of 20 to 80°C and 1 to 14% moisture. A simplified model for the transient local deformation of a calender roll in response to a local cross-machine (CD) control action was determined and validated against the previous complete numerical analysis solution for a variety of roll designs and thermal boundary conditions. This model, appropriate for use in real-time control, was shown to be effective in seeking a compromise between the conflicting CD control objectives of large roll deformation, fine CD resolution and fast control response time. From the above two elements a dynamic model of the calendering process was developed by appropriate combination of the model of transient local calender roll deformation with the in-nip calendering equation used to estimate, at a specific CD position, in-nip strain from permanent strain. Use of the model shows that paper response to a control action is highly sensitive to local nip load and to temperature and moisture content of the paper. After validation with published measurements on an industrial calender, the effectiveness of this model for minimizing thickness nonuniformity in the CD dimension through implementation of model predictive control of calendering was demonstrated. For a multi-roll calender stack of industrial specifications this demonstration showed an impressive reduction in CD control response time through use of multi-step control action. This model opens the prospect of a significant industrial innovation through the introduction of model predictive control to the difficult problem of CD control of calendering.</description><creator>Kawka, Dariusz Wlodzimierz.</creator><contributor>Douglas, W.

Starting from the Demosthenic corpus, the investigation goes beyond the question at issue in any particular speech in order to note some of the permanent principles which governed the politics of the orator and determined his choices. It deals particularly with Demosthenes' position on certain ideas, such as interest, power, alliances, reputation and law, his choice of war or of peace, and the importance which the orator gives to chance and opportunity. After a contextual examination of these ideas, the thesis suggests the existence of an ensemble of principles the foundation of which was the interest of the city; in view of the instability of the times, this interest required an extent of power which only alliances could ensure. To achieve them, a city needed to cultivate its image, since it had no ability to impose alliances. As for chance, it is suggested that, without being a fatalist, Demosthenes took serious account of it.</description><creator>Konstadatos, Spiridon.</creator><contributor>Silverthorne, M. J.

Over two years, captive kestrels were used to determine whether EMFs affect their plasma melatonin concentrations and their reproductive success. EMFs were equivalent to that which wild kestrels are exposed to while nesting under 735 kV transmission fines, and daily exposure used in the captive study (88--98% time budget) was potentially equivalent to that of wild kestrels (90% X, 80% X). Captive kestrels were housed in control or EMF conditions to determine short-term (one season; S-EMF) and longer-term EMF (two seasons; L-EMF) effects. Plasma melatonin in adult EMF males was suppressed at 42 d and elevated at 70 d of EMF exposure compared to controls. Melatonin levels in EMF males at mid-season were similar to controls at season's end, suggesting a seasonal phase-shift. Melatonin was suppressed in L-EMF fledgling birds but not in adult females or nudes (1995) at 70 d. Plasm melatonin, higher in adult males than females at 70 d post-pairing, was not directly associated with body mass changes in kestrels. Captive EMF birds were more active and alert but groomed less often than controls. EMF exposure affected reproductive success of kestrels. Fertility and fledging success were higher, and hatching success lower in S-EMF clutches. Hatching success was higher, but fledging success lower in L-EMF clutches. In S-EMF clutches, mean egg volume and mass were greater, eggs had slightly more albumen but thinner eggshells, and embryos were larger than controls. L-EMF hatchlings were heavier than controls. The melatonin results for male kestrels indicate that kestrels perceive EMFs as light, thus altering their photoperiod. Photoperiodic manipulations advance molt onset, which is associated with increased body mass in male kestrels. S-EMF males were heavier at 56 d of exposure when molt began, but this was unlikely related to feed intake winch was unchanged. EMF exposure had no effect on body mass and pectoral muscle scores of reproducing females. The sexually-dimorphic response in body mass and melatonin concentrations suggests that male kestrels may be more sensitive to EMF exposure than females.</description><creator>Fernie, Kimberly J.</creator><contributor>Bird, David M.

As such, preventing low back pain in adolescence may have a positive impact in adulthood. The objectives of this study were to determine the incidence of low back pain in a cohort of adolescents and to ascertain whether it was associated with increased growth spurt, decreased muscle flexibility and trunk strength, physical activity, and work. A prospective cohort design with urban high school students was conducted in Montreal, Canada; 502 students were evaluated at three separate times, six months apart. The students completed a questionnaire which addressed health issues of a musculoskeletal nature as well as lifestyle and psychosocial variables. They were also measured for: height, weight, leg and back flexibility, and trunk strength. Questions on low back pain referred to the previous six months and a frequency of occurrence of at least once a week was considered to represent positive reporting. Cumulative incidence of low back pain was then defined as the sum of incident reporting in the two six-month periods, excluding those who reported low back pain at study entry. A multivariate analysis (general estimating equations analysis) was used to model the repeated measures dichotomous outcome as a function of age, gender, smoking status and the repeated measures exposure variables: increased growth, flexibility, strength, activity, work. Of the 377 adolescents who did not complain of low back pain at the initial evaluation, 65 developed substantial back pain over the course of the year (cumulative incidence 17%). Risk factors associated with development of low back pain were: high growth (relative risk 3.00, 95% confidence interval (C.I.) 1.47--6.11), smoking (relative risk 2.47, C.I. 1.31--4.66), working (relative risk 2.19, C.I. 1.12--4.28), and tight quadriceps femoris (relative risk 1.04, C.I. 1.01--1.07).

The vast majority are closed and no longer accept wastes, but they still pose potential risks to the environment and nearby communities. For the past several years, state and provincial governments have proposed new "state-of-the-art" facilities as a way to allow industries continued access to waste disposal capacity, but with far stricter controls than most older sites have provided. Publicity of contamination incidents at existing waste sites, and also the institution of formal administrative reviews and public hearings for the location of new ones, have complicated the facility siting process considerably and led to the not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) syndrome. Additionally, issues related to environmental equity and justice often arise, especially in cases where local residents are racial minorities or low-income (social equity). The problem also has a spatial dimension when one region is expected to receive wastes from, and for the benefit of, industries in other areas (spatial equity), or when a heavily industrialized community becomes slated for yet another facility (cumulative equity). Cross-boundary and local autonomy issues heighten the controversies as well. This thesis reviews ten hazardous waste siting disputes in communities on the Canada-U.S. border in terms of their environmental justice implications. In the majority of cases, opponents of new hazardous waste facilities based their concerns on spatial equity and a variety of procedural matters. Racial minority groups tended to base their arguments on cumulative equity rather than social equity. In some cases, local and regional disputes became international matters given the geographic setting along the Canada-U.S. border.</description><creator>Fletcher, Thomas Hobbs.</creator><contributor>Ewing, Gordon (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Hazardous waste sites -- Canada.</subject><subject>Environmental justice -- United States.</subject><subject>Hazardous waste sites -- United States.</subject><subject>Environmental justice -- Canada.</subject><title>Environmental justice and hazardous waste : a view from the Canada-United States border</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pk02cc629.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v405sc002</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:c534fq64q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:44:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Following injury in the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS), there is no spontaneous regeneration. This differs from the adult peripheral nervous system (PNS) where axons are capable of long distance regeneration. It is known that the cytoskeletal response to injury in the CNS and PNS differs dramatically, and that the CNS response can be altered by modifying the environment of the injured axon. We have examined changes in cytoskeletal gene expression in the CNS following injury, during regeneration, and following the application of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the adult rat visual system where replacement of the injured optic nerve with a peripheral nerve graft results in the long distance regrowth of some retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). By following expression levels for GAP-43 and the tubulin isotypes, we have determined that the abortive regenerative response of injured RGCs may be partially ascribed to the lack of upregulation of growth associated proteins. However, peripheral nerve grafts were able to upregulate a full complement of growth associated gene expression in regenerating RGCs. BDNF upregulated the expression of some, but not all growth associated proteins when applied concurrently with axotomy. To promote the regrowth of injured CNS neurons on native CNS substrates, we have identified Rho as an intracellular target of inhibitory proteins in myelin. The Rho family of GTPases have been identified as regulators of the actin cytoskeleton which undergoes rearrangements during growth cone collapse events in response to inhibitory molecules. We have used the bacterial toxin C3, and pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells transfected with dominant negative Rho, to demonstrate that the inactivation of Rho in PC12 cells and primary neurons results in neurite outgrowth on inhibitory substrates.</description><creator>Fournier, Alyson.</creator><contributor>McKerracher, Lisa (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>Regulation of the cytoskeleton in mammalian CNS injury and regeneration</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h415pc191.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fq64q</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:44558f96h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:44:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>There are two main components to the research: the theoretical and the experimental. Chapter 2 contains an analysis of the state of soil quality guidelines and the scientific methods used to determine them. A number of recommendations to improve soil quality criteria for trace metals are offered including the importance of considering bioavailability and the need to use realistic conditions, trace metal sources and organisms. A critical review of the literature dealing with predicting the availability of trace metals to plants is presented in Chapter 3. We found little agreement among hundreds of similar studies which relate plant metal uptake to the amount of metal extracted by selective chemical dissolution procedures. An extensive summary of the data shows clearly that the extraction methods are not widely applicable. Differences between individual soils, their metal retention capacities, as well as plant factors and environmental conditions contribute to the variability of the results. Alternative ways of assessing bioavailability are suggested. The experimental component of the thesis focuses on the availability of trace metals to plants. In Chapter 4 the uptake of Cu from different soil pools was examined and the free metal ion (Cu2+) was found to be the best predictor of uptake by lettuce (Latuca sativa cv. Buttercrunch), ryegrass (Lolium perenne cv. Barmultra) and radish (Raphanus sativus cv. Cherry Belle). In Chapters 5 and 6 we examined the effect of low-cost in-situ treatments on the availability of metals to plants in greenhouse and field experiments. Synthetic zeolites, P amendments, organic matter and clean soil were used and their effect on the bioavailability of Cd, Cu, Pb, Ni and Zn evaluated. The plants for the experimental work were lettuce and perennial ryegrass. Only the clean soil treatment was consistently effective in reducing the concentration of metals in the plant. We also wanted to determine whether the trace metals in the plant tissue came from the soil or from direct deposition of pollutants on the leaf surfaces. We found little evidence that metals in plants were a result of atmospheric fallout. A method for the accurate analysis of total metal concentrations in a range of contaminated soils including those containing oil and grease was developed (Chapter 7). For this research the trace metals of concern are Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn---all commonly found in urban/industrial soils. The proposed method using HNO3/HClO4 has several advantages over the common HNO3/H2O2 procedure. We were able to digest larger soil samples and hence the final concentration of trace metals was usually in the range for analysis by inductively coupled plasma atomic absorption spectrometry or flame atomic absorption spectrometry.</description><creator>Cook, Nicola.</creator><contributor>Hendershot, W.

Some aspects of how pH influences metal retention and how the pH is changed by interactions between the sediment components and the metals, are considered. Initial metal concentrations ranged from 0.24 mmol/L to 22 mmol/L. The proportion of solid material to solution for sediments containing kaolinite was 0.1, and for the sediments without kaolinite was 0.001 or 0.002. It was found that the principal mechanism of metal retention by mackinawite was through lattice exchange, particularly over the lower range of metal concentrations. Up to 33% of the Fe in the mackinawite was replaced by Cd and Pb. Surface adsorption of Cd and Pb was of secondary importance, increased with initial metal concentration, and eventually became constant. After lattice exchange was complete the surface adsorption of Cd and Pb by the mackinawite reached maximum values of 1.90 mmol/g and 0.91 mmol/g respectively. Pb and Cd may have been forming soluble sulfide complexes as no hydroxide precipitation of Pb and Cd was apparent. At high initial metal concentrations, HA seemed to encourage the growth of three-dimensional Pb and Cd species. This precipitation occurred at pH 2.6 for Pb and at pH 3.9 for Cd, although these pH values are lower than is commonly expected for precipitation of these metals. In addition, the formation of soluble Cd humate species was noticed at pH 2.8. Finally, determination of the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of airdried and undried samples of HA resulted in values of 436 meq/100 g and 806 meq/100 g respectively. For kaolinite and HA, adsorption of Pb was generally greater than adsorption of Cd. The Pb appeared to be strongly attracted to the face and edge sites of kaolinite, while the Cd was only strongly attracted to the edge sites of kaolinite. Retention of Pb and Cd by HA was approximately 100 times greater than retention by kaolinite. The maximum retention of Pb and Cd by mackinawite was 4 times greater than by HA, except that mackinawite released Fe into solution in place of some of the Cd and Pb that was taken up. The pH of a kaolinite suspension was lowered 0.9 of a pH unit by the addition of 1% HA and was raised by 2.3 pH units upon the addition of 0.7% mackinawite. It was also shown that the pHzpc of HA was below pH 0.5, indicating a very negatively charged material.</description><creator>Coles, Cynthia A.</creator><contributor>Yong, R. N.

The aim of this study was to survey the egg parasitoids attacking the carrot weevil in carrot fields in Ontario, and elucidate the seasonal and chemical ecology of these natural enemies. Field surveys were conducted during three years in commercial carrot fields in the Holland Marsh and district marshes to detect the presence of carrot weevil egg parasitoids, to determine their geographical distribution and to evaluate the effect of insecticides on the rate of emergence and the activity of parasitoid adults. Two egg parasitoids, Anaphes listronoti Huber and A. victus Huber were found. The dominant species Anaphes listronoti is gregarious, was recovered from most of the sampled fields and was distributed in all sampled marshes whereas the solitary parasitoid A. victus was only sporadically found in the Holland Marsh. These Anaphes species occurred in carrot fields from the end of April to the beginning of September and seasonal parasitism averaged 33% in commercial carrot fields and up to 79% in an untreated plot. The insecticides phosmet, diazinon and cypermethrin used in carrot production, did not affect emergence rate of parasitoid adults indicating that immature stages are protected against insecticide penetration in the host egg. However, insecticide applications decreased parasitism rates and suggest a lethal effect on parasitoid adults by direct contact and insecticide residues, although no difference was observed between treatments. Laboratory studies were performed to determine the existence of a sexual pheromone produced by female A. listronoti using a four-arm olfactometer. An automated system of insect tracking was developed to quantify male behavior in the olfactometer. The response of males to odor emitted by virgin females less than two days of age was measured. Virgin females less than one-day-old released a long-range pheromone from 4 hours until 16 hours after the onset of the photophase. Females of one and two days of age started to emit the sexual pheromone earlier than younger females.</description><creator>Cormier, Daniel.</creator><date>1998</date><subject>Carrots -- Diseases and pests -- Biological control.</subject><subject>Mymaridae.</subject><subject>Carrot weevil -- Biological control.</subject><title>Seasonal and chemical ecology of Anaphes listronoti and A. victus (Hymenoptera:Mymaridae), egg parasitoids of the carrot weevil, Listronotus oregonensis (Coleoptera:Curculionidae), in central Ontario</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z316q3256.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9019s4195</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:707959440</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:45:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis involves a comprehensive review of the personality, psychiatric, and genetic risk factors for alcoholism and drug abuse. Based on this review, it is hypothesised that specific risk factors cluster together to represent separate vulnerability pathways to substance abuse and that differential susceptibility to the pharmacological effects of drugs of abuse (reinforcement and intoxication) mediates the relationship between such risk characteristics and drug-taking behaviour. A series of four studies are presented indicating that groups of individuals characterized by different risk factors for alcoholism are differentially sensitive to the reinforcing properties of alcohol. Non-alcoholic young adult men presumed to be at genetic risk for alcoholism (due to high genetic loading for alcoholism) were shown to be sensitive to the effects of alcohol on resting and stress-induced physiological states hypothesized to reflect activity within a brain reward system involved in the activation of approach and avoidance behaviour. Non-alcoholic young adult males self-reporting a personality profile that has been associated with increased risk for the development of panic disorder also demonstrated idiosyncratic responses to alcohol intoxication in that they appeared particularly sensitive to the. fear-dampening effects of alcohol. Finally, a group of non-alcoholic males were identified as being particularly susceptible to elevated and problematic alcohol and drug use in early adulthood due to a disinhibited/antisocial personality profile. These findings were interpreted as reflecting separate vulnerability pathways to substance use/abuse in which differential sensitivity to drug reinforcement and disinhibited personality are thought to play an important role in determining liability to seek out behavioural reinforcement from drugs of abuse. A second set of studies tested whether these factors are implicated in the maintenance of problematic alcohol and drug consumptio</description><creator>Conrod, Patricia J.</creator><contributor>Pihl, Robert O.

Solid-state proton spin-lattice relaxation times (T1H) allowed the determination of the molecular mobilities of carbohydrates and lignin as a function of PH for black spruce softwood. Similar measurements on isolated cellulose and cuoxam lignin were also conducted. These studies showed that the mobilities of the polymeric constituents of wood are affected by ionization processes occurring on the various functional groups present in lignin and cellulose. Quantitative 31P NMR Spectroscopy was also used to derive the fundamental thermodynamic parameters that are involved in the stereoselective degradation of the two diastereomeric forms of the most abundant structural (arylglycerol-beta-aryl ether) units of lignin under kraft pulping conditions. It was shown that the erythro isomers of the arylglycerol-beta-aryl ether units in softwood milled wood lignin cleave faster than their threo counterparts. The general stability of the threo diastereomers toward kraft pulping seems to be the manifestation of a considerably slower reaction of the pulping reagents with the threo diastereomers of arylglycerol-beta-aryl ethers. Quantitative 31P NMR Was also used for the identification and quantification of accumulated condensed diphenyimethane (DPW moieties during conventional kraft, extended modified continuous cooking (EMCCRTM) and soda pulping processes. A novel method that permits the quantitative detection and classification of various carbonyls in lignin was also developed. The proposed selective fluoride-induced trifluoromethylation method was optimized for a series of carbonyl-containing lignin-like model compounds. This was followed by 19F NMR spectral analyses of the resulting fluorine derivatives allowing for thorough understanding of their structure/19F NMR chemical shift relationships' our studies demonstrated that the Proposed method is a new analytical tool for the classification and quantification of various carbonyl groups that may be present in soluble lignins.</description><creator>Ahvazi, Behzad C.</creator><contributor>Argyropoulos, D.
