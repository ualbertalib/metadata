Raw milk samples containing indigenous microflora of approximately 106 CFU/mL were heat sealed in dual peel sterilization pouches and subjected to HP treatment from 150--400 MPa with holding times ranging 5--120 min. The kinetic parameters (rate constant, k and decimal reduction time, D) for the microorganisms, alkaline phosphatase, color and viscosity were evaluated, based on first order kinetics and the pressure dependence of kinetic parameters was evaluated using pressure destruction time (PDT) and Arrhenius models. Kinetic data was well described by the first order model (R 2 &gt; 0.90). The application of pressure pulse was explored for pressure destruction of microorganisms as well as changes in physical-chemical characteristics of pork chops. Pork chops (2 days post-rigor) were subjected to HP treatment from 200--350 MPa for 0--120 min. Results showed that pressure changes of pork variables followed a dual effect consisting of an instantaneous pressure kill (IPK) with the application of pressure pulse (no holding) and a subsequent first order rate of destruction during the pressure hold time. The IPK values were pressure dependent and increased with pressure level. Parameters k and D indicated a higher rate of pressure destruction of microorganisms compared to quality attributes. Kinetics of pressure destruction of Listeria monocytogenes Scott A were studied in relation to those of indigenous microorganism of milk and pork. The IPK was more pronounced with L. monocytogenes than with indigenous microflora. However, the kinetic parameters (k and D values) indicated a larger pressure resistance for L. monoctyogenes. HP processes were developed based on the standard plate count (SPC) kinetic data for indigenous microflora of milk as well as L. monocytogenes in milk and pork. The results showed that SPC kinetics permitted good estimation of microbial destruction in low pressure-lethality processes of milk and pork but its application at higher pressure-lethality levels were inaccurate. On the other hand, processes established based an destruction of L. monocytogenes were more predictable. Pressure pulse application to microbial lethality was also well predicted. The shelf-life of milk and pork increased with the level of applied pressure lethality, but Q10 values suggested that low storage temperature was nevertheless required to control microbial growth and maintain quality. Storage of HP treated park offered some improvement in the texture but resulted in large color changes and drip losses. L. monocytogenes were not detected in any of the stored milk samples HP treated to achieve a lethality ≥10D.</description><creator>Mussa, Dinna Mathemi.</creator><contributor>Ramaswamy, H. S.

The viral protein Tax, is essential for HTLV-I gene transactivation and responsible for oncogenic transformation. Tax is capable of indirectly transactivating numerous growth regulatory genes through interactions with host transcription factors. One of the targets of the Tax protein is the NF-kappaB/IkappaB family of transcriptional regulators. In HTLV-I Tax expressing cells, the maintenance of NF-kappaB activity is essential for cellular transformation. Previous studies demonstrated that Tax activated NF-kappaB through binding to the Rel homology domain of NF-kappaB. The objective of this work was to elucidate the mechanism by which Tax transactivates NF-kappaB. We addressed the specificity and function of Tax interaction with members of the NF-kappaB/IkappaBalpha family and demonstrated that: (1) Tax increased IkappaBalpha degradation, resulting in the induction of NF-kappaB DNA binding activity; (2) Tax enhanced NF-kappaB binding to DNA 40 to 100 fold by increasing NF-kappaB dimer formation which was detected in the absence of DNA; (3) Tax interacted with all NF-kappaB DNA binding subunits and with IkappaBalpha in vitro; (4) Tax physically associated with IkappaBalpha in vivo; and (5) Tax and IkappaBalpha had antagonistic effects on NF-kappaB binding and gene activity. These results suggested that Tax interaction with IkappaBalpha interferes with the formation of NF-kappaB-IkappaBalpha complexes and may play a role in targeting IkappaBalpha for degradation. To further characterize the interactions between Tax and IkappaB, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed that identified a complex in HTLV-I infected cells comprising Tax-IkappaBalpha and the HsN3 subunit of the 26S proteasome. Metabolic labeling and protein turnover studies indicate that Tax targets IkappaBalpha to the proteasome for degradation in a</description><creator>Petropoulos, Louisa.</creator><contributor>Hiscott, John (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Biology, Microbiology.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Molecular analysis of HTLV-1 tax interactions with the NF-kB and IkBa transcription factors</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t722hb47b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/41687k04r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:tm70mx14t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:37:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We propose a model based on a Ginzburg-Landau approach to study a strain relief mechanism at a free interface of a non-hydrostatically stressed solid, commonly observed in thin-film growth. The evolving instability, known as the Grinfeld instability, is of high technological importance. It can be associated with the dislocation-free island-on-layer growth mode in epitaxy which is an essential process used in the semiconductor industry. In our model, the elastic field is coupled to a scalar order parameter in such a way that the solid supports shear whereas the liquid phase does not. Thus, the order parameter has a transparent meaning in the context of liquid-solid phase transitions. We show that our model reduces in the appropriate limits to the sharp-interface equation, which is the traditional formulation of the problem. Inherent in our description is the proper treatment of non-linearities which avoids the numerical deficiencies of previous approaches and allows numerical studies in two and three dimensions. To test our model, we perform a numerical linear stability analysis and obtain a dispersion relation which agrees with analytical results. We study the non-linear regime by measuring the Fourier transform of the height-height correlation function. We observe that, as strain is relieved, interfacial structures, corresponding to different wave numbers, coarsen. Furthermore, we find that the structure factor shows scale invariance. We expect that our result on transient coarsening phenomena can be measured through microscopy or x-ray diffraction.</description><creator>Müller, Judith.</creator><contributor>Grant, Martin (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Physics, Condensed Matter.</subject><title>Study of stress-induced morphological instabilities</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6108vd226.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tm70mx14t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cv43nz92q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:37:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This doctoral thesis ("Signs of Danger/Dangerous Signs: Responding to Nuclear Threat") is a poststructural, interdisciplinary exploration of the social, political and cultural workings of nuclear threat. Drawing extensively on a nuclear waste burial initiative being undertaken by the United States Department of Energy, this work is a detailed critical analysis of the relationships between the threats posed by nuclear wastes, and the responses provoked in relation to such threats. Working through such theorists as Jacques Lacan and Slavoj Zˆizˆek (the second death, and le Reel), Francois Ewald (thresholds), Ulrich Beck (risk society), and Felix Guattari (ecology of the virtual), this work demonstrates the manner in which ecological threats, such as that posed by the nuclear, are (paradoxically) "creative" forces; that is, they have a propensity to cut through traditional social divisions (e.g., class, race), assembling news lines of affinity, and new constituencies of those at risk. Indeed, it seem that nuclear threat constitutes a novel form of threat. A form of threat that is irreducibly material, yet admits of no objective ground upon which decisions may be made. A form of threat that threatens the very biological foundations of life, yet whose ontology is to be determined through social and cultural responses. The principle critical figure I use to analyse and illustrate the movement of threat is the vast monument/sign which is to be constructed above the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in the desert near Carlsbad, New Mexico. If constructed, this monument will be one of the largest public works project in history. The purpose of this monument is to signify the danger which is to be buried below and thereby deter---for a legislated period of 10,000 years---inadvertent human intrusion into the site. Through analyses of the semiotic issues raised by the desert monument, the appropriation of the practice of burial and its relations to cultural conceptions of death, and the use of the desert as the mise-en-scene of waste, this dissertation shows how the larger context of waste burial demonstrates an extreme and unexamined field of cultural trauma and disavowal around issues of nuclear threat.</description><creator>Van Wyck, Peter C.</creator><contributor>Straw, W.

Each of them were found to display an AB quartet in the 1H NMR spectrum, suggesting the possible existence of the isomeric thionosulfite structure (RO)2S=S in contrast to the more commonly proposed linear structure R-O-S-S-O-R. This structure question was addressed by preparing a series of closely related compounds including the analogous disulfide R2S2, tetrasulfide R2S4, "oxytrisulfide" R-O-S3-R, sulfoxylate R-O-S-O-R, sulfite (RO)2S=O, cyclic thionosulfite and corresponding cyclic sulfite, followed by comparative 1H and 13C NMR studies. The solid state structure was established to be linear according to X-ray analysis with somewhat short S-S bond length compared with conventional disulfide structures. The possible interconversion between the linear and the branched isomer was ruled out following an extensive spectroscopic study including 17O NMR, IR, Raman and UV.</description><description>The solid/solution structure was established to be linear with a rigid gauche conformation dependent of a barrier to rotation of ca. 18 kcal mol-1 (Tc = 75°C). This barrier was responsible for the diastereotopicity of the adjacent benzylic protons, giving rise to asymmetric induction, and permitted the detection of the enantiomers with the chiral shift reagent Eu(hfc)3 in chloroform at room temperature. The existence of rotational diastereomers was demonstrated by 1H and 13C NMR for chiral dialkoxy disulfides prepared from enantiomerically pure chiral and racemic alcohols.</description><description>Triphenylphosphine desulfurization of dialkoxy disulfides yielded the corresponding sulfoxylates. The kinetics of the conversion of these to the corresponding sulfinates RO(S=O)R were examined and found to be first order; the Arrhenius parameters were determined.</description><description>A temperature dependent NMR study revealed that dibenzyloxy disulfides can deliver singlet diatomic sulfur S2. The thermolysis was studied in different solvents in the presence of different dienes. The disulfide adduct and the diene were comparably competitive for the S2 transfer. Tetrasulfide adducts were obtained in the presence of dimethyl and diphenyl butadiene, but converted to the disulfide adduct upon triphenylphosphine treatment. The related "oxytrisulfide" was demonstrated to also transfer the S2 unit to dienes. A brief analysis of a known thionosulfite has shown its potential to transfer S2 units to dienes. Mechanistic considerations were proposed to rationalize the olefinic compounds formed.</description><creator>Tardiff, Sylvie L.</creator><contributor>Harpp, D. N.

Machines that operate autonomously will always be faced with this dilemma, and can only be successful if they play a much more active role. This paper presents such a machine. It deliberately seeks out those parts of the world which maximize the fidelity of its internal representations, and keeps searching until those representations are acceptable. This paradigm is called visual autonomous exploration, and the machine an autonomous explorer. There are three major contributions in this thesis. The first is a theory of how to explore, or more precisely a framework for active inference. With it one can produce an engineering design that has the advantages of modularity, yet at the same time contains the computational methods needed to navigate the sensor to the best data. The navigational component can be implemented as feedback around classic "bottom-up" inference. It can be retro-fitted to existing passive systems and confer on them all the advantages of activity. The second contribution is a set of mechanisms that provide a layer of task supervision and control over the navigational loop, and that ensure robust operation when the world does not meet the assumptions of the theory. Without these mechanisms the system operates reflectively. With them it becomes adaptable and exploratory. The final contribution is a working implementation that can actively infer superellipsoid descriptions of articulated multi-part objects. The system is entirely bottom-up and does not depend on any a priori knowledge of the environment. To my knowledge it is the first to have successfully closed the loop between gaze planning and the inference of complex 3D models.</description><creator>Whaite, Peter.</creator><contributor>Ferrie, F.

In the first part the Weyl orbit-orbit branching rules are calculated for all classical simple Lie algebra - maximal regular reductive subalgebra pairs: Cm+n⊃Cm⊕C n, Dm+n⊃Dm⊕D n, Bm+n⊃Dm⊕B n, Am+n+1⊃Am⊕An⊕ u1, Bm+1⊃Bm⊕u1 , Cm+1⊃Am⊕u1 , Dm+1⊃Dm⊕u1 , Dm+1⊃Am⊕u1 . The branching rules are given in terms of integrity bases and compatibility rules. In the second part we use results from the first part to derive the complete branching rules (i.e. representation-representation branching rules) for the algebra subalgebra series son ⊃son-2 ⊕u1. The branching rules are given in terms of generating functions. The third part is in character similar to the first part---the Weyl orbit-orbit branching rules are computed for affine algebra-subalgebra, pairs obtained from the pairs listed above by affinization. The rules are presented in terms of integrity bases and compatibility rules.</description><creator>Thoma, Martin.</creator><contributor>Sharp, R. T.

The sample consisted of one hundred-and-one elite soccer players at professional, university, and under 15 year levels. A Soccer Behavior, Beliefs, and Preferences Questionnaire, developed by the investigator, and the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 (Martens et al., 1990) were used to assess respectively soccer superstitions and pre-game anxiety. Pearson Correlations, ANOVAs, and t-tests were computed to test the study's hypotheses. A significant relationship was not found between superstition endorsement and pre-game anxiety for the group sampled. Superstitious practices were found to be significantly negatively related to age (r = -.23), teenagers being significantly higher in superstition scores than both professional and varsity groups (H(2,98) = 6.72, p &lt; .05). Although superstition endorsement was not different between the genders at the same levels of play, both under 15 boys and girls were more superstitious than university women. Professional players exhibited significantly more state self-confidence than the teenage group (t(66) = 2.03, p &lt; .05). The under 15 boys were significantly more cognitively anxious than the professional athletes (T(45) = -2.52, p &lt; .05). At these levels of play, superstitious behavior was not in general related in males or females to pre-game anxiety.</description><creator>Mounicot, Marc.</creator><contributor>Neil, G. I.

Data were collected on 130 couples two months after the husband's MI. Couples were categorized into four groups based on their scores on a psychological distress measure, the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Husbands and wives completed the demographic questionnaire, the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS), the Social Support Questionnaire (SSQ6), and the three subscales (domestic adjustment. sexual relationship, social adjustment) of the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale (PAIS). In addition, husbands completed the Cardiac Symptoms List (CSL) and wives completed the Caregiving Involvement Questionnaire (CIQ). Data were analyzed using One-Way Multivariate Analysis of Variance with four groups followed by Tukey's Post Hoc Test. Relevant extraneous variables (cardiac symptoms, number of prescribed medications, social support satisfaction of the husband and the wife) were controlled using One-Way Multivariate Analysis of Covariance.

Participants were 30 young adolescents from grade 6 to grade 11 from the McGill Summer "Explorations" Program for the gifted, 75 undergraduate students and 46 doctoral students from various departments of McGill University. The Affect Intensity Measure was administrated to all three groups. There were no affect-intensity differences among the three groups of participants. Affect Intensity Measures particularly failed to distinguish gifted and nongifted groups. This result was inconsistent with previous studies using Overexcitability Questionnaire. There were gender differences but no age differences in affect intensity. The gender differences result was also inconsistent with the findings in several earlier studies using Overexcitability Questionnaire in which no gender differences in overexcitability were found among the gifted.

Results show that parental criticisms have only an indirect effect on young adults' reaction to criticisms: the effect is mediated by individuals' perception of how frequently they are criticized. The models with mothers' and fathers' EOI explain a significant proportion of variance in young adults' reaction to EOI however, parental EO1 has neither a direct nor indirect effect on young adults' reaction to EOI.</description><creator>Barve, Chinmayee.</creator><contributor>King, Suzanne (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Psychology, Clinical.</subject><subject>Psychology, Social.</subject><title>Individual factors as buffers against parental expressed emotion : a path-analytical model</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2v23vv95f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8c97ks182</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychiatry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:79407z94j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:37:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study is an inquiry into cultural conflict experienced by adolescents of Vietnamese origin in Montreal. It examines the nature of the conflicts as they are experienced by the adolescents themselves, as they are perceived by the parents, and by the teachers, counsellors and principals at the secondary schools they attended. The study also examines the course of the conflicts and the kinds of solutions used to resolve them. Separate semi-structured interviews were conducted with six adolescents, five parents and seven school personnel in two public schools attended by the students. Analysis of the interviews showed that students, parents and school personnel tended to define the problems in different ways and to have very different perceptions of their causes. In those families in which the problems of cultural conflict manifested themselves most severely, parents and children tended to use behaviours leading to a deterioration of relations between them and employed a very limited range of alternatives for conflict resolution.</description><creator>Dinh, Bich Thi.</creator><contributor>Smith, David (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Culture conflict -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><subject>Vietnamese Canadians -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><subject>High school students -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><title>A study of cultural conflict as experienced by adolescents of Vietnamese origin in Montreal secondary schools</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8k71nj899.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/79407z94j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Culture and Values in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:b2773x45m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:37:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The relationship between hopelessness and depression in a non-clinical sample of children (mean age = 10.75 years) was examined. A systematic comparison of three models of the role of hopelessness and global self-worth in childhood depression was conducted. The Children's Depression Inventory (Kovacs, 1983), the Self-Perception Profile for Students with Learning Disabilities (Renick &amp; Harter, 1988), and the Hopelessness Scale for Children (Kazdin, French, Unis, Esveldt-Dawson, &amp; Sherick, 1983) were administered. Results suggest that depressed children are hopeless but that hopeless children are not necessarily depressed; global self-worth and hopelessness are highly overlapping constructs; and no gender differences are present in childhood hopelessness. Results are interpreted with reference to the theoretical implications regarding the relative support of a new theory of depression and hopelessness, versus Greene's (1989) theory of the independence of hopelessness and depression as constructs, Beck's (1967) cognitive triad theory, and Haaga, Dyck, and Ernst's(1991) single dimension model of depression.</description><creator>Grinberg, Daisy I.</creator><contributor>Heath, Nancy (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Depression in children.</subject><subject>Self-esteem in children.</subject><title>Depression, hopelessness, and global self-worth in a non-clinical child sample</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fq977w76q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b2773x45m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q237ht50w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:37:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The current study was designed to examine sex differences in the stability of same-sex friendships. Based on past research, it was hypothesized that boys have more stable friendship nominations than girls. Four hundred fifty-one elementary and high school students from grades three, four, seven and eight completed questionnaires in which they were asked to nominate their closest friends. Friendship nominations were collected three times over a seventh month period, in the fall, winter and spring of the school year. Partial support was obtained for the hypothesis at the high school level: Adolescent boys had more stable friendship nominations than adolescent girls. No sex differences in stability were evident at the elementary level. At all grade levels, fewer friendship nominations were made at the beginning of the year and friendship stability was lowest over the longer time interval from fall to spring. Results are discussed in terms of the importance of the stability of friendships for peer social support.</description><creator>Christakos, Athena.</creator><contributor>Benenson, Joyce (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Sex differences (Psychology)</subject><subject>Friendship in children.</subject><subject>Friendship in adolescence.</subject><title>Sex differences in the stability of children's and adolescents' friendships</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/05741t53s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q237ht50w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6969z2636</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:37:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The claim that mentorships are particularly appropriate and in some ways unique educational experiences for high ability students was empirically tested. Students who had and had not taken part in a gifted, creative, or enrichment program (n = 39) completed a questionnaire that consisted of scenarios and statements addressing mentees' vocational and psychosocial needs. Of particular interest were the factor analyses generated from students' responses to the direct statements. As predicted, the high ability group preferred mentorships addressing psychosocial needs to those addressing vocational ones. All five psychosocial items loaded on factor 1, while nine of the 11 vocational items loaded on factor 2. For students who had not participated in a program for high ability pupils, a combination of vocational and psychosocial items loaded on factors 1 and 2. This suggested that these students shared a more general preference for mentoring relationships regardless of whether they addressed vocational or psychosocial needs.</description><creator>Casey, Kerry M.

The question governing the work concerns the extent to which the physical orientation, currently characterizing our society, is to be considered a productive response to the so-called "crisis of representation." A reading of Kerstin Ekinan's novel Blackwater (1996) is woven into and through the body of the work, indicating the shortcomings of theoretical understanding, the limitations of literary analysis, and the strength of literary narrative with respect to the issue in question. The distinction traditionally drawn between fashionable, transgressive and pathological ways of turning toward the body no longer holds. The blurring of the boundaries between self-making and self-destruction opens for a rather unexplored field of possibilities. 'Skin-Deep' Impressions takes as its point of departure the claim made by some postmodern thinkers, that the cultural climate in the Western part of the world has turned "schizophrenic." The enthusiasm with which the arrival of the "schizo" has been received, ironically and tragically, is out of touch with reality. The suggestion emerging from my work is that the bodily phenomenon serves as a request for the reinstitution of more common frames of reference. The focus on the texture of the flesh, on physical wounds, and on the experience of physical pain, is viewed not as a manifestation of a general sense of victimization but rather, as the manifestation of a need to reinvent forms of representation allowing for the realization of emotionally intense and often ambiguous experience. The violent turn toward the body, finally, is viewed as a collective means of coping with the social unconscious, that is with the guilt associated with the crimes committed in the name of progress in the Western world. In this manner, physicality comes to substitute for what is lacking, namely a more suitable metaphysics. Paradoxically then, body-fixated subjects, commonly perceived as being self-absorbed and asocial may in fact represent a most serious attempt at introducing respect for other living beings in a culture characterized by an increasingly split between notions of humanity and conditions of living.</description><creator>Rose, Gitte Braut.</creator><contributor>Raite, Berkeley (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Ohlin, Peter (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Ekman, Kerstin, 1933- Handelser vid vatten.</subject><subject>Body art.</subject><subject>Body, Human.</subject><title>'Skin-deep' impressions : somatic sense in an age of simulated significance</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hd76s187x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sn00b052k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6h440v371</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:37:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation explores the impact of gender ideologies held by medieval readerships on the production of books and circulation of texts in late medieval England. The first chapter explores how the professional book trade of late medieval London circulated booklets of Chauceriana which constructed masculinity and femininity in strict adherence to the courtly love literary tradition. In the second chapter, I demonstrate that such a standardized representation of courtly gender could be adapted by a readership removed from the professional book trade, in this case the rural gentry producers of the Findern manuscript, who present a revised vision of femininity and courtliness in their anthology. This revised femininity includes several texts which privilege the female speaking voice. The third chapter goes on to investigate the use of the female voice in one particular genre, the love lyric, and asks if the female lyric speaker can be associated with manuscripts in which women participated as producers or readers. Finally, the fourth chapter turns to masculinity, examining how the commonplace book of an early 16th century grocer, Richard Hill, contains selections from didactic and recreational literature which reinforce the ideals of masculine conduct in the merchant community of late medieval London. The dissertation concludes that manuscript contexts must be taken into account when reading gender in medieval English literature.</description><creator>Rogers, Janine.</creator><contributor>Westphal, Sarah (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Book industries and trade -- Great Britain -- History.</subject><subject>Gender identity in literature.</subject><subject>Books and reading -- Great Britain -- History.</subject><title>Gender and the literature culture of late medieval England</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zc77sr71w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6h440v371</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8s45qb603</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:37:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study examines reasons why successful and dedicated women classroom teachers become disillusioned with teaching. The four women teachers who participated in this study embody the "good and ideal" woman teacher. Yet, over a three year period of time during which we engaged in a written correspondence, they disclosed personal stories about teaching that showed their anger, pain and disillusionment. The purpose of drawing on the narratives of these women was two-fold. First, I wanted their stories to better inform my practice as a teacher educator. I reasoned that if it is successful and dedicated women teachers who become disillusioned with teaching, then it follows that their stories are worth listening to. For pre-service teachers who enter teaching for any number of reasons, these stories help us to better understand the entirety of what it means "to be a teacher". Second, I wanted to situate their stories throughout the body of literature on women teachers that challenges age-old stereotypes and the notion of teaching as "women's work". Of particular interest to the study was their silence, their unwillingness to give voice to these feelings. As such, I named this essence I was seeking to better understand, "teacher shadows": those stories that dedicated and successful women teachers are reluctant to tell, but highlight their feelings of being devalued by a society that doubts their abilities, and a structure of schooling that has little room for shared authority.</description><creator>Rumin, Anna C.</creator><contributor>Mitchell, Claudia (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Women teachers.</subject><subject>Women -- Employment.</subject><subject>Teachers -- Attitudes.</subject><title>Teacher shadows : giving voice to hidden selves</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p5547t23k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8s45qb603</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cc08hh27b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:37:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this study was to examine power output and fatigue from power-time curves of cycle ergometer and isokinetic dynamometer tests. Fifteen physically active female university athletes performed a 45 s cycle ergometer test at resistances of 0.075, 0.085, and 0.095 kp/kg bw, as well as a 45 s and a 3 repetition isokinetic flexion and extension test at velocities of 60, 180, and 300$ sp circ$/s. Results revealed that peak power, mean power (W and W/kg), and fatigue (W/kg) were highest at the 0.095 kp/kg bw resistance and lowest at the 0.075 kp/kg bw resistance. Significant differences among the three cycle ergometer conditions existed for peak power, mean power, and fatigue. Peak power and mean power (W and W/kg) were highest at 300$ sp circ$/s and lowest at 60$ sp circ$/s. Results revealed significant differences among the isokinetic dynamometer conditions for peak and mean power.

The study looks at the various nested contexts of the two case studies at the international, national, provincial, school and classroom levels with respect to Zimbabwe before and after independence in 1980. The analysis of the nested contexts aims to show how the various factors at the different levels impinge on the ESL instruction of the two teachers. The study adopts a naturalistic, classroom-based approach that allows for the holistic investigation of teacher-learner interactions in socially-situated cognitive instruction. Specific research questions addressed are: (a) What are the classroom interaction patterns of each of the two teachers selected for the study? What do these patterns and the teachers! classroom artifacts reveal about their beliefs about the construction of social knowledge at secondary school level? (b) How does each teacher in the study construct academic knowledge in his/her ESL instruction? What do the patterns of construction and the teachers' classroom artifacts reveal about their beliefs about the instruction of ESL academic knowledge at the secondary school level? The study uses tools of data collection and analysis from constitutive ethnography and ethnomethodology. Data from interviews, classroom observations, field notes, artifacts and documents are analyzed to see what they reveal about each teacher's beliefs about ESL instruction. Four major themes emerge from the analysis of these data: (a) teachers' beliefs about curriculum documents; (b) teachers; beliefs about ESL models for instruction; (c) teachers' beliefs about interactional rights and obligations in the classroom and (d) teachers' beliefs about teaching linguistic and communicative competence. A major finding of this inquiry is that the two selected teachers, guided by their personal beliefs, respond in different ways to the many contextual factors that impinge on their teaching, giving rise to each teacher's unique teaching repertoires. In the fight of this major finding, it is recommended that ESL teacher education programmes in Zimbabwe begin with the student teachers' beliefs rather than the traditional "method" paradigm.</description><creator>Nyawaranda, Vitalis.</creator><contributor>Donin, Janet (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>English teachers -- Zimbabwe -- Attitudes.</subject><subject>English language -- Study and teaching -- Foreign speakers -- Case studies.</subject><title>Teachers' beliefs about teaching English as a second language (ESL) : two case studies of ESL instruction in Zimbabwe</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wp988m789.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zc77sr725</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Second Language Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k3569618c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:37:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Programmed cell death (apoptosis) is a fundamental process in multicellular organisms. The human proto-oncogene bcl-2 functions to suppress apoptosis and promote cell survival. It is the-most studied apoptotic regulator, yet the mechanism of action of this protein remains elusive. We have identified p28Bap31 as a Bcl-2 associating protein which also interacts with Bcl-XL. p28Bap31 is a polytopic integral membrane protein which resides primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum with an N lumen-Ccyto orientation. This orientation exposes the COOH-terminal leucine zipper overlapping with a weak death effector domain, flanked on either side by caspase cleavage sites, to the cytosol. In the absence of Bcl-2, p28Bap31 is cleaved during apoptosis mediated by E1A generating a 20kDa product, p20Bap31. On the contrary, expression of Bcl-2 suppresses cell death and blocks the proteolytic cleavage of p28Bap31. In vitro cleavage studies suggested that p28Bap31 is a substrate for caspase-8, an initiator caspase, but not for effector caspases such as caspase-3. Although it is not known whether the cleavage of p28Bap31 contributes to the cell death program, ectopic expression of p20 can trigger apoptosis which can be rescued by co-expression of Bcl-2. To date, it is not clear how p20 induces apoptosis. However, it is possible that it does so by amplification of the caspase cascade, or by activation of a parallel pathway. In cotransfected 293T cells, p28Bap31 associates simultaneously with both BCl-XL and procaspase-8, presumably depending on the presence of a Ced-4-like adaptor molecule. The direct interaction between p28Bap31 and C. elegans Ced-4 suggests that a mammalian Ced-4-like molecule may be a normal constituent of the p28Bap31 protein complex in the ER. It also further supports the idea that p28Bap31 plays a role in the regulation of apoptosis. Moreover, the function of this protein complex may be analogous to the Fas/TNFR1 death-inducing signaling complexes by providing an intracellular site for the recruitment of procaspase-8. The presence of Bcl-2-like proteins may act to prevent the processing and activation of the initiator caspase, thereby inhibiting downstream events culminating in cell death.</description><creator>Ng, Florence Wai Hung.</creator><contributor>Shore, Gordon (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Identification and characterization of Bcl-2Bcl-XL interacting protein p28Bap31</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nk322g08v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k3569618c</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:47429b989</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:37:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Phytosterols occur naturally in the non-saponifiable material of plant oils. Sitostanol, the saturated derivative of beta-sitosterol, is found in negligible concentrations in plant sources and, hence, is almost absent from typical Western diets. Tall oil extracts, on the other hand, contain about 20% (w/w) sitostanol. Phytosterols have been shown to lower plasma total cholesterol levels in animals and humans while sitostanol exhibited stronger reducing effects. Several studies have suggested that phytosterols lower plasma total cholesterol levels by either inhibiting cholesterol absorption or altering the activities of enzymes critical in cholesterol metabolism and excretion. However, results obtained demonstrate inconsistency regarding the effects of phytosterols on cholesterol absorption rates and cholesterogenesis. In addition, few studies have determined quantitatively the changes in the rate of cholesterol absorption and biosynthesis. Hence, the objective of this thesis was to investigate further the impact of different sources of phytosterols on plasma lipid profiles and to develop a new methodology for simultaneous measurement of percent cholesterol absorption and cholesterol synthesis rates in animals and humans. The stable isotopes, 13C-, 18 O-cholesterol, and deuterium oxide were utilized for the dual isotope plasma ratio and deuterium uptake methodologies. Results from the series of animal experiments conducted demonstrate (i) a gender effect of phytosterols in modulating plasma lipid profile in hamsters, (ii) that sitostanol was more potent in lowering plasma and hepatic lipid concentrations than beta-sitosterol in hamsters and rabbits and (iii) that this lowering effect was due to a reduction in fractional cholesterol absorption and an increase in cholesterol excretion rates. Concomitantly, an up-regulation in cholesterogenesis was observed in hamsters. Furthermore, in humans tall oil phytosterols lowered total cholesterol levels in hypercholesterole</description><creator>Ntanios, Fady Y.</creator><contributor>Jones, Peter (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Phytosterols.</subject><subject>Cholesterol -- Metabolism.</subject><title>Cholesterol lowering efficacy of plant sterols : mechanisms of action</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tt44pp76c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/47429b989</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8w32r730m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:37:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Interferon Regulatory Factors (IRFs) are a family of interferon-inducible proteins which play distinct roles in diverse processes such as pathogen response, cytokine signalling, cell growth regulation and hematopoietic development. The objective of this research was to investigate the mechanisms by which IRF-1 and IRF-2 regulate gene expression and cell growth. Structure-function analyses of the IRF-2 protein demonstrate that transcriptional repression by IRF-2 is contained within the first 125 N-terminal amino acids and correlates directly with IRF-2 DNA binding. Overexpression of functional IRF-2 deletion mutant proteins in NIH3T3 cells results in oncogenic transformation and tumorigenesis, suggesting that IRF-2 oncogenicity correlates directly with transcriptional repression. Similar structure-function analyses localize IRF-1 transactivation to the C-terminus. Like IRF-1, hybrid constructs which fuse the DNA binding domain of IRF-1 and IRF-2 to the transactivation domain of NF-kappaB RelA(p65) are transcriptional activators. Inducible expression of IRF-1 and IRF/RelA in NIH3T3 cells results in reduced cellular growth and induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, expression of the PKR, STAT1(p91), and WAF1 growth regulatory proteins are elevated following induction of IRF-1 or IRF/RelA, correlating transactivation function and tumor suppressor activity of IRF-1 or IRF/RelA. By RNA fingerprinting, the secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) was identified as the first gene whose expression is downregulated by IRF-1 or IRF-1/RelA. A region in the SLPI promoter was identified that bound IRF-1, suggesting a direct mechanism for IRF-1 regulation of SLPI expression.</description><creator>Nguyen, Hannah Anh-Quan.</creator><contributor>Hiscott, John (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Regulation of gene expression and cell growth by transcriptional proteins of the interferon system</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pg15bg76d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8w32r730m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5m60qt777</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:37:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis introduces a new approach to the problem of estimating the parameters of a dynamic model of a robotic manipulator using force-and-motion data collected from the manipulator. As an alternative to commonly used least-square estimation techniques, bounded-error estimation is proposed, whereby worst-case bounds on the parameter estimates are computed based upon non-restrictive assumptions on the total error in the data, which can include systematic errors arising from unmodelled dynamics of the robot. It is argued that computing such worst-case bounds gives one a direct assessment of the accuracy, not only the precision, of the parameter estimates and offers insight into the usefulness of the model itself. As a means of dealing with the complexity of the robot dynamics equations, the use of special test motions is adopted. By considering a very general definition of a test motion, it is shown how a large number of simplified dynamics equations can be generated in symbolic form for a given robot dynamics model, each of which may have unique properties beneficial in the context of robot parameter estimation. The use of a sequence of test motions for estimating all identifiable parameters of a dynamic model is then discussed. The "best" test-motion sequence is defined as one that minimizes an objective function that is the average of the uncertainties in the parameters it estimates. An evolutionary-type algorithm for estimating the identifiable parameters in a robot dynamics model is then described. This algorithm searches for the "best" test-motion sequence described above. The algorithm maintains a population of individuals, each of which is a test-motion sequence. As the algorithm runs, test-motion sequences grow and recombine into larger test-motion sequences, and undergo a selection process whereby only the better test-motion sequences survive, as defined by the above-mentioned objective function. In order to sample a broad but manageable area of the search space of test-motion sequences, the algorithm features the use of a heuristic initial population generation algorithm that produces an initial population of "good" test-motion sequences based upon qualitative symbolic properties of the test-motion equations. A new method for determining "exciting" trajectories for robot parameter estimation experiments is described. This method is distinguished from methods reported in the literature in that it is purely symbolic and is geared to the use of special test motions. The method is demonstrated on a stand-alone example. Then, it is described how the method can be incorporated in the preceding heuristic initial population generation algorithm. The evolutionary robot parameter estimation algorithm is then tested experimentally using data from an actual Puma 560 industrial robot. The algorithm is run separately using both the joint-torque model and the base-reaction models. It is shown that meaningful estimate bounds can be obtained for many of the parameters, and correspond with previous estimates reported in the literature.</description><creator>Lucyshyn, Robert.</creator><contributor>Angeles, Jorge (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Estimation of inertial parameters of robotic manipulators</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8w32r731w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5m60qt777</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5d86p203b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:37:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The objective of this study is to gain an understanding of the factors which influence and control the formation of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) chemisorbed on metal surfaces and how these SAMs modulate electron transfer kinetics. To achieve this purpose various alkyl thiol-SAMs with chain lengths from C4SH to C22SH and terminal functional groups such as -CO2H, -OH, -NH2, and -SO3- were prepared on gold surfaces. The electron transfer processes across thiol-SAMs have been extensively studied by electrochemical techniques including cyclic voltammetry and rotating disk electrode (RDE) voltammetry. RDE results indicate that a thiol monolayer greatly reduces the electron-transfer rate at the interface. From the current versus concentration relationships of several redox probes including K 3Fe(CN)6, Ru(NH3)6Cl3, (Bu 4N)3Fe(CN)6, and Co(bpy)Cl2, a partition mechanism is proposed. This mechanism accounts for the observation of saturation in current/concentration plots. Simulations of a pinhole/defects model and the partition model show that saturation in current/concentration curves occurs only in the partition model. Studies show that short-chain thiols adsorbed on gold surfaces can lower the interfacial energy and promote aniline polymerization. Long chain thiol SAMs do not block aniline polymerization. A homogeneous polyaniline film was proposed to be formed in, and on, long-chain thiol SAMs. Such a polyaniline exhibits better conductivity than that of polyaniline formed on bare gold. The voltammetric behavior of dopamine, ascorbic acid, and their mixture has been described at HSC11CO2H-modified Au electrodes. Complex redox processes involving the thiol-Au bond evident only under high sweep rate conditions were found. Depending upon such redox processes, dopamine at levels as low as 1nM can be detected. Such sensitivity is essential for the in vivo application of the o-carboxylic acid thiol SAM/Au electrode. The adsorption process of the thiol monolayer was showed to be electrochemically accessible. Control of electrode potential during the adsorption process apparently assists thiol self-assembly. Potential control allows for the formation of monolayers in a relatively short time and is more likely to be defect free than monolayers prepared under passive adsorption conditions. The potential deposition process allows one to control the ratio of components in a C 16SH/HSC15CO2H mixed monolayer.</description><creator>Ma, Fuyuan.</creator><contributor>Lennox, R.
