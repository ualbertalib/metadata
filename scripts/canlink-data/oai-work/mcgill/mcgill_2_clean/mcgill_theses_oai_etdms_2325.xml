Several lines of evidence suggest that this effect is mediated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors located on the neurons of the mesolimbic dopaminergic (MLDA) pathway. However, a report published recently has challenged this idea, finding that destruction of the MLDA with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), a catecholamine specific neurotoxin, had no effect on nicotine-induced hyperlocomotion. The objective of this thesis was therefore to re-examine the role of the MLDA in mediating the locomotor stimulant effect of nicotine in rats. Vehicle or 6-OHDA was bilaterally infused into the ventral tegmental area, the somatodendritic region of the MLDA pathway, of rats that had been pre-treated with nicotine. Drug-induced locomotor activity was then assessed. The locomotor activity of lesioned animals in response to nicotine (0.4 mg/kg base sc) and amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg salt sc) decreased by 75% and 87% respectively in comparison to non-lesioned rats, while the saline and scopolamine-induced (0.5 mg/kg salt sc) locomotor activity was not significantly altered. Autoradiographic examination of rat brains using 125[I]-RTI 55, a dopamine transporter ligand, revealed that binding within the cell body and terminal region of the MLDA pathway was decreased by 70% and 85% respectively in lesioned animals. A significant correlation (r = 0.68) was found between 125[I]-RTI 55 binding in the nucleus accumbens, the main projection of the MLDA system, and nicotine-induced locomotor activity. These findings strongly implicate the MLDA pathway in mediating the locomotor stimulant effect of nicotine in rats.</description><creator>Louis, Mariam.</creator><contributor>Clarke, Paul (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</subject><title>The contribution of mesolimbic dopamine to the locomotor stimulant effect of nicotine /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sb397b39h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2z10ws51t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:c247dv314</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:20:08Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We report here the use of RAPD-PCR (Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA - Polymerase Chain Reaction) to identify segregating loci in the haploid progeny of an Armillaria ostoyae basidiocarp and the construction of the first genetic linkage map of this fungus, one of the causal species of Armillaria Root Disease. Upon screening 75 RAPD primers, 18 were found to identify a total of 43 loci segregating with a 1 : 1 Mendelian ratio. These loci were analysed for linkage among 58 monospore progeny. The map constructed with Mapmaker (LOD = 3.0, r = 0.38) was confirmed by GMendel (LOD = 1.5, r = 0.38). This map arranged 30 loci into 6 linkage groups and 4 linkage pairs. Thirteen markers remained unlinked. Using the Kosambi mapping function the linked loci accounted for approximately 450 cM and the genome was estimated to be 1600 cM.

ORB utilizes the QUADRIS sensor platform developed at the Centre for Intelligent Machines (CIM) at McGill University, which is composed of two BIRIS2 laser rangefinders. ORB performs a series of sensory and perceptual tasks in conjunction with a mobile robot control architecture called SPOTT. ORB's main task is to sense the mobile robot's surroundings and provide laser range data, in the form of line segments, for SPOTT's map database. In an office environment, ORB also identifies and labels the structural objects (i.e., walls, doors) in this map. While navigating through an office space, the mobile robot may be required to search for certain objects in the area. In these scenarios, ORB is used to recognize the movable objects (i.e., chairs, tables and desks). ORB is able to perform its tasks in a fast and efficient manner by using simple models to represent the structural and movable objects in its database. ORB's recognition procedures only require sparse sets of range scans to identify the aforementioned objects. The structural object models are built from prior knowledge of the office environment. For example, the doorway model would consist of the known doorway widths found on the experimental office floor. ORB has been tested extensively in the CIM environment, but it can also be applied to any office space provided the structural dimensions are known a priori. ORB's models for the movable objects are idealized descriptions with the object's surfaces represented by planes. The physical dimensions of the movable object models are defined by Architectural Standards, as office furniture are built to conform to these standards. 1A system for O̲bject R̲ecognition and map B̲uilding using the QUADRIS sensor platform on a mobile robot. 2Official trademark of the National Research Council of Canada.</description><creator>Bui, Don T.</creator><contributor>Levine, M.

A triplex and a duplex assay were created involving Sry and Dax, a single copy X chromosome gene which is involved in the female sex determination pathway. The third sequence in the triplex assay was a repetitive Y chromosome sequence, YR. A minimum of 2.5 x 10-3 to 2.5 x 10 -4 m g/ m L of male DNA and 2.5 x 10-5 m g/ m L of female DNA was required if a single multiplex PCR was performed. To demonstrate that sex determination of preimplantation porcine embryos is possible, morulae were collected 5 d post insemination from pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin (PMSG)/human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG)-treated 60--70 kg prepubertal gilts. Embryos were biopsied using a micromanipulator and cells were placed into individual microcentrifuge tubes for further analysis. Embryos were then cultured to the blastocyst stage. A total of 315 embryos were sexed via the PCR assay with a resultant female/male (%) ratio of 73/27. When 94 embryos from heavier gilts (90--100 kg) were sexed in a similar assay, the resultant female/male ratio was 60/40. Attempts were made to correlate these results with karyotypes. Five transfers of sexed embryos into synchronized recipients were attempted. None of these resulted in pregnancies; although return to estrus was delayed by two to eight days, in four out of the five recipients. Our findings suggest that PCR amplification of the Sry gene can be a reliable method for sexing porcine embryos. It does appear that embryo quality is critical for both the PCR assay and subsequent successful culture.

The superior colliculus may be responsible for residual abilities in the blind field because of its predominant subsidiary visual connections with the retina. Ten normal subjects and four patients with a temporal lobe removal served as controls for four experimental subjects (two hemispherectomized and two partial hemispherectomized). The experiment tested three tasks that measured reaction time and localization accuracy: (1) visual target only; (2) auditory target only; (3) simultaneous auditory and visual (aud/vis) stimuli at the same location. Only reaction time was measured in the condition where simultaneous presentations of aud/vis stimuli were made at different locations. The existence of blindsight was substantiated for localization, but not for reaction time in the blind field of hemispherectomy patients. None of the subjects demonstrated multisensory integration for reaction time and localization accuracy. Our results indicate that multisensory integration did not take place, at least with the types of stimuli used here. A role of the superior colliculus in blindsight remains possible since the hemispherectomy subjects still showed unconscious residual visual abilities in their blind field.</description><creator>Zive, Kevin.</creator><contributor>Ptito, Alain (advisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Integration of visual and auditory spatial stimuli in the blind field of hemispherectomy patients</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rf55z994t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94hr820</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0g354h496</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:20:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Carbon storage was compared between two perennial biomass energy systems, namely switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and short-rotation willow Salix alba x glaffelteri L.) at 2 adjacent sites, and further compared with a corn cultivation, a 20-year-old abandoned field, and a mature hardwood forest, in southwestern Quebec. Aboveground carbon results indicated that switchgrass and corn had significantly greater carbon levels than willow at the less fertile site, but no significant differences were detected at the more fertile site. Root carbon results indicated that corn had significantly lower carbon levels than both perennial systems to a depth of 30 cm at both sites. However, switchgrass had significantly greater root carbon levels beyond 30 cm compared with willow and corn, and beyond 45 cm compared with the forest and abandoned field. These findings indicate that deep-rooted perennial grasses such as switchgrass have the potential to sequester carbon at deeper soil layers. Soil carbon results showed that at the more fertile site, willow was associated with significantly greater soil carbon levels than switchgrass. Moreover, both perennial crops had soil carbon levels that were greater than for corn, the abandoned field, and the forest. In contrast, at the less fertile site, no significant differences in soil carbon were detected between the various plant systems examined. The results of this study suggest that the perennial energy crops used, when grown on relatively fertile soils, have the potential to substantially increase soil carbon levels compared with conventional agricultural and/or forest systems. Consequently, when these crops are grown on less fertile soils, their added advantage of increasing carbon storage is lost.</description><creator>Zan, Claudia.</creator><contributor>Fyles, James W.

In the present study the phase transitions associated with polymorphism behavior of common food fats were investigated. The polymorphism of butters, margarines, cocoa butter and cocoa butter products were determined and the effects of certain ingredients and conditions of temperature were studied. The following polymorphic forms were detected: sub-alpha, alpha, beta' , beta'3, beta' 2, beta, beta2, and beta1; however, not all forms were observed in all fats. Margarines contained beta' and beta forms depending on their fat constituents, while butter, cocoa butter, and fat blends consisted of alpha, beta' and beta; only the beta' form of butter showed a sharp melting point. Rapeseed oil exhibited alpha, beta1 and beta 2 forms, depending on the degree of hydrogenation. DSC measurements of fat blends were correlated with viscosity index measurements from Universal Material Testing Machine (UMTM) using a single cycle, back extrusion technique. A correlation of R2 = 0.70 (p = 0.95) was obtained. Viscosity index decreased as temperature increased, suggesting a possible relationship between viscosity index and solid fat fraction. This suggests that viscosity index could be a potential indicator of food fat textural properties which are evaluated by DSC.

The data used are monthly SIC and SLP anomalies, which cover the Northern Hemisphere north of 450 and extend over the 38-year period 1954--1991. One goal of the thesis is to describe the spatial and temporal variability of SIC and atmospheric circulation on interannual and decadal timescales. Another goal is to investigate the nature and strength of the air-ice interactions. The air-ice interactions are investigated in detail in the first SVD mode of the coupled variability, which is characterized by decadal-to-interdecadal timescales. Subsequently, the nature and strength of the air-ice interactions are studied in the second SVD mode, which shows a long-term trend. The interactions in the third SVD mode which has an interannual timescale are briefly mentioned.

This thesis gives a survey of a few modern authentication schemes. It pays special attention to Undeniable Signature Schemes and their applications.

A form of Undeniable Signatures is implemented in the process of understanding the scheme and the mechanism of the technique.</description><creator>Yeung, Jacqueline Fai.</creator><contributor>Avis, David (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Crepeau, Claude (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Digital signatures : a survey of undeniable signatures</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7w62fb538.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zc77ss047</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:76537326j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:20:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The overall objective of this research was to investigate the feasibility of using artificial neural networks to detect the incidence of clinical bovine mastitis and to determine the major factors influencing it. The first part of this research was devoted to a general examination of the learning ability of artificial neural networks by training them with relatively small data sets. These data sets (a total of 460,474 records) contained suspected indicators of mastitis such as milk production, stage of lactation and somatic cell count, and it was hoped that artificial neural networks would be able to detect what statistical modelling had already established elsewhere in the literature. The second part of this research was extended to examine the roles of more information resources such as conformation traits and their genetic values---factors that have not been studied extensively, with either conventional approaches or emerging technologies like artificial neural networks.

The interaction of airway hyperresponsiveness to contractile agonists and the atopic constitution of the animals with responsiveness to hyperpnea challenge was also evaluated. A hyperresponsive strain, Fisher 344, two control normoresponsive strains, Lewis and ACI, and an atopic but normoresponsive rat, Brown Norway (BN) to dry gas hyperpnea challenge were studied. The effects of the NK1 (CP-99994), the NK2 (SR-48968) receptor antagonists, and the selective LTD4 receptor antagonist pranlukast on responses to hyperpnea challenge were examined in BN rats. The animals were anesthetized with xylazine and pentobarbital sodium intraperitoneally and mechanically ventilated with a tidal volume of 8 ml/kg and a frequency of 150 breaths/min for hyperpnea challenge. Pulmonary responses to challenge were measured in spontaneously breathing animals. Dry gas hyperpnea challenge was performed with a dry mixture of 5% CO2-95% O2 for 5 min whereas wet gas was humidified prior to administration. Bronchovascular leakage was assessed by quantitating Evans blue in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid.

The conventional heat-based drying methods often produce changes in the physico-chemical properties of products. A newly developed electrohydrodynamic (EHD) drying technique may be much less destructive to these heat-sensitive materials. This thesis presents comparative analyses of product deterioration in EHD-dried whey proteins, using electrophoresis, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and color measurements. Gel electrophoresis showed the disappearance of bands and reduction in band intensities depending upon the temperature of the oven in which the whey protein was dried. The thermograms of the differential scanning calorimeter varied considerably as the temperature of oven-drier increased. EHD, air-drying, and their combination showed no significant change in the electrophoretograms and thermograms compared with the native protein. Color measurements also indicated no significant change in color of EHD-dried whey protein whereas oven-drying produced darker colors from the original. These results allowed us to conclude that physico-chemical properties of whey protein remained intact after drying with EHD.</description><creator>Xue, Xin, 1972-</creator><contributor>Barthakuy, N.

These studies showed that H. contortus larvae possess substantially more glutamate binding sites with lower affinity than adults. Moreover, selection with ivermectin was associated with an increase in the number of glutamate binding sites in adults and an increase in the affinity for glutamate binding in larvae. When investigating the effects of ivermectin on glutamate binding kinetics, it was discovered that ivermectin decreased Bmax values in unselected, but not in ivermectin-selected, parasites. Inulin intake studies were performed in unselected and ivermectin-selected H. contortus worms to relate the glutamate binding results to the biological activity, pharyngeal pumping. These studies showed that glutamate, ivermectin and the structurally similar anthelmintic, moxidectin, inhibit pharyngeal pumping, and that glutamate influences the effects of ivermectin and of moxidectin, on pharyngeal pumping. Lastly, selection with ivermectin was associated with an alteration of the effects of ivermectin, but not moxidectin, on pharyngeal pumping. The results of this work suggest that a novel ivermectin-sensitive, glutamate receptor, which influences pharyngeal function, is involved in the development of ivermectin resistance in H. contortus.</description><creator>Paiement, Jean-Pierre.</creator><date>1998</date><subject>Ivermectin.</subject><subject>Sheep -- Parasites.</subject><subject>Drug resistance.</subject><subject>Haemonchus contortus.</subject><title>Characterization of a glutamate binding site in susceptible and ivermectin-selected Haemonchus contortus</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fb494b465.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kw52jb11h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Parasitology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8p58pg13p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:20:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Four separate polynucleotide kinase activities were observed following Polymin P precipitation of crude extract of calf thymus tissue (Prinos et al., 1995). A single activity designated Polymin P-Precipitable Polynucleotide Kinase (PP-PNK) was detected in the pellet fraction. The other three separable activities, designated SNQl, SNQII and SNQIII, were found in the supernatant fraction after chromatography on a Q-Sepharose column. The PP-PNK activity was purified 4,200 fold after 6 purification steps. The PP-PNK preparation preferentially used ATP as a gamma-phosphoryl donor compared with GTP. Chromatography on a Sephadex G-150 column demonstrated that it had a molecular weight of 130 kDa. Immunoblot analysis using an anti-peptide antibody raised against a purified fetal bovine polynucleotide kinase revealed no signal in the PP-PNK preparation suggesting that PP-PNK is distinct from SNQI and fetal calf thymus DNA kinase-phosphatase. Biochemical analyses of SNQIII preparation revealed a pH optimum of 5.5 to 6.0 and required Mg2+ for activity. Studies with different oligonucleotide substrates showed that for PP-PNK, the activity profile was: dT20 &gt; rA20 &gt; dA20 whereas for SNQI, it was as follows: dA20 &gt; dT20 &gt; rA20. Both SNQIIIa and SNQIIIb samples had the same profile: dA20 ≈ dT20 &gt; rA20. A homology based PCR approach to isolate cDNAs encoding mammalian PNKs was developed. To date, no positive clones have been identified using human thymus and a human lymphoblast cDNA library as template DNA.</description><creator>Ong, Colin Heng Piew.</creator><date>1997</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><title>Biochemical properties of two bovine polynucleotide kinases and a homology-based polymerase chain reaction strategy for identification of the corresponding genes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ws859h81v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8p58pg13p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xs55mf022</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:20:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The kinetics of moisture loss and solids gain during osmotic dehydration of blueberries under different conditions of temperature (37--60°C), concentration of the sucrose solution (47--70°Brix) and contact time between fruit and sucrose solution (0.5--5.5 h) were studied, and modeled based on Fick's law of unsteady state diffusion. The rates of moisture loss and solids gain were also related to temperature and sucrose concentration.

Osmotic dehydration pre-treatments included different combinations of temperature, sucrose concentration and contact time. Fick's second law of unsteady state diffusion was used to model the air drying kinetics. The quality of two-stage osmo-convective dried blueberries with respect to color, texture and rehydration ratio was evaluated. The parameters analyzed for color were the total color difference (DeltaE) and, the (a/b) ratio as the indicator for the red-blue color.

For both chlorophenols, the log Kow exhibits pH dependence in the range pKa-1 &lt; pH &lt; pK a+2. At lower and higher pH values, the Kow behaviour of the chlorophenols is independent of pH. Our data, in conjunction with those of Westall et al. (1985), indicate that a linear relationship exists Our data, in conjunction with those of Westall et al.

Our results r results also suggest that aqueous metal-chlorophenol ate complexation can significantly alter the also suggest that aqueous metal-chlorophenolate complexation can significantly alter the partitioning behaviour. We use our data to develop an empirical model of the partitioning behaviour based on speciation of the aqueous chlorophenol. The model requires knowledge of the low pH partitioning behaviour, as well as the acidity constant (pK a) of the chlorophenol of interest. Although Kow values have been measured as a function of pH and/or ionic strength for only pentachlorophenol, the input parameters for the empirical model are readily available in the literature for many chlorophenols. The model greatly expands our ability to quantify the hydrophobicity of chlorophenols, facilitating accurate estimations of the pH and ionic strength dependencies of the partitioning behaviour over a wide range of pH and ionic strength values of environmental interest.</description><creator>Nowosielski, B.

Bioinformatics provides the tools to study the interface between the two. If a particular locus in the human genome could have 100 discrete alleles, then the genome (comprising an estimated 80,000 genes), could harbor 8 million different alleles. To record information about each of these alleles in a meaningful and systematic fashion is a task for the Mutation Database domain of bioinformatics. The HUGO Mutation Database Initiative is an international effort to capture, record and distribute information about variation in genomes. This initiative comprises a growing number of Locus-Specific Mutation databases, and a few large Federated Genomic databases [Cotton et al., 1998]. Here I present work on a well recognized prototypical Locus-Specific database: PAHdb. PAHdb is a relatively large curated relational database. This graduate project has had two major aims: to improve PAHdb , by careful analysis of version 1.0 and revision of its design, resulting in PAHdb version 2.0; to document the redesign process and share the experience by the conception of guidelines for content and structure of mutation databases in general.

An increase in expression of the neuronal IF subunit gefiltin in goldfish retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) has been linked to the unique ability of the goldfish optic nerve to regenerate following injury. Evidence suggests that the optic tectum may regulate the expression of gefiltin during regeneration. The goal of this thesis was to determine the function of the tectum in the regulation of gefiltin mRNA expression during optic fiber regeneration in the goldfish. It was found that gefiltin mRNA levels in the RGCs of animals that received an optic nerve crush (ONC group) increased by 10 days, peaked from 20 to 38 days at around 5.5-fold over normal, and declined to near normal by 115 days. In animals that had the entire tectum removed and an optic nerve crush (ETR group), gefiltin mRNA levels increased by 10 days, peaked at 20 days at around 5.5- to 6.5-fold over normal, and although they dropped slightly thereafter, they remained elevated at around 5-fold over normal for at least 115 days. When axons regenerated to the ipsilateral tectal lobe as a result of a left tectal lobe removal and left eye removal surgery the expression pattern of gefiltin mRNA paralleled that of the ONC group. It was also found that the abundance of gefiltin subunits in the retina was elevated at 30 days of regeneration in ONC and ETR animals, and that levels in the nerve were reconstituted to 80% of normal by 30 days. These results demonstrate that increases in gefiltin mRNA and protein levels during optic nerve regeneration are independent of the tectum, whereas the downregulation of gefiltin mRNA levels is entirely dependent upon the tectum.

One way to gain a better understanding of the function of these genes in oocyte determination, is to identify genes which interact with them.

By deficiency screening, I have identified two different loci which act as dominant enhancers of Bic-D, and eight different loci which act as dominant suppressors of Bic-D.

Under conditions of low food availability, 24- and 48-hr transition probabilities of all larval instars, to the next were reduced. Increases in food availability reversed this process, causing significant decreases in same-stage transition probabilities. However, as transition to successive stages increased among first, second, third and fourth instars, there was concomitant significant increase in first and fourth preimago mortality. Addition of Plagiorchis elegans cercariae caused significant decreases in the 24 and 48-hour same-state probabilities for all pre-imago stages. Successive stage transitions for first, second and third instars were significantly increased while those of fourth instars and pupae were significantly decreased following exposure to the parasites. The mortality of all preimago stages significantly increased with exposure to parasite, but was highest among fourth instars and pupae. There were strong food-by-parasite interaction effects among first, second and third instars. Differences in transition probabilities increased with increasing food levels between controlled and parasite-exposed groups. The opposite was true for fourth instars and pupae. While there was no significant interactive effect between food and the presence of the parasite on pupae regardless of food concentration, this was not true for mortality probabilities among fourth instars. Significantly more fourth instars died in response to parasite exposure and there were significant interactive effects of food and parasites on the probability of fourth instars transformation to pupae over 48 hrs.</description><creator>Nguyen, Duyen.</creator><date>1998</date><subject>Plagiorchiidae.</subject><subject>Aedes aegypti -- Larvae.</subject><subject>Aedes aegypti -- Food.</subject><subject>Aedes aegypti -- Parasites.</subject><title>Nutrition, competition and mortality : the impact of Plagiorchis elegans on the development of Aedes aegypti</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0c483m307.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7w62fb54j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rj430686h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:20:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Self-cycling fermentation (SCF) control was applied to a semi-continuous, aerobic, fixed-film reactor for the treatment of simulated and real brewery wastewater. The simulated wastewater was treated at 25°C. After approximately 3 hrs, 86% to 96% of the soluble BOD (SBOD) was removed, producing an effluent with a SBOD between 169 mg/L and 412 mg/L. The treatment of real brewery wastewater was undertaken at 25°C and 35°C, and was operated under ammonia-nitrogen deficient condition. 83% to 92% of the total BOD (TBOD) was removed after 3 hrs at 25°C, and after 1.5 to 2 hrs at 35°C. The treated effluent produced had a TBOD between 120 and 438 mg/L. The suspended solids in the treated effluent contributed between 63% and 71% of the TBOD. Hence, better treatment efficiency would have been possible if an efficient clarifier was installed, or the suspended solids were removed from the brewery wastewater prior to treatment.</description><creator>Nguyen, Anh-Long.</creator><date>1998</date><subject>Brewery waste.</subject><subject>Fermentation.</subject><subject>Water -- Purification -- Biological treatment.</subject><subject>Bioreactors.</subject><title>Application of self-cycling fermentation to a fixed-film reactor for the treatment of brewery wastewater</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h702q847f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rj430686h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):2350</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
