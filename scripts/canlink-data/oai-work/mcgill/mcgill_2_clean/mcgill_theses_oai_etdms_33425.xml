It begins with an introductory overview. Chapter 2 offers a general framework for analyzing complex economic and social environments. Specifically, I introduce new notions of a general system and a φ-stable set. By making use of Tarski's fixed point theorem, I then establish the existence of a φ-stable set. I further apply the proposed notions to game theory, e.g., rationalizability is derived from the largest φ-stable set. Chapter 3 establishes epistemic foundations for the criterion of "stability." Specifically, in strategic games, achieving common knowledge of rationality (CKR) implies an internally φ-stable set that is contained in an externally φ-stable set and, moreover, whenever mutually known, a φ-stable set is implied by rationality alone. In the case of two-person games, achieving CKR implies a φ-stable set. In extensive games with perfect information, achieving CKR implies a unique φ-stable set. On the other hand, in both strategic and extensive games, any of the commonly known φ-stable sets implies CKR. Furthermore, any φ-stable set can be achieved in terms of CKR. Chapter 4 presents a new solution concept of stable equilibrium in beliefs (SEB) by assuming it is common knowledge that players are uncertainty averse. By making use of an appealing criterion of "stability," an SEB is defined as a strategy profile supported by a stable belief system. It is shown that all SEBs constitute a unique stable belief system, and an SEB satisfies subgame perfectness; moreover, it is shown that the notion of SEB "refines" that of subgame perfect equilibrium in terms of path of play. Finally, we establish the epistemic foundation for the notion of SEB.</description><creator>Luo, Xiao, 1975-</creator><contributor>Greenberg, Joseph (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Game theory.</subject><title>Information, knowledge, and stability : essays in game theory</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8p58pf60v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ms35tb10n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Economics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g732db672</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:39:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation represents the first major examination of the depiction of the working class in the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) films between 1939 and 1946. It is also the first to focus on studying class as it relates to Canadian cinema. In search of the formative roots of the Board's early discourse on labour and the working class, we first look at the historical development of early Canadian cinematic culture, Canadian working class political and cultural discourse and the NFB's own political and working dynamics. We then examine the films and point out connections between their discourse and the views forwarded at the time by supporters of the Popular Front. The survey of the films is contextualized within three phases marking the rise, the solidification and the eventual descendance of this discourse. By the late 1930s, the policies of the Communist Party based Popular Front had already assumed a prominent position within Canadian working class politics. This thesis argues that, during a short period after its establishment, the NFB produced a body of film which introduced a new cinematic discourse on the role and the politics of labour and the working class. It concludes that this discourse was closely affected by the developments that influenced the rise and the decline of the counter-hegemonic movement that was instigated by the Popular Front.</description><creator>Khouri, Malek M.</creator><contributor>Szanto, George (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Working class in motion pictures.</subject><subject>National Film Board of Canada.</subject><title>The rise and fall of counter-hegemonic discourse on the working class : National Film Board of Canada films 1939-1946</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dz010r85b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g732db672</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Graduate Communications Program</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5138jg565</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:39:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This inquiry is about the sense-making of students in a technology education class as they build a prototype electric car in a secondary school manufacturing shop. I make sense of their sense-making by examining their talk and interaction in the interplay of the social, material, institutional, and organizational resources constituting what I call "distributed practice." This involves a move away from defining understanding and learning as self-contained structures in the minds of people, but instead sees learning as spread out in the broad social context of activity and participation. Distributed practice theorized in this way is about the interplay among "complex social relations, technologically constituted." Technologies and their use in practice provide us with a realm through which we can discuss issues related to the understanding of learners. In many respects, this dissertation is an exploration of how "the way things are done" becomes understanding and alternately, how understanding becomes "the way things are done." The analysis moves towards a social and cultural practice view of learning I call "practical negotiation."</description><creator>Kozolanka, Karne.</creator><contributor>Jackson, Nancy (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Active learning.</subject><subject>Technical education -- Social aspects.</subject><title>Distributed practice and practical negotiation in a tech ed classroom : the way things are done in technology education</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9p290c215.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5138jg565</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8g84mn97r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:39:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The goal of this thesis was to develop a framework that could integrate and analyse industry-wide information for the support of on-farm decision-making in dairy-cattle breeding. Specific objectives included (i) describing a dairy breeding information system (DBIS); (ii) examining how the Internet could be exploited to improve the DBIS and its functioning; (iii) describing a process for implementing a unified data model to facilitate integrated user access to information in the DBIS; and (iv) developing software to support decision-making by facilitating access to a unified data model when implemented as a database management software. The first objective was achieved by following a systems approach---defining a goal, boundary, functions, structure and performance---to describe multi-organisational information systems and, specifically, a DBIS in the Canadian dairy industry. Using this framework, the subsequent analysis of the DBIS looked at its overall effectiveness. The DBIS was also compared with other known systems, where the number of participants (as well as their roles) differs from the Canadian situation. Improvements were suggested for the Canadian DBIS by focussing on the decision-maker's ability to retrieve, integrate and consider required information through information technologies. The second objective involved using the systems approach to investigate the kinds of information (if any) provided on Web sites of the DBIS participants, and to see if the Internet could be exploited to improve this process, either in terms of improved transfer speed or data transformation. It was established that the Internet is being used for rapid, flexible access to support information by DBIS participants, but that it is being under-utilised, particularly where herd output information is concerned. Herd output information could be filtered, integrated and transformed to support specific user needs at appropriate levels of intelligence density. It was further postulated that these data could be exploited more effectively through the use of such information technologies as common data exchange mechanisms and decision-support systems. The third objective was achieved through applying information engineering methods to develop a data model to represent the DBIS. This unified model was described in conceptual, logical and physical terms, and facilitated transparent access for on-farm users to information from more than one source organisation. It was demonstrated that such a model could maintain the autonomy of participating organisations while simultaneously creating an amalgamated databank for decision support. The final objective lead to the
development of a prototype user interface called DAIRIE: DAiry Information Retrieval and
Integration Expert which could interact with the physical schema ofthe unified data model
previously developed. The interface consisted of data selection, aggregation and display
forms, and allowed dynamic SQL query generation for transparent infonnation retrieval to
support decision-making. Knowledge was employed in facilitating user access to
information as weil as its presentation and interpretation. The approach is modular and,
therefore, flexible in tenns offuture additions and improvements. The prototype shows that
there is potential for creating data driven systems that cao satisfy individual uses and
preferences for herd output information.</description><creator>Archer, Alfred Ainsley.</creator><contributor>Wade, K. M.

This issue is of critical importance because the corporate reputation of a firm is one of its most valuable but potentially volatile intangible resources. Therefore, a better understanding of the situations where business firms suffer significant reputational losses within relatively short periods of time can contribute to both strategic management and business and society. From a strategic management perspective, the examination of sudden major losses in corporate reputation is an examination of the loss of what is potentially one of the most important intangible firm resources, if not the most important intangible resource of the firm. While, from a business and society perspective, an examination of sudden drops in corporate reputation could reveal the reputational impact that such sudden events have in the network of stakeholders (Freeman, 1984) who surround the firm and are, in a sense, the 'evaluators' of its reputation. The first paper of this dissertation consists of a theoretical exploration of the management of reputational crises caused by sudden and unexpected incidents like industrial accidents, scandals, and product failures. Drawing on the stakeholder and crisis management literatures, a model useful in providing a better understanding of reputational crises is developed. The second paper is an empirical investigation into the impact that accidents can have on the corporate reputation of business firms. More specifically the impact that a number of accident characteristics have on the reputational re-evaluations of two particular stakeholder groups, industry executives and financial analysts, is investigated with data drawn from Lexis-Nexis and the America's Most Admired Corporations (AMAC) survey of FORTUNE magazine. Finally, the third paper of the dissertation examines the Brent Spar controversy to investigate two issues of importance in the management of reputational crises: the reasons behind a company's decisions to buffer or bridge when faced with a reputational crisis; and, the role of stakeholder salience in this decision.</description><creator>Zyglidopoulos, Stylianos.</creator><contributor>Phillips, Nelson (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Corporate image -- Case studies.</subject><subject>Corporate image.</subject><title>Three essays on reputational crises</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m900nw325.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x920fz38q</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Management</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qn59q575h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:39:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Small cavities, called micropores, are common defects found in aluminum castings. Mathematical modeling of microporosity is difficult due to a lack of chemical parameters and a limited understanding of the mechanisms of pore formation and development. The objective of the present work is to obtain a better understanding of the nucleation and growth of microporosity in Al-7%Si (A356) foundry alloy. This consisted of the measurement of the surface tension of A356 alloy, a study of the factors that affect the final amount of porosity in castings, and the measurement of the evolution of porosity during solidification. The measurement of the surface tension of pure aluminum and A356 alloy was performed under vacuum and hydrogen atmospheres. The surface tension of A356 alloy under vacuum at 630°C was 0.889 N/m. The addition of hydrogen did not significantly alter this value. The addition of strontium decreased the surface tension by about 5%. It was concluded that the effect of strontium on the surface tension was not the cause of the increase in porosity observed in strontium modified castings. The effects of hydrogen content, local solidification time and strontium modification on microporosity were studied. Two critical fraction solids were associated with the formation of microporosity. The first, the critical fraction solid for pore growth, is the point at which preexisting baseline porosity begins to grow due to hydrogen evolution. It varied with hydrogen content and strontium modification. The second, the critical fraction solid for nucleation, is the point at which shrinkage type porosity nucleates. It did not vary with hydrogen content or strontium modification, and remained constant at approximately 75--80% solid. The measurement of microporosity was performed using image analysis. A new method for filtering and sorting the data, based on nearest neighbor cluster analysis, was developed. A mathematical model based on the current experimental results was created. The model is capable of predicting the evolution of the percentage porosity during solidification, the final percentage porosity and the maximum pore size.</description><creator>Anson, James Philip.</creator><contributor>Gavzleski, John (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Drew, Robin (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Engineering, Materials Science.</subject><title>The nucleation and growth of microporosity in aluminum - 7% silicon foundry alloy /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k35696105.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qn59q575h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:br86b498f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:39:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In trying to solve nonlinear partial differential equations with time dependence using the Galerkin method, one ends up with solving nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations, which are not easily solved. In this thesis we introduce a new iterative method based on eigenfunction expansion to deal with the finite non-linear systems sequentially. We apply the new method to integrate the semi-linear parabolic equation ut=12u+fu ,x∈D with homogeneous Dirichlet or Robin boundary conditions. We prove the convergence of the new iterative method, and use it to find the multiple solutions of the system, which are difficult to obtain using the Galerkin method. We next apply the new method to solve a parabolic system of two semi-linear equations  ut=12u+f u,q qt=12 q+gu,q ,x∈D with homogeneous boundary conditions Au = 0 and Bv = 0. We prove the convergence of the new method for the case when A = B. If A ≠ B no analytical statements are obtained. However, the proof of convergence is a sufficient, but not a necessary condition, and numerical calculations indicate that the solution obtained by the new method still converges to that obtained by the Galerkin method for the case when A ≠ B. We apply the new method to integrate a system in combustion theory, and we are able to find critical (as defined in Chapter 4) solutions for the system, which are not easily found using the Galerkin method. To see that the new method can be applied to more general systems, we use it to integrate the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation  6tu+41+e 264xu+e6 2xu+12 6xu2=0 ,x∈0,ℓ We prove the convergence of the iterative method and use it to find the first term of the eigenfunction expansion analytically, and from that we notice that the equation has two solutions, one stable and the other unstable. This kind of observation can not be obtained using the Galerkin method. Finally, we apply the new method to solve a wave type equation governing the motion of a fluid in a conveying pipe,  EI64w 6x4+(MU2 t+M6U6t L-x)6 2w6x2+2MU6 2w6x6t+M +m62w 6t2=0. In all of the above systems, numerical calculations indicate that the solutions obtained by the new method and the Galerkin method coincide.</description><creator>Al Refai, Mohammed.</creator><contributor>Tam, K.

Unlike this model, a recently developed two-compartment CBF model accounts for nonextracted intravascular radioactivity and therefore provides with perfusion (CBF) as well as vascular, i.e., blood volume (CBV) related, information. The two parameters obtained from this two-compartment analysis, namely cerebral water clearance, KH2O1 , a measure of perfusion, and the apparent tracer distribution volume, Vo, provide more complete haemodynamic information than CBF alone. Still, accurate K1 values can only be obtained if appropriate corrections for tracer delay (Deltat) and dispersion (tau) have been applied. Building on this two-compartment model, we have derived new nonlinear and linear solutions where all parameters involved appear explicitly. Simulations were performed to evaluate the accuracy and precision with which K1, k2, Vo, Deltat and tau can be determined from multiparameter regression of the model equations on dynamic PET data. It was found that K1 and k2 can be estimated with less than 2% error using 5-parameter fitting. We have applied our solutions to dynamic 15O-water bolus PET studies where a CBF change was produced either through neuronal activation triggered by visual stimulation (in normal subjects), or by external pharmacological control through vasodilatory insults induced by Diamox injection (in patients with cerebrovascular disease) and antioxidant LY231617 administration (in monkeys with unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion). We found that in addition to accurate pixel-by-pixel estimation of K 1 and k2, accurate changes in K1, Vo and the ratio Vo/K1 between baseline and activation states can also be obtained using our solutions of the two-compartment CBF model with implicit corrections for delay, dispersion and residual vascular radioactivity. These parameter changes provide potential indices of cerebrovascular reserve capacity, and of variations in cerebral vascular volume and mean vascular transit time. Our method may prove to be an elegant tool in the selection of candidates for revascularisation surgery.</description><creator>Toussaint, Paule-Joanne.</creator><contributor>Meyer, Ernst (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Thompson, Christopher J.

RMR involves the discrimination of one of two possible rhythms, despite perceptual masking of the rhythm by an irregular sequence of sounds identical to the rhythmic sounds that are interleaved among them. The rhythm can be released from masking by inducing the perceptual fusion of the irregular interfering sounds with concurrent "flanking" sounds situated in different frequency regions. The accuracy of the identified rhythm and its rated clarity in a two-alternative forced-choice procedure measured the degree of cross-spectral fusion of the interfering sounds with the flanking sounds. The results obtained in six experiments suggest that temporal synchrony is sufficient for the fusion of (i) brief noise bursts that are widely apart in frequency (large DeltaF), that have uncorrelated high-rate intensity changes (HRIC), and that are spatially separated; and (ii) brief tones that are not harmonics of a common fundamental frequency (F0) and that are spatially-separated. An asynchrony of 20--40 ms is sufficient for the segregation of: (i) brief temporally-overlapping noise bursts with correlated HRIC and without spatial separations; and (ii) brief overlapping tones sharing a common F0 and without spatial separations. Intermediate asynchronies of 10--20 ms produce ambiguous cases of grouping and the presence of other segregation or fusion cues is critical to disambiguate them. Thus, whereas uncorrelated ERIC, large DeltaF's, different F0's, and dichotic presentation all significantly affect the fusion of simultaneous or nearly simultaneous sounds, they are not sufficient by themselves to fully segregate these sounds; however, when a group of them act together, their synergetic action reinforces the effect of a small asynchrony in promoting segregation. When two sources are simultaneously active and emit short-duration sounds, separation of the sound sources in space has a negligible effect on their segregation. This research demonstrates the dominance of spectro-temporal cues (e.g., temporal synchrony) over spatial cues (e.g., common sound-source location) for the grouping of brief concurrent sounds. It also demonstrates that the auditory system is highly sensitive to any deviation from temporal synchrony. Further research is needed to establish whether the present conclusions apply to sounds of a longer duration.</description><creator>Turgeon, Martine.</creator><contributor>Bregman, Albert S.

The study mainly consists of an analysis of different strategies used by certain progressive artists like Paul-Emile Borduas, Francoise Sullivan and Jean-Paul Riopelle to impose a new reality which was simultaneously contemporary, rooted and distinct in the context of a Quebec that was emerging in modernization. By using popular or marginalized artistic forms and by seizing certain ancient models belonging to the distant past---in the non-western world or precolonial America---and by using different strategies of deconstruction and transgression of normative codes defined by the dominant ideology, these artists were able to avoid current hegemonic models in order to assert new spaces for expression and representation. Taking on modern Quebecois art from an approach belonging to diverse social sciences and humanities, this study aims to renew the analytical parameters of the traditional art history. The main challenge lies in zeroing in on the ways in which the development of modern identity (meaning the affirmation of the right to be different and to self-determination, and the development of subjectivism and expressivism) influenced avant-garde artistic productions, and which strategies artists used to replace the values imposed by traditional institutions and the dominant ideology, which in turn sparked a renewal of identity. Modern identity is based upon a principle that is modeled on two foundations: on the image that the subject will have of himself, and the impression that the Other (a bordering neighbour, cultural cousin, colonial authority or political oppressor) will have of him. In fact, this "stranger" will essentially assume the role of guaranteeing the recognition of the proposed identity.

This model requires accurate estimates of Hg elimination rate by fish and feeding rates to adequately predict Hg concentration in fish. An empirical model was developed to estimate Hg elimination by fish using data obtained from published experiments. This analysis showed that Hg elimination rate was overestimated in short-term experiments, positively correlated to water temperature, negatively correlated to body size, and that the elimination rate of inorganic Hg was faster than that of methylmercury. This empirical model was then incorporated in a Hg mass balance model to predict the concentration of Hg in fish. The Hg mass balance model accurately predicted Hg concentration in fish when it was combined with food consumption rates that were determined using a radioisotopic method. This analysis suggested that the parameters of the Hg mass balance model were adequate for predicting Hg concentration in fish. I also showed that Hg concentration tended to be underestimated by the Hg mass balance model when it was combined with feeding rates determined with a laboratory-derived bioenergetic model, probably because activity costs derived in the laboratory do not reflect activity costs of fish in the field. Beside predicting Hg concentration in fish, I showed that this mass balance model could also be used to estimate feeding rates of fish in the field by measuring the concentration of Hg in fish. This approach was validated using data obtained from a published experiment. It was also successfully tested using independent estimates of feeding rates obtained with a radioisotopic method. I applied this Hg mass balance model to compare the energy budget of sympatric populations of dwarf and normal whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis). This analysis showed that dwarf whitefish consumed 40--50% more food than normal whitefi</description><creator>Trudel, Marc.</creator><contributor>Rasmussen, J. B.

The nucleosome assembly protein 2 (NAP-2) was previously identified by positional cloning at 11p15.5, a region implicated in several disease processes including Wilms tumor (WT) etiology. The deduced amino acid sequence of NAP-2 indicates that it encodes a protein with a potential nuclear localization motif and two clusters of highly acidic residues. Recombinant NAP-2 can transfer histories onto DNA templates. Deletion mutagenesis of NAP-2 demonstrates that both NH3- and COOH-terminal are required for histories transfer activity. Subcellular localization studies of NAP-2 indicate that it can shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, suggesting a role as histone chaperone. Given the potential role of NAP-2 gene in WT etiology, we have elucidated the exon/intron structure of this gene and have analyzed the mutational status of NAP-2 in sporadic WT. Our results, coupled with tumor suppression assays in G401 WT cells, do not support a role for NAP-2 in the etiology of WT. CKII, from HeLa cell nuclear extracts, interacts with immobilized NAP-2 and phosphorylates both NAP-2 and nucleosome assembly protein 1 (NAP-1) in vitro. Furthermore, NAP-1 and NAP-2 phosphorylation in crude HeLa cell extracts is abolished by heparin, a specific inhibitor of CKII. Addition of core histories can stimulate phosphorylation of NAP-1 and NAP-2 by CKII. NAP-2 is also a phosphoprotein in vivo. The protein is phosphorylated at the G0/G1 boundary, but in S-phase it is not phosphorylated. Here, we showed that NAP-2 is a histone chaperone throughout the cell cycle and that its cell-cycle distribution might be governed by its phosphorylation status. Phosphorylated NAP-2 remains in the cytoplasm in a complex with histories during the G0/G1 transition, whereas its dephosphorylation triggers its transport into the nucleus, at the G1/S-boundary, with the histone cargo, suggesting that binding to histones does not depend on its phosphorylation status. Finally, indirect immunofluorescence shows that NAP-2 is present during metaphase of HeLa and COS cells, and its localization is distinct from metaphase chromosomes. By cross-linking studies in vitro, using whole cell extracts we found, that NAP-2 specifically cross-reacted with proteins of an apparent molecular weight of 100 and 175 kDa. Furthermore, in sucrose gradients of HeLa cell nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts, NAP-2 migrated at higher molecular weights (158 to 500 kDa or more), than expected for a protein of 42 kDa. NAP-2 migrates in a native polyacrylamide gel at an apparent molecular weight of 300 kDa. In vivo-labeled NAP-2 from HeLa cells co-precipitated with other proteins, migrating as 100 kDa and 175 kDa. NAP-2 from total HeLa cell extract co-purified with other proteins throughout two chromatographic steps. A positively charged resin, Q-Sepharose, was used to co-purify NAP-2 with other proteins, which eluted in a single peak at 0.5 M NaCl. This fraction possesses both relaxing and supercoiling activities and it assembles regularly spaced nucleosomes onto naked DNA in an ATP-dependent manner. Addition of either plasmid DNA or core histones stimulate cross-linking of NAP-2 into different complexes. A negatively charged resin (heparin) retained small amounts of NAP-2 (a very acidic polypeptide) and topoisomerase I. This fraction was also able to supercoil relaxed DNA, but to a lesser extent than the Q-Sepharose fraction. The data suggest that NAP-2 is in complex with other proteins, distinct from histories.</description><creator>Rodriguez Collazo, Pedro.</creator><contributor>Zannis-Hadjopoulos, Maria (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Functional characterization of a new human nucleosome assembly protein (NAP-2) suggests a role as a histone chaperone</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mc87ps079.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c247dt750</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:76537282p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:39:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The main objective of this research was to create a finite element model for detailed three-dimensional stress analysis of an overhead optical ground wire (OPGW) typical of those used in transmission lines. The detailed model considers all possible mechanical effects, such as contact, friction, elongation, torsion, and bending for different end conditions. The OPGW under study comprises four components: the external layer of fourteen aluminum alloy wires and ten inner aluminum clad steel wires, which are laid over an aluminum tube that houses a five-groove aluminum spacer. The optical fiber units are inserted in the aluminum spacer grooves. Three-dimensional solid elements are used to model the outer wires, the inner wires, and the aluminum spacer. The central aluminum tube is modeled with shell elements with large strain and deformation kinematics. All possible contacts between the components, with and without friction, are considered in the model. The OPGW is assumed fixed at one end and pulled from the other with a prescribed displacement equivalent to the experimental elongation of 0.61% defined for all components. The finite element analysis predicts that the responses of the outer and inner wires are in the linear range, however the aluminum tube and spacer are yielded under the prescribed displacement. Therefore, a multilinear stress-strain law is used in the model. Two scenarios of loading were tested to apply the axial elongation on the wires; either only the central node or all the interior nodes of the wire cross sections are prescribed a maximum axial displacement. Results of the finite element model are compared with those of the experiments performed at IREQ and with the analytical solutions of Machida and Durelli (1973) and Phillips and Costello (1973). The calculated axial forces of the cable in the coarse and fine mesh models are 61% and 70% of those predicted by the analytical solutions, respectively. However, the differences in stresses and strains of the coarse mesh model are in the range of ten percent only from the theoretical solutions. The effective modulus of elasticity of the finite element model increases with tension. For the maximum elongation, the effective modulus obtained with the coarse and fine mesh models is 62% and 70% respectively of the equivalent modulus of elasticity calculated neglecting all three-dimensional effects. This study shows the reliability and significance of using finite element modeling in predicting the detailed response of a complex cable, for which experiments and theoretical solutions are unable to yield complete results.

Heterochromatin has been involved in processes, such as position-effect variegation (PEV), that disrupt normal expression of euchromatic genes. The role of highly repetitive DNA sequences, also termed satellite DNAs, in gene silencing has therefore aroused a great deal of interest. Previous plasmid transfection studies into tk-/neo- human cells had shown that the location (in cis) of a 1.797 kb human satellite II DNA sequence next to the 5' end of the neo gene, exerted a severe negative effect on the recovery of stable tk+/neo + transfectants, in the presence of HAT and G418 drugs. As shown in this thesis, positioning of the same satellite II DNA sequence at another location, between the 3' ends of the tk and neo genes, led to the loss of this negative effect. To identify a possible size limit to the silencing effect exerted by the satellite II DNA, fragments of 813 and 983 by of the 1.797 kb DNA sequence were also inserted near the 5' end of the neo gene. These sequences were still able to exert a drastic negative effect on the recovery of stable tk+/neo + transfectants. The effect was found to be dependent on the orientation of the satellite II DNA fragments relative to the marker genes. Further reduction in the size of the satellite II DNA sequence, to fragments of 354 to 620 bp, revealed a significant reduction in the negative effect. Selection of the transfected cells in media containing single drugs (i.e. HAT or G418) showed that the neo gene in the plasmids was more affected than the tk gene. Analysis of the integration pattern of the plasmid vector and a plasmid containing the 1.797 kb satellite II DNA indicated that the satellite II DNA did not influence the plasmid site of integration.</description><creator>Saint-Dic, Djenann.</creator><contributor>DuBow, Michael S.

Forty same-sex groups of four children from kindergarten and grade four were observed during sessions in which groups played first with two different toys and then two different games. The toy and game sessions were constructed so children had to negotiate for a scarce resource (attractive toy and game winner's certificate). In the case of one of the toys the end of a player's turn was obvious to group members (explicit turn-taking toy), in the case of the other toy the end of a turn was not obvious to group members (nonexplicit turn-taking toy). Resource use (time with toy), group variability in resource use, positive affect and self-report measures were collected. Results of the toy sessions revealed both genders were very similar on all the measures; however, girls were significantly more likely to have greater group variance in distributing the nonexplicit turn-taking toy. The two games, one competitive and one noncompetitive, involved players trying to reach a finish line. For the competitive game, only one player could win, but for the noncompetitive game all players could win. During both games, a player could potentially interfere with another player's goal to win. Resource use (interfering), group variability in resource use, positive affect and self-report measures were collected. Results of the game sessions revealed both genders were very similar on all measures, however, during the competitive game, girls were more likely to have greater group variance in interfering. The results are discussed in terms of considering aspects of the context when investigating gender differences in competition.</description><creator>Roy, Rosanne.</creator><contributor>Benenson, Joyce F.

Although there is a substantial amount of the literature on this subject, these studies have unfortunately an inadequate characterization of the way in which indigenous people view, order, internalize, and manipulate environmental information. This deficiency indicates a need to (a) improve our understanding and use of indigenous knowledge as an instrument for sustainable development and resource management and (b) revise some of our present conceptual, theoretical, and methodological understandings. This dissertation examines these issues by investigating the ecological knowledge of the Barriere Lake Algonquins, living largely within Park La Verendrye in northwestern Quebec. The scope of this study concentrates on three aspects of this indigenous knowledge, namely, the (1) cyclicality within, the (2) utilization of, and the (3) terminology for the Algonquin forest environment. Theoretically, I draw to some extent on an approach taken from cognitive science called "connectionism" which helps integrate ecology and cognition. Within this theoretical framework I examine the experiences and understandings that different individuals and groups bring to common every-day situations involving environmental resources. Three principles are put forward from the empirical findings of this thesis. First, indigenous knowledge formation is a contextual and experientially driven process rather than a static and timeless content. This process involves the natural-material and socio-cultural environment, expanding the typical cognitive unit of analysis beyond the individual person to include his or her entire natural and social surroundings. Second, this contextual and experientially driven process gives rise to heterogeneous, fluid, and contested knowledges. The knowledge-formation process goes beyond the mere generation and transmission of knowledge to how knowledge is articulated and used in particular everyday situations. Third, this process-approach has important implications which, if ignored, will prevent researchers from developing an adequate understanding and appreciation of the contextual nature of IK because the research will fail to consider the everyday experiences which become internalized, shared, and later put to use. The process-approach has important practical, theoretical, and methodological implications for IK and its use in development, resource management, and resource conservation.</description><creator>Nickels, Scot, 1959-</creator><contributor>Wenzel, George (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Ethnobiology -- Québec (Province) -- Lac-Barrière Region.</subject><subject>Forest ecology -- Québec (Province) -- Lac-Barrière Region.</subject><subject>Algonquin Indians -- Ethnobiology -- Québec (Province) -- Lac-Barrière Region.</subject><title>Importance of experiential context for understanding indigenous ecological knowledge : the Algonquins of Barriere Lake, Quebec</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c534fq59v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6w924d41m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kw52j964b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:39:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In the N2 fixing legume symbiosis, mineral nitrogen (N) not only decreases N2 fixation, but also delays and inhibits the formation and development of nodules. The purposes of this thesis were to elucidate the role of signaling in the mineral N effects on nodulation and nitrogen fixation in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and to attempt to find ways to overcome this inhibition. The responses of soybean plants, in terms of daidzein and genistein synthesis and exudation, to different mineral N levels were studied. Daidzein and genistein distribution patterns varied with plant organs, mineral N levels, and plant development stages. Mineral N inhibited daidzein and genistein contents and concentrations in soybean root and shoot extracts, but did not affect root daidzein and genistein excretion in the same way. In both synthesis and excretion, daidzein and genistein were not affected equally by mineral N treatments. Variability existed among soybean cultivars in the responses of root daidzein and genistein contents and concentrations to mineral N levels. The amount of daidzein and genistein excreted by soybean roots did not always correspond to the daidzein and genistein contents and concentrations inside the roots. On the Bradyrhizobium japonicum side, nod gene expression was inhibited by mineral nitrogen. Genistein was used to pre-incubate B. japonicum cells or was applied directly into the plant growing medium. The results showed that genistein manipulation increased nodule weight and nodule nitrogen fixation under greenhouse conditions, but interactions existed among soybean cultivars, genistein concentrations and nitrate levels. Similar results were found under field conditions. Soybean yield was increased on sandy-loam soil by preincubation of B. japonicum cells with genistein. Addition of genistein beginning at the onset of nitrogen fixation also improved soybean nodulation and nitrogen fixation. Soybean cultivars had different sensitivities to genistein additi Other studies also show that temperature affected genistein and daidzein content and concentration in soybean roots. The effect of temperature varied among soybean cultivars. Some PGPR strains can mitigate the negative effects of nitrate on soybean nodulation and nitrogen fixation, however, this is influenced by soybean genotype. Applying PGPR together with genistein preincubation of B. japonicum cells improved soybean nodulation and increased yield. The level of improvement varied among soybean cultivars and PGPR strains. Preincubation of B. japonicum cells with genistein improved strain competitiveness under greenhouse, but not field conditions. Overall, these findings suggested that both plant-to-Bradyrhizobium and Bradyrhizobium-to-plant signals play important roles in the effects of mineral N on nodulation and N fixation. Signal manipulation could partially overcome the inhibitory effects of mineral N on soybean- B. japonicum N fixation symbiosis.</description><creator>Pan, Bo, 1963-</creator><contributor>Smith, D. L.

Al-Iṣlaḥ is on one level an early example of Neoplatonist influence on Isma`ili thought, taking the form of a polemic aimed at his coreligionist, Muḥammad al-Nasafi. However, al-Iṣlaḥ also shows a new doctrinal formulation of early Isma`ili discourse on prophetology, especially concerning the messianic figure of the Qa'im. In al-Iṣlaḥ al-Razi discusses the missions of each of the enunciator-prophets (nuṭaqa' ) using the terminology of Greek-Hellenistic sciences, thereby implying that the Qa'im possesses a rank higher than any other prophet. In addition, whereas he appears to assign the Qa'im's political role to the leaders of the Isma`ili community in the present age, al-Razi describes a new era to be inaugurated by the figure, constituting a purified version of this world. In this way the figure of the Qa'im is depoliticized and spiritualized. It is thus suggested that al-Razi's thought on prophecy in al-Iṣlaḥ, while theorizing the place of the Qa'im in sacred history, represents a response to the crisis in his own time engendered by the postponement of the Qa'im's final advent and victory.</description><creator>Nomoto, Shin.</creator><contributor>Landolt, Hermann (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Ismailites -- Doctrines.</subject><subject>Prophecy.</subject><subject>Abū Ḥātim al-Rāzī, Aḥmad ibn Ḥamdān, d. 934?

It specifically considers the role of small Catholic non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in these communities. With the idea that the process of economic and human development is never a politically neutral, technological procedure, but a process of social change, it discusses the role of discourse. The thesis considers the factors that influence how these small NGOs view themselves and their role in the community and choose what projects to initiate. It finds that these NGOs employ a specifically religious idiom of development that sets them apart from other kinds of development organizations in the ways in which they define their mission and in the types of projects they are willing to consider. Based on the author's field research in Kolla and Wichi communities, the study also considers local response to the NGOs and how local people view "development" for themselves and their communities. In order to explore these issues, the process of land claims in each community is considered in depth. Land ownership is seen by the NGOs and the communities themselves as a critical component of locally-empowered development. The ways in which these indigenous communities understand their relationship to the land which they occupy is explored. This relationship tends to be accentuated in land claims cases.</description><creator>Occhipinti, Laurie.</creator><contributor>Attwood, Donald (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Bossen, Laurel (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Non-governmental organizations -- Argentina.</subject><subject>Religious institutions -- Argentina.</subject><subject>Economic development -- Argentina.</subject><title>Global visions, local voices : economic development and religious organizations in two indigenous communities in Argentina</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/np193b60d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xw42n962j</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anthropology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gm80hx117</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:39:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In an effort to explore various difficulties in the process of reemployment, the focus of this study is how, to what extent, and in what way length of unemployment duration is generated by the interplay between the structural characteristics of the labor market and the individual characteristics of unemployed workers. The structural resources are conceptualized in terms of (1) different types of reemployment, and (2) economic sectors. It turns out that the insertion of labor market structures into research on unemployment duration is quite valuable in improving our understanding of individual reemployment behavior. The findings show that reemployment through job recalls is relatively easier than through job switches. Even though many unemployed workers remained to benefit from the structural buffer of internal labor markets in their struggle for reemployment, workers losing core-sector jobs are found to have more difficulty in switching to a new job relative to those losing peripheral jobs. The finding illustrates a critical weakness of internal labor markets in reallocating unemployed workers. Furthermore, the impact of the labor market location of lost jobs is also observed in both the manner and the extent to which the individual attributes of unemployed workers affect the process of reemployment. (1) More education substantially improves the reemployment chances of workers losing core-services jobs, but not workers unemployed from other sectors. (2) The reemployment probability of workers losing core-services jobs is increased with an improvement in general education whereas the reemployment probabilities of workers losing core goods-production jobs tend to increase with an accumulation in firm-specific skills. (3) Men tend to maintain their reemployment advantage through their access to internal labor markets whereas women improve their reemployment probability by benefiting from job expansion in service industries. (4) Experienced core-service workers tend to have a shorter unemployment duration than young ones when their jobs are available for recall, whereas experienced peripheral goods production workers often have a competitive disadvantage in switching to a new job. And (5) UI benefits slow down the job-recall rate substantially but have little impact on the individual behavior of searching for a new job. The problem of timing termination of unemployment duration to coincide with exhaustion of UI benefits is much more severe for the job-recall rate than for the job-switch rate.</description><creator>Lou, Zhijian, 1957-</creator><contributor>Smith, Michael (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Job vacancies -- Canada.</subject><subject>Unemployment -- Canada.</subject><subject>Employment (Economic theory)</subject><subject>Unemployed -- Canada.</subject><title>Determination of unemployment duration in Canada</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ms35tb126.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gm80hx117</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Sociology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p2676x418</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:39:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>New Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) approaches for the quantitative determination of peroxide value (PV) and isolated trans analyses were investigated and developed. The FTIR-PV methods investigated were all based on the stoichiometric reaction of hydroperoxides and triphenylphosphine (TPP) which converts TPP to triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO). A reference transmission cell (100 mum) method was developed based on the use of a unique TPPO absorption at 542 cm-1. This method covered PV values from 0--15 PV and was shown to be superior in accuracy and reproducibility to the standard American Oil Chemists Society (AOCS) iodometric method. Subsequently, the utility of disposable polyethylene cards, normally used only for qualitative analyses, was investigated for quantitative PV determination. A quantitative IR card method was successfully developed and shown to serve as a very simple, rapid and alternative means of carrying out PV analyses. TPP-impregnated cards were able to reproduce the transmission cell PV results to +/-1.12 PV, while the unimpregnated card was slightly more accurate (+/-0.92 PV). A third FTIR-PV method was developed specifically for the at-line monitoring of high PV fatliquors and employed a germanium attenuated total reflectance sample handling accessory. This method hinged on the use of a TPPO absorption band at 1118 cm-1, normally off scale when pathlengths of &gt;3 mum are used, but is suited to the analysis of oils having very high PVs (&gt;250). The successful quantitative use of the disposable polyethylene IR card to PV led to its study for the quantitative FTIR determination of the isolated trans content of fats and oils and margarines. The polyethylene card was shown to unique and useful properties, tending to inhibit fat crystallization and its inability to retain moisture. These two properties allowed trans determination to be carried out on melted, high trans fats, without heating the polyethylene substrate and also to analyze margarines</description><creator>Ma, Kangming, 1965-</creator><contributor>van de Voort, F.

Most important among these works are three books of Cantiones Sacrae, published 1575, 1589 and 1591, respectively. The 1589 Cantiones Sacrae was Byrd's first harvest from a backlog of motets that had been accumulating since 1575. This collection lies at a midpoint between Byrd's earliest published works and his full maturity, as seen in the Masses of 1592--95. This study will describe the contrapuntal strategies that characterize Byrd's 1589 Cantiones. I will examine Byrd's deeper-level tonal organization and its derivation from cantus firmus technique. I will show how Byrd uses musical material in cantus firmus values (the breve and semibreve) to shape his subject material and his cadence points, and how this shaping plays out over the course of an imitative point. I will then examine Byrd's introductory gestures in the 1589 Cantiones, identifying 24 presentation types that characterize different degrees of beginning. These types contain one or more melodic subjects in a recurring temporal relationship, and form a vertical interval pattern or harmonic motive. Next, I will discuss Byrd's variation techniques by which he develops these presentation types: textural change, transposition, melodic inversion and invertible counterpoint. Byrd's presentation and variation of subject material divides an imitative point into distinct phases of tonal and contrapuntal activity, providing insight into its overall form and tonal design. Finally, I will apply these analytical tools to a complete analysis of Tristitia et anxietas, from the 1589 Cantiones, thereby showing how Byrd establishes central pitches in the middleground. Through this analysis, I will summarize Byrd's contrapuntal strategies, both long-range and local, that typify his middle-period sacred vocal style, as viewed through the lens of the 1589 Cantiones Sacrae.</description><creator>Mackay, James S.</creator><contributor>Schubert, Peter (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Motets -- Analysis, appreciation.</subject><subject>Byrd, William, 1542 or 3-1623.

Cyclic phosphoramidite 3-34 derived from 3-32 is a useful precursor for the stereoselective synthesis of phosphorothioate. The chiral auxiliary can be easily removed at the end of the synthesis by treatment with concentrated ammonia. The major dithymidine phosphorothioate isomer with a SP configuration was obtained. The allyl group was investigated as a protecting group for the internucleotide linkage. The removal of the allyl group in dimer 4-6S or 4-6O was achieved by treatment with nucleophiles. Solid phase study indicated this to be a general method for the routine solid phase synthesis of oligonucleotide phosphorothioates and phosphates.* A new type of chiral auxiliary 5-20 which incorporates indole and imidazole moieties was synthesized. It led to the stereoselective synthesis of a novel indolophosphorothioate 5-37 with 90% de and the formation of an alkylphosphinate analog 5-41 as a single diastereomer. Chiral indolo-oxazaphosphorine 6-22 was prepared from L-tryptophan. Dithymidine phosphorothioate with ≥95% de was obtained while using 6-22 as a precursor. The removal of the chiral auxiliary was achieved by heating in concentrated ammonia at 55ºC for 16 hours. The indolo-oxazaphosphorines derived from L- or D-tryptophans led to the formations of dithymidine phosphorothioates with RP or SP configurations, respectively. The methodology was applied successfully to the solid phase synthesis of phosphorothioate dimers.* *Please refer to dissertation for diagrams.</description><creator>Lu, Yixin, 1970-</creator><contributor>Just, George (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Chemistry, Organic.</subject><title>Towards the stereoselective synthesis of oligonucleotide phosphorothioates and phosphonate derivatives</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3484zj457.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qj72p8793</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:tm70mx110</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:39:14Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The early Christian text known as the 'Letter to the Hebrews' has presented a riddle to scholarship. Its anonymity and anomalous form are puzzling. Scholars like Norman Perrin and Barnabas Lindars also-find Hebrews enigmatic because it does not appear to represent the views of any early Christian community. This thesis contends that the riddle of Hebrews' lack of community-fit is due to a conceptual flaw. Beginning with Franz Overbeck (1882), there has been a tendency to assess early Christian texts as nonliterary, unlike later Patristic texts. Deemed nonliterary, they are thereby thought to document the situation within which they were written. For Hebrews, this has resulted in numerous reconstructions of its historical setting. None, however, has proven satisfactory. This lack of consensus casts doubt on the appropriateness of ruling out Hebrews' essential literary character. Moreover, the explanations used to justify the unique nonliterary character of early Christian literature are not compelling. Thus, the probability of Hebrews' literary character increases. The literary texts written by Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, and Tertullian, are more likely comparable to Hebrews. These Patristic texts were produced in the late second century before the shape of orthodoxy became fixed. A survey of representative scholarly literature shows a low expectation of retrieving from these early Patristic texts an unambiguous profile of the author's ideological community, of the text's occasion, or of its audience. Thus, it would be unwarranted to expect Hebrews to be more representative of its situation. Given the probability of Hebrews' literary character, the thesis demonstrates that it is inappropriate to assume that Hebrews represents ideas that extend beyond those of the author to a specific community or to a particular situation. The burden of proof is reversed. Without evidence to the contrary, Hebrews is best explained as a persuasive literary effort by an idiosyncratic author directed to a general Christian audience. Thus, the riddle of Hebrews' lack of community-fit dissolves. Furthermore, questions are raised regarding the contemporary scholarly expectation that other early Christian writings (Matthew, James, etc.) were shaped by and for ideologically distinct communities.</description><creator>Isaak, Jonathan M.</creator><contributor>Wisse, Frederik (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Church history -- Primitive and early church, ca. 30-600.</subject><title>Situating the 'Letter to the Hebrews' in early Christian history</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sj1393708.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tm70mx110</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Religious Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cv43nz87v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:39:14Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Protein-protein and ligand-protein interactions as well as the effect of temperature and applied pressure on protein conformation were investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with the use of Fourier self-deconvolution, Fourier derivative, and two-dimensional correlation techniques. The effect of the binding of biotin to avidin on the conformation of the protein was examined. At a biotin concentration of 0.05% (w/v), avidin was stabilized against thermal and pressure-induced denaturation. The IR spectra of avidin recorded as a function of increasing hydrostatic pressure in the presence and the absence of biotin indicated that, in the presence of biotin, avidin adopts a very compact structure in solution. The 2D correlation analysis of the infrared spectra of avidin recorded as a function of increasing temperature over the range of 25--95°C revealed that the protein unfolded via different pathways in the presence and the absence of biotin. Furthermore, the thermally induced conformational changes observed in the absence of biotin were irreversible upon cooling of the protein solution, owing to aggregation of the thermally unfolded protein, whereas in the presence of biotin the protein unfolded and refolded via the same pathway. Variable-temperature FTIR spectroscopy and 2D correlation analysis were also employed to examine correlations between absorptions in the amide I and amide III regions in the spectra of four proteins. The results suggested that the band at 1284 cm-1 in the amide III region may be tentatively assigned to the intermolecular beta-sheet structure formed upon aggregation of thermally unfolded protein. FTIR studies were also conducted to investigate the interaction between the catalytic and regulatory subunits of the enzyme ATCase. The secondary structure of the ATCase holoenzyme was stable up to 60°C. The isolated regulatory subunit denatured at approximately 47°C while the isolated catalytic subunit was thermall</description><creator>Ismoyo, Fenny.</creator><contributor>Ismail, Ashraf A.
