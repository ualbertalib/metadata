Ranging patterns for 4 troops of vervets in Barbados were shown to be influenced by the maximum daily temperature and the mean daily humidity. The frequency of use of an area decreased with increasing distance from the sleeping site, and the duration of use increased with increasing distance from the sleeping site. An interpopulation comparison of home range size and ranging patterns of vervet populations from Africa and St. Kitts, showed a positive correlation between home range size and group size and a negative correlation between home range size and population density. The genetic structure of the Barbados population was characterized by relatively high levels of heterozygosity and gene diversity at the group level, and small genetic distances between groups indicating adequate gene flow between groups. Three of the 6 polymorphic loci investigated showed differences in allele frequency between east and west sub-populations of vervets, indicating some genetic differentiation.</description><creator>Richardson, Karen S.</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Cercopithecus aethiops -- Geographical distribution.</subject><subject>Population genetics.</subject><subject>Cercopithecus -- Barbados.</subject><title>Space use by vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) and its consequences for the genetic structure of the Barbados population</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128nf80s.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r207tq50j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:j9602201t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:29:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Firstborns' behaviours were examined at different weeks of the mother's pregnancy. Their behaviours were compared to those of preschoolers whose mothers were not expecting. Eighty preschoolers participated: 20 from each trimester of the mother's pregnancy and 20 in a comparison group. At 16 and 20 weeks, first trimester firstborns had fewer difficulties with separation, insecurity, and dependency than at 12 weeks. At 24 and 28 weeks, second trimester firstborns were less dependent than at 20 weeks, and at 28 weeks less insecure than at 20 weeks. At 38 weeks, third trimester firstborns exhibited fewer separation and dependency behaviours than at 28 weeks. First and third trimester firstborns differed from the comparison group, but not in the expected direction. At 16 and 20 weeks, firstborns showed fewer separation problems than the comparison group. At 16 weeks, firstborn boys were less insecure than their counterparts, and at 38 weeks, firstborn boys had fewer separation problems and were less angry than comparison boys.

This study is undertaken to examine how the predominance of a scientific approach to medicine and health care undermines other crucial aspects of the relationship between patients and care givers. The role and function of language and its relationship to the ascription of human agency in the clinical setting is discussed. A patient's understanding and interpretation of the meaning of illness or disease requires a dialogue between patient and care giver such that the patient's agential horizons are incorporated into the decision-making process. A review is called for, therefore, of the dominance given to the technological over the human agential dimensions of decision-making in the health care environment.</description><creator>Rogers, Joanna</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Agent (Philosophy)</subject><subject>Decision making -- Moral and ethical aspects.</subject><subject>Physician and patient</subject><subject>Medical ethics</subject><title>"Agency and language in the clinical setting"</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4m90dw69p.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w6634492k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Religious Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jm214q251</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:29:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is a comparative, data-based analysis of the empirical validity of three competing sociological models of the psychological impact of size of place of residence. The theories subjected to statistical investigation are: the ecological school of Wirth (1938), the compositionalist approach of Gans (1962) and the subcultural arguments of Fischer (1976). A secondary data analysis of selected variables from the 1979 Canadian Quality of Life Survey forms the core of this thesis. Two dimensions of the potential psychological impact of urban size are examined: powerlessness, measured by an index variable of a "sense of personal competence" and social isolation, measured by a reported sense of loneliness and contacts with significant others. Consistent with the compositionalist model, the analysis of variance performed in this research shows no association between urban size and powerlessness, after controlling for socio-economic and demographic factors. Loneliness however, shows a curvilinear negatively sloped relationship with urban size after controlling for factors lending partial support to the subcultural model. Neighbourhood involvement exhibited a significant negative association with urban size. This finding, is attributable to the relative lack of importance of proximity in the urban setting which reduces neighbourhood contacts in favour of trans-local ones. Finally, when controlling for distance of residence of children living away from home, the effect of the size of place of residence on the frequency of contact with children living away from home, reported by the respondents was significantly reduced thus, partly supporting the subcultural model's proposition.</description><creator>Quesney, Consuelo Err√°zuriz</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Social isolation -- Canada</subject><subject>Canada -- Social conditions</subject><subject>Urbanization -- Canada</subject><title>Powerlessness and social isolation as a function of urban size in Canada</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5q47rp80v.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jm214q251</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Sociology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5138jf98g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:29:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We prospectively followed 314 children with an acute asthmatic attack who presented and were discharged from the emergency room of the Montreal Children's Hospital, to identify risk factors for relapse, i.e. a second ER visit for asthma within the next 10 days. Ninety-six of the 314 children relapsed, most within 24 hours. Using multiple logistic regression, a predictive model for relapse was developed on 211 patients. The best model contained two variables: (1) the number of ER visits for acute asthma in the previous year and (2) the intake of a short-acting theophylline preparation during the course of the ER treatment. When applied to the subsequent "validation set" sensitivity was 73%, specificity 50% and PPV 41%, thus indicating the robustness of the model. Based on the total sample, the probability of relapse was 31%. Patients with $ ge$4 ER visits for acute asthma in the past year (frequent visitors) had a probability of relapse of 45% vs 20% for nonfrequent visitors. The intake of short-acting theophylline during the ER visit reduced the probability of relapse from 50% to 34% among the frequent visitors, and from 30% to 11% among the nonfrequent visitors.</description><creator>Ducharme, Francine M.

The findings revealed that the schools were very homogeneous. In the core job characteristics, autonomy was the most important motivating factor for teachers, followed by task significance, skill variety, feedback from the job and lastly task identity. In the critical psychological states, experienced meaningful of the work was the highest degree, followed by experienced responsibility for outcomes of the work, and knowledge of results of the work activities. Other dimensions revealed that dealing with others had a relatively high score, followed closely by internal work motivation, an outcome factor of the theory, and finally that feedback from agents was the lowest score. The motivating potential score of 174, out of a possible 343, reflected the overall potential of a job to foster internal work motivation on the part of the teacher.</description><creator>Fournier, Nicole Marie Lucille</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Employee motivation -- Qu√©bec (Province) -- Montr√©al</subject><subject>Teachers -- Job satisfaction</subject><title>Job motivation of secondary school teachers : an application of the job characteristics theory</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x346d5420.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xk81jm62j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jd472x57t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:29:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Method of Integral Relations is used to predict stress distributions in a granular half-space due to a normally applied two-dimensional surface load. The resulting stress profiles are compared with Boussinesq's solution for a two-dimensional elastic medium and with the results of experiments which were carried out in sand using an axi-symmetric geometry. The theory predicts that the behaviour of the solutions depends primarily on the shape of the surface loading profiles. A parabolic loading profile equivalent to that observed experimentally yields vertical normal stress profiles which have good qualitative agreement with the experimental results and with the Diffusion Equation solution of Harr et al. As the surface pressure distribution approaches a uniform one, the theory predicts the existence of double-peaked vertical normal stress profiles similar to those observed in experiments in rock masses under equivalent loading conditions.</description><creator>Fekete, N.</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Applied Mechanics.</subject><subject>Engineering, Civil.</subject><title>Prediction of stresses in granular media by an integral method</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6m311q44g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jd472x57t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9880vs143</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:29:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is concerned with a problem of literary history. It shows how the inscription of Baudelaire's sonnets in the field of literary discourse is inseparable from their inscription in the general context of mid-nineteenth century social discourse. Baudelaire's sonnets are first examined in terms of the French sonnet tradition, and seen to constitute a formal departure from the Classically defined sonnet. His sonnets are then considered against the background of the opposition of Classicism and Romanticism in order to show that they represented a synthesis of opposed poetic values. In Chapter 3, a close examination of the sonnets reveals a balance of formal, rhetorical, and thematic elements consistent with the synthetic tendencies identified earlier. The study of the poetics of Baudelaire's sonnets is followed by a review of his general aesthetic orientation. This review leads to the problem of the sonnets' relation to contemporary social discourse. By reading Baudelaire's sonnets in terms of the nineteenth-century discourse of progress, and in terms of Benjamin's theory of historical consciousness, I show that their aesthetics and Petrarchism, as well as their rhetorical and thematic features, had a definite counter-discursive significance.</description><creator>Brown, Douglas</creator><date>1989-10</date><subject>Sonnets, French -- History and criticism</subject><subject>Baudelaire, Charles, 1821-1867 -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><title>Baudelaire and the sonnet on the threshold of modernity</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9880vs15c.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9880vs143</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:b8515p48q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:29:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study was designed to characterize the cardiac output (Q$ sb{ rm c}$) response to progressive submaximal upright (U) exercise in CF patients. Secondly, the Q$ sb{ rm c}$ adjustments were compared to those of similar supine (S) exercise, in an attempt to assess myocardial accommodation to the enhanced ventricular preload in the S posture. Q$ sb{ rm c}$ generally increased with exercise intensity in both U and S positions, although gr.IV plateaued at 50% VO$ sb2$max (S). Maximal stroke volume index (SI) was achieved at 50% VO$ sb2$max (U) in all groups, except gr.IV and at 30% VO$ sb2$max (S) in all groups.

Forced to chose, the Italian community aligned itself with Anglophones. The portrait which has been cast by numerous authors evokes the image of an Italian immigrant used as a pawn in a fight which generally was not his and which he could not understand. An examination of the Italian press gives us a different image. St. Leonard represented more than a fight over the language issue. It was as much a dispute over the status of ethnic minorities in Quebec as it was over the language question. This study examines the immigrant's "Italianita" and how it helped shape his response to the ethnic tensions in St. Leonard.</description><creator>D'Andrea, Giuliano E.</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Saint-L√©onard (Ile-de-Montr√©al, Qu√©bec) -- History</subject><subject>Minorities -- Qu√©bec (Province) -- Montr√©al</subject><subject>Italian Canadians -- Qu√©bec (Province) -- Montr√©al</subject><title>When nationalisms collide : Montreal's Italian community and the St. Leonard crisis, 1967-1969</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cz30pt83s.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tq57ns233</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hx11xg21x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:29:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis the writer outlines one form that an evolutionary-developmental paradigm of humankind might take.
