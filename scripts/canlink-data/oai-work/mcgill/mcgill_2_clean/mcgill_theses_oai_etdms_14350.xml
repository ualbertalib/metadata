The concept of investigating upper atmosphere physics using guns was proposed by Dr. G.V. Bull. The early history and technique is described in various references. Initially, the program concentrated on launching pure ballistic vehicles. It became apparent by the spring of 1963 that, with the available launching system, the pure ballistic vehicle had attained its maximum performance which was in the region of 120 kilometers. In order to achieve better performance, in terms of payload and apogee, it became necessary to investigate other concepts.

The swirl velocity of the fluid at a point is defined as the vector sum of the tangential and axial components of velocity at that point. The average of this velocity over an annulus cross section has been used in the heat transfer and friction coefficient correlations, which have been determined experimentally in this thesis.

It is found that at high Reynolds number the jet may be self preserving if the free stream velocity varies as the downstream co-ordinate to a power which in turn depends on the non-dimensional velocity of the jet. The growth of the jet is then linear. The effect of an upstream boundary-layer on the outside of the slot is also cconsidered. This analysis is then applied to the outer part of the wall jet in a similar pressure gradient. The effect of the inner boundary-layer on the outer part of the flow is considered and formulae for the growth of the inner boundary-layer and the variation of skin friciton are given. Also a form for the non-dimensional mean velocity profile including the inner boundary-layer is suggested. [...]</description><creator>Patel, Rajnikant Purshottam.</creator><contributor>Mordell, D.

With the jet discharging at an angle and subsequently reattaching to the surface a separation bubble of low pressure was formed downstream of the slot which reduced the nose-up pitching moment about the guarter-chord point. The reattachment distances for this bubble have been successfully predicted by an extension of the Bourque-Newman theory for reattaching jets. The lift and moment coefficients before the stall were compared with Spence's jet flap theory which has been extended within the context of thin aerofoil theory, to include the effect of jet entrainment. It is predicted that the entrainment tends to increase the lift by increasing the effective camber of the aerofoil and the detailed agreement between this theory and experiment is good.</description><creator>Wygnanski, Israel.</creator><contributor>Molder, S.

Holtz (1950) showed that noradrenaline was the predominant catecholamine in brain tissues. In a study of the distribution of adrenaline and noradrenaline ("sympathin") in brain tissue from different areas, Vogt (1954) showed that these amines are found in all parts of the central nervous system but are unevenly distributed. The highest concentrations of amines were detected in the regions of sympathetic representation (diencephalic, mesencephalic and bulbar).

In particular, spectroscopy can be applied to reactions involving chemiluminescence in the visible and infrared regions. This thesis is concerned with two reactions of ozone. The first reaction, ozone with nitric oxide, forms an excited N02 molecule which is chemiluminescent. A study of the emission spectrum gives information, not only on the mechanisms involved, but also on the state of the excited species.
