The Leeward Islands are a single Colony with a federal structure. The Windwards, although under a single Governor, is not a single Colony but a federation of four Colonies. The Dependencies of Jamaica are politically distinct from the Colony of Jarnaica, although they are under the same Governor. In all there are fifteen separate political units in the British Caribbean, whether separate Colonies, Presidencies or Dependencies.</description><creator>Smith, Samuel.

Thin target and monitor foils were bombarded together by the internal beam of the 100 Mev McGill synchrocyclotron. Monitoring was based on the known (p,pn) cross section for C12. A 28-channel kicksorter, together with a NaI(Tl) crystal counter, was used to determine the yields of the several reaction products. Chemical separations were avoided in this way.

Thus the volatile oil content of the waste coniferous foliage cut annually in Canada is in excess of ten million pounds.

Demand for it prior to World War l was almost nil, but with the great technological advances that always accompany warfare it fast became important in numerous applications. Lithium was first discovered (1) by Arfvedsen in Sweden in 1817 while analyzing a sample of petalite – a lithium aluminum silicate. It was named after the Greek "litheos", meaning "stony", because it was thought to occur only in minerals.</description><creator>Sharratt, Harold. J.</creator><contributor>MacEwan, J.
