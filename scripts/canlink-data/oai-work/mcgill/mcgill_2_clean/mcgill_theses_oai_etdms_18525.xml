If, then, a second drop falls within a few minutes of the first, there is less contraction, and finally on the third or fourth drop, the response disappears altogether (Jennings, 1906). Here, in this marine polyp with the primitive nerve net is clearly exhibited one of the most pervasive phenomena of the animal kingdom decrement of response with repeated stimulation.</description><creator>Sharpless, Seth.

In the preface to the second edition of the Critique of Pure Reason he cites the experiment of Copernicus' in which, by reversing the habitually conceived relation between the earth and the other planets, this scientist was able to render a more exact explanation of their respective activities. On the analogy of such a procedure, Kant asks how it would be in metaphysics if instead of our assuming, as he claims had been done in the past, that all knowledge depends wholly on its abject, we assume the reverse relationship, and investigate the possibility that abjects depend in certain respects upon our knowledge.

M. Yan found that liquid ammonia at 25° C. extracted nearly 6% by weight of sugar maple wood. The extract was separated into three fractions, acetamide 4%, ''liquid ammonia lignin" 0.7%, and a polyuronide 0.8%. The liquid ammonia cleaved ester links, as shown by the nearly quantitative production of acetamide from the acetyl groups in the wood.

Whereas imperial planning maintained the power and authority of the state, and medieval planning that of the church and guild; contemporary planning is concerned primarily with social welfare.
