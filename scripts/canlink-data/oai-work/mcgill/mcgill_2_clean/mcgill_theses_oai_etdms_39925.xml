Visually elicited unitary responses of both pre- and postsynaptic origin were recorded in the reinnervated SC and were discriminated by selectively abolishing postsynaptic activity using GABA microiontophoresis. Activity from individual regenerated axonal arbors and from the neurons within their terminal field of innervation was confined to the superficial retinorecipient SC layers and could be recorded over a range of up to 200 $ mu$m in all planes. Analysis of such electrophysiological recordings suggests that the terminal arborizations of single regenerated RGC axons can establish functional synapses with several SC neurons and that the convergence of inputs from regenerated RGC axons is not required for the activation of SC neurons in response to light. Functional synapses established between regenerated RGC axons and SC neurons persisted for up to 60 weeks after grafting. Visually elicited responses were recorded in the contralateral SC from the regenerated projections of as many as 63 different RGCs. The extent of functional innervation by regenerated retinal axons accessing the SC at a single entry point covered up to 0.8 mm and 1.2 mm in the caudo-rostral and latero-medial planes, respectively. Despite large scale targeting errors in the functional reinnervation of the SC, the re-established retinal projections in the SC were not randomly deployed along the caudo-rostral axis. There was an overall tendency for the relative naso-temporal position of any two RGCs to be appropriately represented by their respective regenerated inputs in the SC along its caudo-rostral axis. This suggests that regenerating RGC axons may recognize caudo-rostral positional markers as they reinnervate the SC.</description><creator>Sauv√©, Yves</creator><contributor>Rasminsky, M.

In addition OA treatment led to the asynchronous solubilization of the subunits in Triton X-100 (Triton). This fragmentation corresponded with striking changes in the immunofluorescent staining pattern of NFs. Short-term OA treatment was fully reversible within 10 hrs. upon removal of the inhibitor from the culture medium. Based on the response to varying concentrations of both OA and calyculin A, another serine/threonine protein phosphatase inhibitor, fragmentation of NFs was inferred to be due to the inhibition of protein phosphatase-2A activity while the reduction in electrophoretic mobility of subunits was due to the additional inhibition of protein phosphatase-1. The OA-induced phosphate moieties on the low molecular weight NF subunit (NF-L) were localized, by chemical cleavage analysis, to the amino-terminal head domain and were removed in vitro by the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-2A but not by the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-1. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of the mid-sized NF subunit (NF-M) revealed that the OA-induced phosphate moieties on this subunit were also in the amino-terminal head domain. The Triton-soluble NF fragments were found, by immunoprecipitation under non-denaturing conditions, to be heteromers composed of NF-L/NF-M and NF-L/high molecular weight NF subunit. Similar heteromers were found in the small, naturally occurring Triton-soluble NF fraction from dorsal root ganglion cultures indicating that OA treatment amplifies a natural, dynamic process involving NF assembly/disassembly.</description><creator>Sacher, Michael G.

The generated knowledge is to be used in a computer based learning environment for fault diagnostic tasks. In the past, developers of such environments obtained diagnostic knowledge through a knowledge engineering exercise with human experts. There are a number of drawbacks associated with such an approach. A major bottleneck in the development of such learning environments was capturing human expertise for diagnosis of an application, encoding this knowledge in a suitable form in a computer, and then verifying this knowledge. This exercise also depends on the availability and cooperation of a knowledgeable human expert(s). If more than one expert participates in the knowledge acquisition process, one may obtain contradictory information. Furthermore, most of the diagnostic knowledge is highly application specific thus making it useless for other applications. The starting point of the methodology of this thesis is a description of a device in terms of the components, component behaviors, and interconnections between components (structural knowledge). The end point of the methodology is a set of rules that can be used to diagnose faults in the device. The intermediate points are a behavioral and causal descriptions of the device, and a set of domain independent diagnostic strategies. This methodology has been applied to a counter circuit in the domain of digital electronics to test both the ability of the fault diagnostic system to diagnose faults in a device as well as to test its efficiency. The rules generated were able to successfully detect all the faults that were inserted in the counter application. Furthermore, as more diagnostic strategies were included in the diagnostic rule generation, the efficiency of the diagnostic system improved considerably.</description><creator>Sandrasegaran, Kumbesan</creator><contributor>Malowany, A.

A formulation for deriving the equations of motion of these systems, based on Kane's method, is presented. In this formulation the concepts of constrained motion and the effect of nonlinear coupling between rigid-body motion and the elastic vibrations are examined in depth. Dynamics of constrained systems is studied with the main objective of deriving the complete, minimum-dimension set of equations of motion. The effect of rigid-body motion on the dynamic behavior of flexible systems, known as dynamic or geometric stiffening effect, is examined in detail. A formulation is developed and implemented in a symbolic computer code, FLXSIM, for deriving the analytical form of the equations of motion. Application of artificial constrained motion to devise open-loop control laws for tracking problems is proposed. A perturbation technique in conjunction with a phase-plane based optimal control analysis is proposed for near-minimum-time maneuvering of flexible multibody systems moving along a prescribed trajectory.

In the robotics domain, planning occurs at different levels of a robotic system; this research targets the problem of planning at the highest level of the hierarchy which is planning a course of actions to accomplish a task. Planning at this level is extremely complex due to the many combinatorial problems that must be solved before a real world plan can be formulated. Two major approaches have been adopted by the researchers: domain independent approaches and application dependent approaches. We believe that a completely domain independent planner is not feasible and an application dependent planner is too restrictive. This research effort focuses on developing a planning system which combines that advantages of the two approaches. We have outline a clear boundary between the domain independent and domain dependent modules of the planner and developed a framework for proper interaction of the two. A new representation scheme which used the inter-relationships of objects to model the world is proposed. Two classes of non-linear planning problems, monotone planning problems and non-monotone planning problems are identified and new generic algorithms are proposed to solve these problems. These algorithms, which are based on our new representation scheme, are sound and complete and embody a mechanism for incorporation of the domain knowledge in an algorithmic fashion. Based on these theoretical developments, a planning system is implemented which includes an expert system to find the task constraints, a graphic user interface and a simple workcell simulator for execution and verification of the generated plan. The robotic assembly domain is chosen as an application domain and the planning system is tested on variety of assembly examples.</description><creator>Noorhosseini, Seyed Majid</creator><contributor>Malowang, Alfred (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><subject>Artificial Intelligence.</subject><title>A new approach to the automatic robot action planning problem</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/st74cs40b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tm70mx420</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0p0969154</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:00:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Skeletal muscle fatigue and insufficient power output were two biological constraints impeding the application of this endogenous energy source for support of the failing ventricle. Our ability to manipulate muscle phenotypic expression by a transforming and continuous low frequency electrical stimulation and the development of synchronizable pulse-train stimulators have overcome these historical obstacles. This thesis addresses the hypothesis that fatigue-resistant transformed skeletal muscle can support the failing circulation. The work is divided into two major sections involving animal laboratory and clinical human experimentation. In acute dog models of heart failure we have demonstrated the feasibility of transformed latissimus dorsi muscle assisting the heart in various configurations: (1) to power a potentially implantable pericardiovascular mechanical assist device and (2) in hybrid union for biventricular failure with cardiomyoplasty and mechanical support for the right and left ventricles respectively. In another series of experiments using coronary sinus drainage as a surrogate marker for epicardial coronary flow we did not witness any compromise of epicardial coronary flow by the overlying muscle graft. In our clinical series of 5 patients with chronic heart failure, who were all rejected for transplantation and underwent dynamic cardiomyoplasty, our follow-up investigations have revealed insights into appropriate patient selection criteria and the potential underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms of this new surgical technique in the palliation of refractory heart failure.</description><creator>Odim, Jonah N.

One system consisted of filtering the water through filter basins covered with grass. The second system used geotextiles in filter basins. The third system consisted of flooding a section of a field. In this system, the water was filtered as it moved through the soil towards the subsurface drainage/irrigation drain pipes. It was found that grass filter basins are very efficient in removing sediment from river water. Grass filter basins having drain pipes placed in trenches 30 cm wide backfilled with sand gave the best results. More than 90% of sediments were removed from the river water. From the outflow measurements, it was found that less than 0.2% of the field to be irrigated needs to be devoted to the filtration system. Important filter design parameters, namely filtration rates per unit area of filter basin and per unit length of filter trench and drain pipe, were determined. Due to the fast clogging of the geotextile, filtration of river water through basins covered with geotextile was found to be impractical and expensive, as compared to filtration using water tolerant grasses as a basin cover. Flooding a section of the crop land combined with controlled drainage was found to be an efficient way of irrigating maize crop. The yields obtained with this system were comparable with those obtained with conventional subsurface irrigation. Flood irrigation combined with controlled drainage would be particularly commendable on relatively flat fields which have subsurface drains.</description><creator>Nsengiyumva, Dominique</creator><contributor>Broughton, Robert S.

These explanations were examined in six French-English bilingual children, observed between the ages of 18 and 30 months. They were observed separately in interaction with each of their parents. The results showed that the ULS hypothesis cannot explain children's language use. Similarly, parental input could not explain children's code-mixing. In contrast, children's dominance was shown to be the best explanation of their code-mixing. It was suggested that bilingual children are particularly likely to code-mix when they do not know a translation equivalent. These results suggest that bilingual children's code-mixing is largely due to performance factors rather than underlying competence.</description><creator>Nicoladis, Elena</creator><contributor>Genesee, Fred (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Bilingualism in children.</subject><subject>Code switching (Linguistics)</subject><subject>Language acquisition.</subject><title>Code-mixing in young bilingual children</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6w924d613.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ws859h514</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z316q345p</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:00:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The dynamics of low-frequency fluctuations (periods between 10 days and a season) is investigated. While those fluctuations are known to be forced, at least in part, by the underlying surface, the emphasis in this thesis is placed on processes taking place within the atmosphere. The thermal interaction between the high-frequency (periods 2 to 10 days) and the low-frequency flow is first investigated. The temporal and spatial relationship between the heat flux convergence by the synoptic-scale eddies and the low-frequency temperature field is identified. It is shown that the low-frequency temperature fluctuations are negatively correlated with the heat flux convergence by the synoptic-scale eddies, implying the damping effect of high frequency eddy heat flux on the slowly varying temperature field. The damping effect is not homogeneous in space, however, and different temperature patterns have different damping rates. The low-frequency temperature patterns over the North American and Siberian inland areas, where the strongest low-frequency temperature variances are observed, are associated with weak damping from the high-frequency eddies. A stronger dissipation is found for the low-frequency temperature variations in the storm track regions. We then examine the El Nino-related interannual variations of the transient eddy activity and the associated multiscale interactions. A dataset from the U.S. National Meteorological Center (NMC) of 24 years is used. The purpose is to determine when the seasonal mean flow is less dependent on processes internal to the atmosphere and therefore more dependent on external forcing and thus more predictable. The results show that during El Nino winters the low-frequency eddy activity is reduced over the North Pacific and the high-frequency baroclinic waves are shifted south-eastward of their normal position in the Pacific. Over the North Pacific less kinetic energy is supplied to the low-frequency eddies both from the large-scale seasonal mean flow and from the synoptic-scale eddies. Thus the atmosphere in that region is more "stable" during El Nino winters, and its state depends more on the external forcings. Finally, the atmospheric predictability is studied explicitly. A large number of numerical experiments are performed to determine whether the forecast skill is dependent on the weather regimes. The predictions are made with a T21 three-level quasi-geostrophic model. The relationship between the forecast behaviour and the "interannual" variation of the Pacific/North American (PNA) anomaly is investigated. Comparison of the error growth for the forecasts made during the positive and negative PNA phases indicates that little differences of error growth can be realized before about a week. After that period the forecast error grows faster during the negative PNA phases. The forecast skill for the medium- and long-range predictions over the North Pacific, the North American and the North Atlantic regions is higher during the positive PNA phase than that during the negative PNA phase. A global signal of this relationship is also observed. The physical mechanism for the difference of error growth is discussed.</description><creator>Lin, Hai</creator><contributor>Derome, Jacques (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</subject><title>On the interaction among the extratropical atmospheric transients of different frequencies</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5712m870g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z316q345p</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6682x5835</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:00:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Glucocorticoids and somatostatin both influence a broad spectrum of biological activities and their actions are cooperative in growth control, pancreatic islet function, immune suppression, and stress response, e.g. in vivo studies indicate that glucocorticoids may act through somatostatin to suppress growth, growth hormone secretion and inflammation. Recent studies have suggested that glucocorticoids influence somatostatin production but the precise nature of this effect has remained unclear. In this thesis, I characterized the actions of glucocorticoids on somatostatin gene expression and their molecular mechanisms of action in three consecutive studies. (1) I started with an investigation of the in vivo and in vitro effects of glucocorticoids and found that dexamethasone exerts significant effects on somatostatin peptide and steady state mRNA levels in normal somatostatinoma (1027B$ sb2$) cells. Glucocorticoids stimulate somatostatin production in peripheral tissues (stomach, pancreas, and jejunum) and suppress its biosynthesis in cerebral cortex and hypothalamus. Glucocorticoids induce dose-dependent biphasic effects on steady state somatostatin-mRNA levels in normal rat islet and 1027B$ sb2$ cells, characterized by stimulation at low doses (10$ sp{-10}$ M) and marked inhibition at high doses ($ geq$10$ sp{-7}$ M). This suggests a complex molecular mechanisms of glucocorticoid action on the somatostatin gene involving multi-level regulation. (2) I further discovered that glucocorticoids stimulate somatostatin gene transcription in PC12 (pheochromocytoma) cells transfected with somatostatin promoter-CAT (chloramphenicol acetyl transferase) reporter gene. Dexamethasone induces a dose-dependent 2.2 fold stimulation of somatostatin-CAT expression in PC12 cells and exerts an additive effect on cAMP-induced gene transcription. The dexamethasone effect is abolished in A126-1B2 (protein kinase A-deficient mutant PC12) cells and with CRE (cAMP response element) mutant</description><creator>Liu, Jun-Li</creator><contributor>Patel, Yogesh C.

Such circuits are composed of gates that determine if the sum of their inputs is greater than a certain threshold. When restricted to polynomial size, these circuits compute exactly the functions in the class TC$ sp0$. These circuits are usually studied by measuring their efficiency in terms of their total depth. Using this point of view, the best division and iterated multiplication circuits have depth three and four, respectively. In this thesis, we propose a different approach. Since threshold gates are much more powerful than AND-OR gates, we allow the explicit use of AND-OR gates and consider the main measure of complexity to be the majority-depth of the circuit, i.e. the maximum number of threshold gates on any path in the circuit. Using this approach, we obtain division and iterated multiplication circuits of total depth four and five, but of majority-depth two and three. The technique used is called Chinese remaindering. We present this technique as a general tool for computing functions with integer values and use it to obtain depth-four threshold circuits of majority-depth two for other arithmetic problems such as the logarithm and power series approximation. We also consider the iterated multiplication problem for integers modulo q and for finite fields. The notion of majority-depth naturally leads to a hierarchy of subclasses of TC$ sp0$. We investigate this hierarchy and show that it is closely related to the usual depth hierarchy.</description><creator>Maciel, Alexis</creator><contributor>Trerien, Denis (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Threshold circuits of small majority-depth</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dr26z031s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xd07gv565</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:b8515q35v</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:00:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis considers the problem of trajectory generation for robot manipulators along fixed Cartesian paths which contain, or pass near, kinematic singularities. Following a path near singularities can cause very large velocities and accelerations in the robot's joints. Results are presented in this thesis to help understand and cope with this problem. Attention is focused on Cartesian paths which are piecewise analytic. First, it is shown that the joint solutions for such paths can always be expressed, in the neighborhood of a singularity, by means of a fractional power series. This implies a way to smoothly reparameterize the joint solution in the vicinity of a singularity. Second, the Optimal Admissible Timing (OAT) algorithm is presented, which utilizes this reparameterization to generate a minimum-time trajectory along a prescribed path, subject to fixed bounds on the velocities and accelerations of the robot's joints. Finally, an approximate implementation, called the Discrete Admissible OAT (DAO) algorithm, is presented, which works by specifying path velocities at a discrete set of knot points within the path interval. Experimental results are shown for the planar 2R robot and the PUMA robot.</description><creator>Lloyd, John, 1958-</creator><contributor>Hayward, Vincent (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Robot trajectory generation for paths with kinematic singularities</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bn9998575.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b8515q35v</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:w3763895c</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:00:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>DNA methylation has been shown to be involved in switching a number of genes on or off in particular cells. The relationship between DNA methylation and $ beta$-casein gene expression in the mammary tissue of lactating cows and mammary epithelial cells was examined. A positive correlation existed between hypomethylation of two MspI/HpaII sites in the body and one MspI/HpaII site in the 3$ sp prime$ end of the $ beta$-casein gene and its expression. In addition to these sites, hypomethylation of a distal MspI/HpaII site and HindIII sensitivity at a HindIII site also correlated with gene expression. Five DNase I hypersensitive sites were located within a 8 kb fragment. These sites designated as H1 to H5 were mapped approximately $-5, -1.3, -0.2,$ 1.7 and 2.5 kb with respect to the start site of transcription, respectively. The H2 and H3 sites were within a 1790 bp sequence that has been reported to contain a responsive element for prolactin and extracellular matrix dependent regulation and the binding site for mammary gland specific factor. To study the dynamic changes in hypomenthylation at the MspI/HpaII sites and HindIII sensitivity, mammary tissues from pregnant heifers were evaluated. Site specific demethylation was observed depending on the stage of gestation. Demethylation of two MspI/HpaII sites (denoted M2 and M4) occurred during the early gestation, progressed slowly until mid-pregnancy, and rapidly during the last part of pregnancy. During the early stages of gestation, changes in the HindIII sensitivity in the coding domain of the $ beta$-casein gene also took place. Despite changes in HindIII sensitivity, the second HindIII site remained resistant to HindIII. By the fifth stage of gestation, the third MspI/HpaII site (M3) became less methylated and during this time the H2 site became more sensitive to HindIII. Northern analysis confirmed that demethylation of the M3 site and the acquisition of HindIII sensitivity at the H2 site was correlated with $ beta$-casein transcription. Although $ alpha$-lactalbumin and $ beta$-casein genes are structurally and evolutionarily unrelated, they likely share common regulatory features, since both are expressed in the mammary gland during lactation. To investigate this possibility, methylation of the $ alpha$-lactalbumin gene was examined. In vivo studies revealed hypomethylation of the bovine $ alpha$-lactalbumin gene at two MspI sites and a cluster of two HhaI sites during the first and second stage of gestation, respectively. Furthermore, hypomethylation events occured only in the functional gene and not in pseudogenes, and the hypomethylation pattern was established prior to gene expression. Taken together, the present finding suggest that DNA hypomethylation is necessary for the expression of two mammary-specific milk protein genes, $ beta$-casein and $ alpha$-lactalbumin. Hypermethylation within the body of these genes may silence these genes in non-expressing tissues and in non-epithelial cells within the mammary gland during lactation.</description><creator>Huynh, The Hung</creator><contributor>Turner, Jeffrey D.

By using long-range restriction mapping, we have mapped the Ahi-1 locus approximately 35 kbp downstream of the Myb gene. To test whether provirus integration in the Ahi-1 region enhances the expression of Myb by cis-acting mechanism, we have also examined Myb gene expression in A-MuLV-induced pre-B-lymphomas. Our data have revealed that there is no clear evidence for such activation in the tumors we have tested, indicating that provirus insertion in the Ahi-1 region may activate a novel gene, apparently involved in tumor formation. In addition, another provirus integration site which was identified in 14% of immature T-cell thymomas induced by Mo-MuLV infection of MMTV${{ rm D} over C}$-Myc transgenic mice has recently been mapped within the Ahi-1 region. We have used exon amplification to identify genes that may cooperate with v-Ab1 or c-Myc in B- and T-cell transformation. We have indeed identified a novel Ahi-1 gene which encodes two major RNA species of 2 kbp and 5 kbp. The Ahi-1 gene is expressed in several organs of the mouse and rat and is highly expressed in brain and testis. One cluster of the proviruses was found to integrate 3$ sp prime$ of noncoding region of the Ahi-1 in an inverse transcriptional orientation. The Ahi-1 is highly conserved in evolution and encodes a 297 amino acid protein. The predicted Ahi-1 protein contains a SH3 domain and four potential SH3-binding sites, which function to mediate specific protein-protein interactions during signaling. The human homologue of the Ahi-1 gene has been cloned and mapped to chromosome 6q 23-24, and located approximately 330 kbp downstream of the Myb gene. The Ahi-1 is a novel gene which may play important roles in the signal transduction and tumor development. Mis-2 and Mis-4 loci were identified as two new common provirus integration sites in Moloney MuLV-induced thymomas. Mis-2 has been mapped on mouse chromosome 10 and located 160 and 40 kbp downstream of Myb and Ahi-1 genes. The Mis-4 locus has been located on chromosome 15 at about 60 and 30 kbp downstream of Myc and Mlvi-4 genes. Myc RNA levels are elevated in tumors harboring a Mis-4 rearrangement compared with some of those with no Mis-4 rearrangement, indicating that provirus integration affected Myc expression by long-distance activation. Both loci may contain novel genes involved in tumor formation.</description><creator>Jiang, Xiaoyan</creator><contributor>Jolicoeur, Paul (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><subject>Biology, Microbiology.</subject><title>Insertional mutagenesis by provirus in retrovirus-induced lymphoid murine tumors</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8w32r753x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8c97ks39t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ww72bd589</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:00:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Smooth delivery of molten metal to a chilled substrate is a key prerequisite for the development of a successful technique for thin-strip casting steel. In this work, a numerical model of a thin-strip, liquid steel delivery system was developed, validated, and used to make design predictions. The proposed slot-type planar-flow delivery system could contain a porous flow modifier, and features an extended-pool metal delivery system to the chilled substrate. The steady-state, computational-fluid-dynamic (C. F. D.) model developed for this research is two-dimensional, and uses the finite-difference, control-volume formulation. The implicit solutions for the fluid flow and energy fields are fully coupled and include treatment of the solidification phenomena using the enthalpy-porosity approach. The model includes porous flow modifying regions within the delivery zone. These are treated as regions of complex media and make use of the "Brinkman-Forchheimer extended-Darcy" model. Turbulence was modelled using an ad hoc approach for both effective viscosity and effective thermal conductivity. Numerical predictions of fluid flow were compared with experimental flow measurements and flow visualization using a water model of the proposed delivery system. The experiments confirmed that the flow modifiers had a very beneficial smoothing effect on fluid delivery to the substrate in the feeding system. The numerical predictions were in good agreement with the experimental results. As well, numerical predictions of shell thickness were compared with several different simple semi-analytical test cases. The model was used for several parametric studies. The effect of flow modification, in conjunction with varying pool lengths, was studied. The model predicted that the presence of the flow modifiers would smooth the fluid flow to the substrate, and promote even extraction of heat, despite extension of the reservoir's length. Extending the pool length delayed the onset of solidification. Another study made predictions for cases with differing inlet and substrate boundary conditions, as well as for different exit gap sizes. This part of the work demonstrated the type of predictions possible with this model for use in the design of a prototype of the proposed delivery system.</description><creator>Jefferies, Carol</creator><contributor>Guthrie, R.

Leaf traits were the most responsive to contrasting water regimes; canopy architecture, hydraulic conductivity and leaf phenology were less affected. Relative growth rate (RGR) under drought, however, was most closely related to variation in canopy duration: species in leaf longer had greater RGR. Secondarily, maintaining higher stomatal conductance (g) under drought further enhanced RGR. Higher g is associated with a higher photosynthetic rate (A), but the relationship between A and g varied with internal CO$ sb2$ concentration (c$ sb{ rm i}$), foliar nitrogen and specific leaf mass. Species with weaker homeostatic control over c$ rm sb{i}$ had higher water use efficiency. While photosynthetic characteristics were related primarily to species' shade tolerance, water use efficiency was most closely related to habitat moisture preference.</description><creator>Ives, Nadine E.

Two neurotrophins, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-3, failed to rescue NBM cholinergic neurons, while a similar dose of acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) was able to rescue them. Notably, lesioned NBM neurons treated with aFGF displayed somata size, as well as neuritic processes (dendrites and axons) and ChAT activity in the NBM similar to sham-operated animals. NBM cholinergic degeneration was consistent with the observed memory deficits, which was also prevented by aFGF treatment. The possibility of a direct effect of aFGF in NBM neurons remains obscure. However, our in vivo demonstration of aFGF-induced increase of NGF and its mRNA, in the neocortex of adult animals, entirely supports an indirect mechanism mediating aFGF effects. As endogenous NGF seemed to be responsible for these aFGF effects, we decided to further investigate other properties of NGF in these neurons. One goal was to analyze the effects of neocortical infarction and NGF treatment on low-affinity NGF receptor (p75$ rm sp{NGFR}$) and growth-associated phosphoprotein43 (GAP-43) mRNAs in NBM neurons. The increase of endogenous NGF in lesioned animals was consistent with the transient increase in the expression of p75$ rm sp{NGFR}$ mRNA, which was most pronounced after the exogenous application of NGF. Although GAP-43 plays an important role in neuronal regeneration and responded to cortical lesion with enhanced expression in NBM and pyramidal neurons, its expression was unaffected by NGF treatment. On the seventh post-lesion day, at the time when GAP-43 mRNA expression was increased in NBM and pyramidal neurons, which were displaying normal cell size, GAP-43 expression was dramatically reduced in thalamic neurons which were undergoing an accentuated cell death process. However, NGF did not increase the size of p</description><creator>Figueiredo, Bonald Cavalcante de</creator><contributor>Cuello, A.

To this end, six subjects performed goal-directed arm movements in the horizontal plane. Two movement amplitudes (300 mm and 400 mm) were completed at a moderate speed (1050 mm/s) and as-fast-as possible. The speed and amplitude conditions were repeated for the 45$ sp circ$ and 90$ sp circ$ movement directions. Finally, each of the movement conditions mentioned thus far, were performed within the right and left sections of the work-space. Surface electro-myographic activity was recorded from the pectoralis major, posterior deltoid, biceps brachii short head, brachioradialis, triceps brachii long head, and triceps brachii lateral head. Motion recordings were obtained with a spatial imaging system that monitored the positions of infrared emitting diodes attached to the subject's upper arm and forearm-hand complex. Several simplification schemes were found to be operative at the level of the electro-myogram. These include: (a) simple timing relationships for agonists between joints and agonist/antagonist intermuscle latencies within each joint; (b) tightly coupled timing between agonists within a single joint; (c) for a particular movement direction, the form and shape of EMG burst activity followed a strategy associated with modulation of pulse height and width; (d) the slope, duration, and onset were further affected by the direction of hand movement which resulted in the greatest RMS-EMG signal amplitude, changing in a predictable manner, and finally (e) there was tuning in which elbow muscles were activated earlier for goal-directed arm movements in the left area of the work-space.</description><creator>Gabriel, David Abraham</creator><contributor>Hoshizaki, Thomas Blaine (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Electromyography</subject><subject>Human mechanics</subject><subject>Arm -- Movements</subject><subject>Arm -- Muscles</subject><title>Muscle activation patterns for goal-directed multijoint arm movements</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v692t826d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/br86b527p</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physical Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3197xn63x</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:00:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Objective. To compare the risks and benefits of an Early Postpartum Discharge Program vs standard postpartum care. Design. Randomized controlled trial. Setting. 637-bed university-affiliated urban hospital. Participants. 175 healthy women recruited at 32-38 wks from MD and hospital ultrasound offices. Interventions. Early Postpartum Discharge Program: discharge 6-36 hours postpartum and nursing care by telephone and/or at home at 34-38 weeks gestation, $ leq$48 hours postpartum and 3, 5, and 10 days postpartum. Control. Postpartum stay of 48-72 hours and follow-up as determined by the woman's physician. Measurement/Results. At 1 month follow-up, no significant differences were seen overall in an established scale of perceived maternal competence (experimental-control = 4.3 points (95% confidence interval $-$7.7, 16.3)); infant weight gain (1.2 g/day ($-$2.8, 5.2)); identification of significant neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (rate ratio 0.50 (0.10, 2.51)); infant utilization of health services (rate ratio 0.88 (0.45, 1.73)); or predominant breastfeeding (adjusted odds ratio 1.25 (0.88, 1.75)). Early Postpartum Discharge Program participants, however, had significantly less frequent infant bilirubin testing (rate ratio 0.39 (0.17, 0.94)). The Early Postpartum Discharge Program also enhanced maternal competence in recent immigrants (26.9 points (2.7, 51.5)). Conclusion. The Early Postpartum Discharge Program leads to no apparent harm and may yield important benefits for some mothers and infants.</description><creator>Gagnon, Anita J.

Each rigid body is modeled by the union of polytopes. Safe and reliable collision detection algorithms are constructed. Since the computer representation of real numbers is finite, an interval projective point is used to encompass all localization errors of a modeled point. An interval point is the elementary geometrical form from which all others are constructed. The Euclidean convex set spanned by an interval point is also a polytope. The construction of a polytope relies on a robust convex hull algorithm. The computed hull is guaranteed to contain all interval projective points. An extrusion based collision detection algorithm builds an AND-OR decision tree. Each leaf is a univariate function that expresses the relation between a moving point and a moving plane. Interval zero finding methods are applied to find the overlap and non-overlap portions of the trajectories of moving polytopes. The swept-volume based collision detection algorithm depends on the construction of a convex approximation that comprises the real swept volume. To obtain a convex approximation, the convex hull algorithm is applied to the bounding volumes of the vertices of a moving polytope. Each bounding volume is an interval projective point. Finally, both collision detection algorithms are tested in the context of generate-and-test path planning.</description><creator>Foisy, Andr√©</creator><contributor>Hayward, Vincent (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Engineering, Civil.</subject><title>Robust collision detection</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hh63sx76g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d504rn23b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cn69m597s</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:00:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study focused on the comprehension and cognitive processing of texts in biology by 36 graduate science students for whom Chinese was their first (L1) and English their second language (L2). The students in the study were from two disciplines: one in biology, and the other in engineering. These groups were subdivided into less proficient L2 (i.e., low-intermediate to intermediate) and more proficient L2 group (i.e., high-intermediate to high). From the perspective of a stratified model, the study examined L1 and L2 comprehension of general biology texts. Specifically, it investigated the effects of readers' domain-specific knowledge and language proficiency on various levels of discourse processing. It also examined two methodological issues: the effects of language of recall on processing of semantic and syntactic information from the L2 texts and the validity of using self-rating of text difficulty or content familiarity to index background knowledge. Domain-specific knowledge was found to affect every aspect of comprehension of semantic information that was assessed in the study for both the L1 and the L2 texts. It also affected efficiency of processing for the L2 texts. Language proficiency, on the other hand, consistently affected lower-level processing. However, it appeared to have few concomitant effects on processing of semantic information. These results were consistent with predictions from stratified models of discourse comprehension in which processing of syntactic and semantic information are viewed as being both multilevel and modular. The results of the study also suggest the importance of investigating background knowledge in content-specific terms. Although the science students generally were comparable both in their knowledge of science text structures and in their patterns of comprehension of different types of semantic information, this comparability did not result in comparable comprehension. Rather, comprehension depended heavily on domain-specific knowledge. With reference to linguistic distance, the results of this study suggest that caution is needed in applying conclusions drawn from studies of speakers of languages of the same Indo-European family to speakers of languages of greater linguistic distance such as Chinese and English. The lack of production effects observed in this study may be due to differential processing of syntactic information as well as differential processing strategies that many readers reported to have used with different language conditions. Finally, the general discrepancy between perceived text difficulty vs. comprehension and efficiency of processing as assessed by the objective measures suggests caution in using self-rating of text difficulty or content familiarity to index background knowledge.</description><creator>Chen, Qin, 1962-</creator><contributor>Donin, Janet (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Psycholinguistics</subject><subject>Reading comprehension</subject><subject>Context effects (Psychology)</subject><title>Comprehension of science texts : effects of domain-specific knowledge and language proficiency</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3197xn646.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cn69m597s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pz50gz035</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:00:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The main objectives of this research are to propose a general stochastic method for determining analytically the distribution of flood volume, and to develop a simulation procedure for generating synthetic multiseason streamflows at different sites simultaneously. The research study is divided into two parts: (a) First, a general stochastic model is proposed to derive analytically the probability distribution function for flood volume. The volume of a flood is defined as the sum of an unbroken sequence of consecutive daily flows above a given truncation level. Analytical expressions were then derived for the exact distribution of flood volume for various cases in which successive flow exceedances can be assumed to be either independent or correlated, and the cumulative flow exceedance can be considered to be independent or dependent of the corresponding flood duration. The proposed stochastic method is more general and more flexible than empirical fitting approach because it can take explicitly into account different stochastic properties inherent in the underlying streamflow process. Results of a numerical application have shown that the proposed model could provide a very good fit between observed and theoretical results. Further, in the estimation of flood volume distribution, it has been found that the effect of the serial correlation property of the flow series is not significant as compared to the impact due to the dependence between flood volume and corresponding duration. Finally, it has been demonstrated that the simplistic assumption of triangular flood hydrograph shape, as usually appeared in previous studies, is not necessary in the estimation of flood volume distribution. (b) Second, a multivariate stochastic simulation approach is proposed for generating synthetic seasonal streamflow series at a single location or at many different locations concurrently. The suggested simulation scheme is based on the combination of the singular value decomposition</description><creator>Chaleeraktrakoon, Chavalit</creator><contributor>Nguyen, V-T-V.

Although the method was developed specifically to study the stress and strain properties of pericardium (the membrane which encloses the heart), it is general in scope and is applicable to many other tissue types. Unlike existing test methods which only sample the material strain at a few selected points, the technique described in this thesis is a true full-field method: that is, the strain field is sampled uniformly at a high number of points across the entire material surface. The displacement and strain measurements are performed using laser-based electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI) operating in transmission mode. Furthermore, unlike existing methods which only provide pure biaxial testing, the apparatus described here can apply any arbitrary planar stress configuration to the membrane under test, so that any aspect of the material behavior may be selectively emphasized. In the course of this work, a new technique of phase unwrapping was developed to analyze optical phase images with a high noise content, such as speckle images. The method is robust and allows the analysis to be completely automated. Finally, the large volume of data generated by the experimental apparatus was analyzed and modeled using the finite element method. In traditional applications, finite elements are used to predict the behavior of material structures from known constitutive laws. In this application however, the finite element method was used for distributed parameter estimation in order to identify the unknown constitutive properties of the material under investigation. Experimental results which validate the entire procedure are presented. Calibration procedures, as well as theoretical noise calculations along with confirming experimental measurements are given.</description><creator>Charette, Paul Gilles</creator><contributor>Hunter, Ian W.

This cytodifferentiation is a prerequisite for parasite survival and for the establishment of the infection in the mammalian host. The differential screening of a L. donovani amastigote cDNA library using stage-specific cDNA probes allowed the identification of the A2 genes, which are only expressed by the parasite as an amastigote. A2 specific transcripts are developmentally expressed in Leishmania in response to a combination of pH and temperature shifts, conditions associated with the transfer from the insect vector to the phagolysosomal compartment in macrophages. The coding genes are clustered on a 850 kb chromosome and arranged in tandem arrays with copies of another gene, the A2rel gene. The developmental expression is mediated post-transcriptionally and involves elements located in the 3$ prime$ untranslated region; accurate processing by trans splicing is essential for the A2 mRNAs developmental accumulation in cells transferred into phagolysosomal conditions. The A2 protein product is composed mostly of highly repeated domains, carries a functional signal peptide at its amino-terminal end, and shares sequence homology with other developmentally expressed proteins in unrelated parasites of humans. Using A2 locus sequences, vectors and transfection systems were designed and developed to differentially express reporter or selectable markets specifically in the amastigote stage.</description><creator>Charest, Hugues</creator><contributor>Matlashewski, Gregory (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Leishmania -- Genetics.</subject><subject>Leishmaniasis.</subject><title>Developmental expression in Leishmania donovani : cloning and analysis of amastigote stage-specific-genes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sn00b0790.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rf55z972s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Parasitology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6682x584f</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:00:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Membrane distillation, a process in which vapor from a liquid feed passes through the pores of a hydrophobic membrane, was investigated as a possible technique for desalination and for the removal of ethanol, acetone and benzene from water. Three different membrane modules were used in the experiments examining the impact of operating variables upon permeate flux and quality. A mathematical model was developed and validated for the membrane distillation process. In the desalination study, two modules with built-in condensing surfaces were used for conducting experiments on flat membrane sheets. The quality of the permeate, quantified by conductivity measurements, and the permeate flux were monitored as feed concentration, feed temperature, feed flow rate, cooling temperature, and cooling water flow rate were varied. The effect of the distance between the membrane and condensing surface was investigated by adjusting the air gap within one of the modules. The feed streams tested included sodium chloride solutions and artificial seawater. The membrane materials used were PVDF and PTFE. At optimal conditions, fluxes as high as 26 kg/m$ sp2$hr were obtained. In all experiments, the rejection factor was above 95.5%. A flat-sheet cross-flow module was used to study the separation of dilute solutions of ethanol and acetone. The same operating parameters tested in the desalination experiments were varied for ethanol and acetone feeds. The upper feed concentrations tested were limited by the risk of membrane wetting to 10 wt% ethanol and 6 wt% acetone. Within the feed temperature range of $40 sp circ$C to $70 sp circ$C, ethanol selectivities of 2 to 3.5 and acetone selectivities of 2 to 6 were achieved. The maximum fluxes obtained were 2.15 kg/m$ sp2$hr for ethanol permeate and 2 kg/m$ sp2$hr for acetone permeate. A mathematical model, based on first principles of heat and mass transfer, was developed and validated on the desalination, ethanol, and acetone experimental data. Good agreement between experimental and predicted values was obtained with the model version incorporating temperature and concentration polarization. The possibility of using vacuum membrane distillation for treating water contaminated with volatile organic compounds was investigated by using benzene as a model compound. An experimental unit with polypropylene membrane tubes fitted within a polypropylene shell was used in the tests. Dilute benzene solutions were pumped through the lumen of tubular membranes while vacuum was applied to the shell side. The data obtained by varying operating conditions was analyzed in terms of the overall mass transfer coefficient based on the film theory. A comparison between the effectiveness of membrane distillation and air-stripping was drawn based on a published case study. The experimental unit with tubular membranes failed to compete but extrapolations to higher membrane contact areas showed promise for hollow fiber modules.</description><creator>Banat, Fawzi Ahmed</creator><contributor>Simandl, J.
