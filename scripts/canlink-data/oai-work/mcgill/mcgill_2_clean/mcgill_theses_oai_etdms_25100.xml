Recent attempts in generating  biomimetic synthetic polymers have been flawed by a lack of structural control. To  overcome this shortcoming, we generated molecular recognition polymers and  copolymers containing a regioselective arrangement of thymine/uracil analogs via  Ring-Opening Metathesis Polymerization (ROMP). The ROMP of  exo-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboximide was found to fulfill the  criteria for a living polymerization. This gave access to polymers with narrow  molecular weight distribution and well-controlled architecture. Furthermore, the  living character of the reaction allowed for the facile synthesis of diblock  copolymers. We have synthesized diblock copolymers containing a small hydrophilic  block bearing molecular recognition units and a longer hydrophobic block consisting  of long pendant alkyl chains. These copolymers undergo self-assembly into nanoscale  aggregates with surface localized multi-point hydrogen bonding sites. Finally,  molecular recognition properties of monomers and polymers containing the  thymine/uracil analogs were characterized by 1H NMR and HPLC.</description><creator>Dalphond, Jake</creator><contributor>Sleiman, Hanadi F.

NMD is a translation-dependent  cytoplasmic and nucleus-associated event. Eukaryotic initiation factor 4AIII  (eIF4AIII) is a RNA-helicase protein found mostly in the nucleus. It is related to  the eIF4AI and eIF4AII proteins, which are localized to the cytoplasm where they are  involved in translation initiation. The role of eIF4AIII in nucleus-associated NMD  was investigated in this work. HeLa cells were treated with small interfering RNA  (siRNA) targeted against eIF4AIII. Immunoblot analysis revealed 45 to 93% knockdown  of eIF4AM protein levels compared to nontransfected cells. RNA from siRNA-treated  HeLa cells stably transfected with the T-cell receptor-beta (TCR-beta) gene  possessing a PTC was analyzed by Northern blotting. TCR-beta mRNA levels were  reduced in nontransfected cells, increased in eIF4AIII knockdown cells, and reduced  in exogenous HA-eIF4AIII rescued cells. A helicase-dead mutant of eIF4AIII (PRRVAA)  also rescues the TCR-beta mRNA decay. Pulse-labelling experiments using radioactive  35S-methionine revealed that eIF4AIII knockdown cells had a reduced (~50%)  translational rate compared to nontransfected cells. This data suggests that  eIF4AIII is involved in nucleus-associated nonsense-mediated decay and also has a  role in general translation.</description><creator>Bottari, Nicolas</creator><contributor>Sonenberg, Nahum (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><title>Putative role of eukaryotic initiation factor 4AIII in the nucleus</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8623hz35s.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sn009z462</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8623hz34h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:13:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We first present a brief overview of the quark-gluon plasma  (QGP) and its possible production in a heavy ion collision.

Wistar  rats (n = 48) of both sexes were divided into 3 groups and offered a simultaneous  choice of 2 diets: a carbohydrate-rich diet and a protein-rich diet, with a  different type of carbohydrate and protein in each of the groups. Increased short-  (4h post-injection) and long-term (12h post-injection) nocturnal total food intake  was found following intraperitoneal administration of melatonin (10 000 and 15 000  pg/ml blood) at dark onset. Melatonin increased short-term carbohydrate-rich diet  intake similarly across sensory contrasting diets (dextrin/cornstarch, cornstarch,  and sucrose/cornstarch) and genders. However, melatonin caused an inconsistent  increase in protein-rich diet intake across the various diets (casein, soy isolate,  and egg protein) and genders. In conclusion, melatonin favors carbohydrate intake at  the beginning of the activity period, and may act as a time indicator that provides  a night signal.</description><creator>Angers, Kathleen</creator><contributor>Thibault, Louise (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Melatonin.</subject><subject>Food preferences.</subject><subject>Rats -- Food.</subject><title>Effect of melatonin on food intake and macronutrient choice in rats</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n870zr344.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/44558d926</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z316q209m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:13:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>OV90, a spontaneously immortalized epithelial ovarian cancer  (EOC) cell line, has been shown to contain a homogeneously staining region (HSR)  originating from chromosome 22.

Genomic differential PCR and dot blot analysis showed that overexpression is  consistent with gene amplification, as all sequences tested within the 1 Mb region  of 22q11.21 are present in increased copy number. However, overexpression was not  common, as only two of 69 EOC samples evaluated using the Hu6800 chip showed  overexpression of a gene amplified in OV90, and three other EOC cell lines did not  have increased expression in this region.

In recent decades, many agreements  instituting the right to self-government of First Nations have been concluded  between the federal and provincial governments and aboriginal peoples. It then  becomes important to evaluate the attempts of the two existing orders of government  and the courts of Canada as regards the right to self-government and assess the  potential usefulness of the two's efforts at defining and implementing the right.  Firstly, the importance and legitimacy of the right to self-government is recognized  through its beginnings in the human right norm of self-determination in  international law to the establishment of the right in Canadian domestic law.  Secondly, an evaluation of the principal attempts, on behalf of the governments and  the courts, to give meaning and scope to the aboriginal right to self-government,  which culminate in the conclusion of modern agreements, reveals their many  inefficiencies and the need for a workable and concrete alternative. Lastly, the  main lacunae of the negotiation process, the main process by which the right is  concluded and implemented, and the use of the courts to determine the scope and  protection of the right to self-government, are revealed. An analysis of European  initiatives to entrench the right to self-government, mainly the European Charter of  Self-Government and its established set of principles that guide the creation of  self-government agreements, are also used in order to propose a viable option for  the establishment of a principled framework for the aboriginal right to  self-government in Canada.</description><creator>Lavoie, Manon, 1975-</creator><contributor>Provost, Rene (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Indians of North America -- Canada -- Government relations</subject><subject>Indians of North America -- Canada -- Politics and government</subject><subject>Indigenous peoples -- Canada -- Politics and government</subject><subject>Indigenous peoples -- Canada -- Government relations</subject><subject>Indians of North America -- Legal status, laws, etc. -- Canada.</subject><subject>Indigenous peoples -- Legal status, laws, etc. -- Canada.</subject><title>The need fo a principled framework to effectively negotiate and implement the aboriginal right to self-government in Canada /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6969z143h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bc184</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kh04dq32v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:13:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Analysing the financial fate of the surviving spouse in French  and Ontario law reveals him or her to be both a partner and an heir. The patrimonial  union between the spouses is indeed a partnership which is terminated by the death  of one spouse. Moreover, marriage introduces each spouse into his or her partner's  family for the purposes of succession. The dual character of status of the surviving  spouse is the basis of the argument, advanced in this thesis, that this duality  represents an important commonality between the French and Ontario legal systems,  notwithstanding the disparities between the two. One of these disparities is the  surviving spouse's obligation, in Ontario, to choose between his or her matrimonial  and inheritance rights, except when the deceased has expressly provided that he or  she would not have to make this choice. Thus, while French law permits the surviving  spouse to deduct the amount of his or her inheritance portion from the deceased's  assets, even once the financial benefits of the marital partnership have been  apportioned, Ontario law seems to be unable to distinguish between the partition of  the marital partnership and the deceased's succession. After examining, in  particular, the surviving spouse's rights pursuant to mandatory and suppletive rules  of law, from the twin perspectives of spouse and heir, the thesis explores some  examples of the tools used by spouses for estate planning. In particular, marriage  contracts and life-insurance can dramatically affect, for better or worse, the fate  of the surviving spouse.</description><creator>Mouralis, Denis</creator><contributor>Kasirer, Nicholas (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Inheritance and succession -- Ontario</subject><subject>Husband and wife -- Ontario</subject><subject>Comparative law</subject><subject>Inheritance and succession -- France</subject><subject>Husband and wife -- France</subject><title>Le sort du conjoint survivant en France et en Ontario : un exercice de droit comparé</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3t945r41w.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kh04dq32v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cz30pt37p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:13:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Global Satellite Navigation System (GNSS), the core of the  International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Communication, Navigation,  Surveillance/Air Traffic Management concept is capable of supporting future aviation  needs. The implementation of this revolutionary technology however remains  overshadowed by a series of complex institutional and legal issues. The  extraterritorial control and ownership of existing GNSS systems coupled with the  dual character of this technology poses a serious threat to the concept of national  sovereignty as traditionally understood. This is further aggravated by the fact that  there exists only one de facto GNSS signal provider, thus placed in a position to  impose its own conditions without reference to the requirements of the rest of the  world. In an attempt to secure both European political independence and  a fair share in the global GNSS market Europe has decided to play an active role by  launching Galileo, an autonomous global constellation under the control of civil  authorities scheduled to be operational by 2008. The present thesis analyses the desirability of a suitable legal  and institutional GNSS framework to achieve universal acceptance of the GNSS.  However, in the context of the present status quo it is unrealistic to expect that  the only GNSS signal provider surrender its nationally procured system under the  umbrella of an international instrument. National security concerns and industrial  policy goals underlie this tendency. The present situation may turn different when  the incumbent GPS faces the competition of Galileo, an alternative civil system  willing to offer firm legal guarantees of service performance albeit in exchange for  a fee. The entire viability of this theory remains however dependent upon the  European capability of defining a successful business case for  Galileo.</description><creator>Rey-Ubago, Beatriz del</creator><contributor>Jakhu, R.

That is why it is critical that the EC accede to the Convention  following the example of its branches. Meanwhile, it is necessary to determine  whether the Member States could be held responsible for the Community's acts that  violate the rights protected by the Convention.

This thesis analyzes this contractual expansion of judicial review from an  international perspective. To this end, the standard of judicial review under the  most important international instruments pertaining to commercial arbitration is  examined: the New York Convention and the UNCITRAL Model Law on International  Commercial Arbitration. The study then addresses the question as to whether  provisions for heightened judicial review of arbitral awards would be enforceable  under the legislation of three major players in commercial arbitration: England,  France and the United States. An analysis of the legitimacy of agreements that  provide for expanded judicial review under the New York Convention and UNCITRAL  Model Law follows.

Since the last decade  however, new economy markets pose new challenges to this interface. Network effects,  interconnectivity, rapid innovation, and excludability are characteristics of new  economy markets. Particularly network effects can, in connection with copyright  protection, increase market power and provoke competition authorities to monitor the  exercise of copyrights. This thesis contains an analysis of the background and  underlying principles of Canadian copyright law and competition law. It gives an  overview over their interface in the legislation and the impact of competition  policy on copyright litigation. It also examines the Intellectual Property  Enforcement Guidelines that were issued by the Canadian Competition Bureau in  September 2000. The thesis concludes that competition law and copyright law are  complementary instruments that serve the same goals. The two bodies of law are  drafted so that they would not oppose one another. Instead of curbing copyright  protection through competition policy enforcement, new challenges posed by new  economy markets should be met by rethinking copyright policy and protection in these  markets.</description><creator>Aregger, Ruth</creator><contributor>Handa, Sunny (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Copyright -- Canada</subject><subject>Antitrust law -- Canada</subject><subject>Competition, Unfair -- Canada</subject><title>The impact of competition law on copyright law in new economy markets in Canada /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cv43nx61h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5712m725f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mk61rh63q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:13:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The complexity of information produced since the 1980's on  co-occurring severe mental illness and substance misuse makes it difficult for  social workers to grasp the current state of the question. This is a new field of  study, and much of the information is incomplete or contradictory. This review  examines epidemiological studies carried out in North America. We identify the  varied semantic and philosophical approaches to the question of dual diagnoses, and  provide an overview of etiological theories, as well as of the theory and practice  of treatment for these disorders. Emergent concepts of recovery are also  discussed. Major findings. epidemiological data vary, but all point to a  widespread problem. The diversity of meaning and of etiological theories appears to  be linked to the heterogeneity of this population. An integrated treatment strategy  is the current modality of choice, despite outcomes that are only mildly  encouraging; finally, there is consensus among consumers that recovery from a  disease is possible even in the absence of a complete cure. Research limitations and knowledge gaps are to be expected in a  new field of study. Additional research is necessary to determine the extent and  causes of these comorbidities. Social workers must become knowledgeable in this  field and remain abreast of new developments in order to engage in evidenced-based  practice. Greater education about comorbidities is necessary, as is an overarching  policy response from all levels of government. The principal contribution of this  master's thesis to the discipline of social work is to provide a general synthesis  of knowledge in a domain that is highly medicalized in the  literature.</description><creator>Lavergne, Martin</creator><contributor>Rowe, William (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Mental illness -- North America</subject><subject>Substance abuse -- North America</subject><title>A review of the literature on co-occurring severe mental illness and substance misuse : epidemiology, terminology, etiology, treatment, and recovery</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sx61dn00d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mk61rh63q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:08612p233</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:13:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study examined job satisfaction among social workers in a  correctional environment. A model was derived that defines job satisfaction as an  attitude based on environmental and personal factors. The purpose of this research  project was to examine what factors based on the model, lead to job satisfaction  within the Ministry of Public Safety and Security using the Job Satisfaction Survey  (Spector, 1997). Questionnaires and surveys were sent to all social work and  psychology staff employed in a correctional institution across Ontario. Results  support the model that both environmental and personal factors influence the  perception and assessment of job satisfaction. Overall the majority of social  workers working within the Ministry reported being satisfied (M = 115.0, SD = 27.3);  however, psychology staff reported greater job satisfaction (M = 137.9, SD = 21.3).  For social workers, supervision, co-workers and the work itself were the factors  that related to job satisfaction. Working conditions, communication, contingent  rewards and opportunities for promotions were related to dissatisfaction. The  proposed model offers suggestions to human service organizations that wish to  improve recruiting and retention of social workers.</description><creator>Monahan, Ronda</creator><contributor>Wright, Robin (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Job satisfaction</subject><subject>Social workers -- Job satisfaction</subject><subject>Correctional personnel -- Job satisfaction</subject><title>Job satisfaction among social workers in a correctional environment</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gh93h014s.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/08612p233</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8g84mm88k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:13:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>When Westernization was introduced into Ethiopia at the beginning of this century, it was to fulfil the need of a modernizing autocracy aspiring to enter the Technological Age. But through Westernization also came a very intense Anglo-American cultural penetration. The first group of Western-educated intelligentsia integrated themselves into the feudal system, embraced western values and the American way of life. Haile Selassie hoped that the American free enterprise system would absorb those his bureaucracy could not. The missionary zeal that guided America's global policy of "containment" also created a situation whereby the U.S., in order to influence Ethiopian politics and particularly its youth, invested heavily in the ideological sector. Thus, the feudal regime, the U.S., and the first generation of Western educated elites became necessarily interdependent. There was however, a seed of contradiction in this alliance and the ideological bond that tied them. American education which moulded the new Ethiopian intelligentsia is rooted in the liberal-utilitarian tradition which promotes the values of metropolitan market economies. Autonomy and individual freedom--which forms the core of this liberal-utilitarian ideology--was accepted at face value by the new intelligentsia, but these ideological values could not be implemented in Haile Selassie's Ethiopia which was a dependent, modernizing autocracy tied to a metropolitan nation. Due to the fact that dependency and autocracy are dialectically opposed to autonomy and individual freedom, the liberal education disseminated through the Ethiopian school system and the political ideals connected with it were negated by the prevalent political realities in Ethiopia. There was also a further paradox. Since Haile Selassie's authoritarian system was guided by metropolitan capitalism, the alienated elites came to reject the latter ideology and turned towards a Socialist Political Prism. Ultimately, these new breed of Western educated intelligentsia, who were mostly students and teachers, ignited the sparks of the revolutionary ferment in the country, and all the military had to do in 1974 was deliver a coup de grace to Haile Selassie's feudal regime.</description><creator>Milkias, Paulos.</creator><date>1982</date><subject>Ethiopia -- Politics and government -- 1889-1974.</subject><subject>Education -- Ethiopia.</subject><title>Political linkage : the relationship between education, western educated elites and the fall of Haile Selassie's feudal regime</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2n49t257q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8g84mm88k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Administration and Policy Studies in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rb68xc45f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:13:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Although Bakunin's 1842 article, "The Reaction in Germany," published in the organ of the Dresden Left Hegelians, Deutsche Jahrbucher, is generally held to be the most radical and eloquent manifesto of Left Hegelianism, the standard historical commentary tends to consider his pre-1842 Russian works as far removed from this revolutionary ideal. Most historians have long failed to discern the logical continuity in Mikhail Bakunin's thought before and after the "pivotal" date of 1840. Indeed, his intellectual development is usually dividied into two distinct, mutually exclusive periods. During the first period, pre-1840, Bakunin is presented as a conservative and a monarchist, dedicated to a spiritual and political compromise with the "rational reality of the Tsarist regime. After his arrival in Berlin in 1840, however, one is suddenly confronted with the political anarchist and instigator of world revolution. However, this abrupt dichotomy which appears in most historical commentaries dealing with Bakunin's writings and activities cannot be maintained. The hypothesis that there even occurred a break in the evolution of Bakunin's thought rests on a misinterpretation of his early Russian Hegelian works. The goal of this study is to demonstrate that the concern with the practical application of philosophy into a political tool for revolutionary acton forms the central theme of Bakunin's early works; and to show that his Berlin period constitutes the logical continuation of his early theoretical position. In effect, the present study represents a revindication of the young Bakunin and attempts to prove that his Hegelianism was central to the formation of his radical position. At the same time, it situates Russian Left Hegelianism in the mainstream of European radicalism, by showing how the ideas developed by Bakunin were moving in a direction parallel to those of the Young Hegelian movement in Germany.</description><creator>Del Giudice, Martine N.

In opposition to it, a new interpretation based on the critical ideas of freedom, morality and teleology is proposed. The transition from the Critiques to history and religion is justified in terms of the notion of "a priori end" and through the recognition of evil. Kant's ideas are viewed in the historical context of Leibniz, Lessing and Herder. Kant conceives history as the process of self-creation whereby man overcomes the split within his being between the rational and sensible. Providence and freedom are complementary grounds of this process. Kant's views on biology and history rely on a revolutionary conception of time as a principle of internal development in life. The development of political wisdom and religious symbols add to rational thought an essentially historical dimension.</description><creator>Sharkey, Robert John.</creator><contributor>Di Giovanni, George (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1982</date><subject>Herder, Johann Gottfried, 1744-1803.</subject><subject>Lessing, Gotthold Ephraim, 1729-1781.</subject><subject>Kant, Immanuel, 1724-1804.</subject><subject>History -- Philosophy.</subject><subject>Religion -- Philosophy.</subject><subject>Reason.</subject><subject>Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm, Freiherr von, 1646-1716.</subject><title>Kant on reason in history</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g158bh884.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b2773w291</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Philosophy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wh246s69d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:13:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Differentiation and gene expression in the oomycete Achlya ambisexualis ( strain E87) were studied during three responses, sexual antheridium formation, asexual sporangium formation and heat shock. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins labelled in vivo and in cell free systems directed by poly(A) mRNA showed that during formation of antheridia only one change was detectable in the proteins synthesized. No detectable changes were observable in the translatable poly(A) RNA population indicating that post-translational events may be required for differentiation. During early sporangium formation several proteins showed changes in relative rates of synthesis. These correlate with similar changes in cell free translation products suggesting a transcriptional level of regulation. Nucleic acid hybridization analyses of mRNA populations indicated that many new sequences appear late and accumulate in the spore. These late transcripts are probably utilized during spore germination. During heat shock several proteins showed rapid increases in rates of synthesis; these seem to be controlled at the level of transcription.</description><creator>Gwynne, David I.

The thesis also addresses the question of the relevance of Marxian economics for an understanding of contemporary capitalism. The first part of the thesis presents an overview of Marxian economics, more particularly a summary of Marx's Capital, Michio Morishima's Marx's Economics, and Ernest Mandel's Late Capitalism. The second part of the thesis reviews the conventional economic statistics in Canada over the 1961-76 period, elaborates the Marxian input-output frame-work as applied to the Canadian economy and estimates the basic Marxian categories such as variable capital, surplus value, and constant capital and the relationships between categories as expressed by the organic composition of capital, the rate of surplus value and the rate of profit. The final chapters of the thesis appraise the strengths and weaknesses of Capital and Late Capitalism and present an agenda for future research in empirical Marxian economics.</description><creator>Sharpe, Donald Andrew</creator><date>1982</date><subject>Canada -- Economic conditions -- 1945-</subject><subject>Marxian economics.</subject><title>The structure of the Canadian economy, 1961-76 : a Marxian input-output analysis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bn999733c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kk91fm119</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Economics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:b2773w30s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:13:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Body composition studies (BC) by a multiple isotope dilution technique were performed for studying nutritional parameters and nutritional support. A group of anthropometric, biochemical and immunological parameters were measured and the data indicated that these parameters were valid measures of the nutritional state for epidemiological studies; but, of little value in assessing the individual's nutritional state. Of 44 morbidly obese patients undergoing jejunoileal bypass, 33 patients lost only body fat. Eleven patients lost both body fat and body cell mass (BCM) thus developing protein malnutrition. Six of these malnourished patients had abnormal liver function tests (LFT), and both the BC and the LFT improved when calorie free amino acids were infused. BC studies were performed on TPN patients receiving one of four solutions. To evaluate the effect of these solutions on the daily repletion of the BCM a multiple linear regression was used. The regression indicated that the repletion of the depleted BCM was related to the lipid (p &lt; .01) and carbohydrate (p &lt; .001) infused, and the nutritional state (p &lt; .001). Carbohydrate was more efficient than lipid, in repleting the BCM, and increasing protein above 1.26 gm/kg/day had no benefit.</description><creator>Forse, Robert Armour.</creator><date>1981</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><title>The use of body composition to assess nutritional therapy /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s4655h256.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b2773w30s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Experimental Surgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7m01bm291</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:13:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The primary objective of this dissertation is to present and analyze Marx's theory of technological unemployment. Chapter I is a brief evaluation of the modern perspectives on this question. The levels of analysis in Marx are also identified. Chapter II considers Marx's short term model on technological unemployment when no net accumulation occurs. It includes a discussion of different measures and types of technological change. Chapter III complements the previous chapter. A theoretical definition of compensation is advanced, and the different forms of compensation in Marx are evaluated. This chapter also includes a broader discussion of the compensation controversy. Chapter IV constitutes Marx's long term model when technological change, population growth and accumulation occur simultaneously. Here, crises are ignored. Chapter V identifies the linkages between crises and technological unemployment. Throughout the dissertation, the short term, long term and crisis models are developed and compared. Included are two appendices, one dealing with the neo-classical approach, and the other with the role of wage flexibility in Marx's theory of technological unemployment.</description><creator>Yalinpala, Cemal.</creator><date>1981</date><subject>Marx, Karl, 1818-1883.</subject><subject>Technological unemployment.</subject><title>Karl Marx's theory of technological unemployment</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ft848r23q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7m01bm291</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Economics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k643b190x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:13:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The principle of the combined reversed-phase chromatographic electrochemical detection assay of the major serum thyroid hormones is demonstrated. The separation of 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T(,3)), 3,3',5'-triiodothyronine (rT(,3)) and 3,5,3',5'-tetraiodothyronine (T(,4)) has been studied as a function of solvent strength, pH, temperature and ionic strength. Detection was carried out using a thin-layer electrochemical detection cell set at 1.500 V containing a new material, low temperature isotropic carbon, as a working electrode. This material was evaluated against carbon paste and using it, subnanogram detection limits were noted for the above analytes under defined conditions. Investigation of the feasibility of this analysis applied to 1.0 mL serum samples was carried out using a combined solvent extraction-cation exchange resin clean-up approach.

Canada is characterized as an "advanced dependent-developed" country, exhibiting both "dependent" and "independent" directions in its economic development. The dissertation argues that a similar combination could be distinguished in foreign policy. A scale is elaborated identifying four hypothetical categorizations of policy: Independent; Limited-Independent; Active-Dependent; and, Dependent; and the scale is applied to critical points in Canada-Korea relations. The dissertation concludes that "Active-Dependence" is the most consistent conceptualization of Canadian policy and that the movement in this direction involved the gradual erosion of Canadian independence. This is directly related to the development of "continental economic integration" and Canadian "advanced dependent-developed" status.</description><creator>Galan, Meroslav.</creator><date>1981</date><subject>Canada -- Foreign relations.</subject><subject>Korea -- Foreign relations -- Canada.</subject><subject>Canada -- Foreign relations -- Korea.</subject><title>Canada-Korea relations 1947-1955 : the continentalization of Canadian foreign policy</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bn999734n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mw22v607c</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:c247ds74h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:13:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>E. R. Curtius' European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages demonstrated the extent to which medieval literature may be fruitfully examined in terms of the classical and Scriptural topoi which flourished in the poetry of the Middle Ages. His study, however, argued the continuity of these topoi so emphatically that he tended to slight the innovative treatment of the familiar models. It is generally acknowledged that Chaucer's use of bird imagery is derived for the most part from traditional sources which extend from Plato and Aristotle to the Bible and the patristic fathers, and from Ovid and Virgil to Jean de Meun and Dante. Furthermore, it is also recognized that Chaucer's use of conventional imagery produces startling and remarkably unconventional responses in his audience's imagination. This dissertation studies the conventions of bird imagery and Chaucer's artistic adaptation of these paradigms so as to understand how the poet poured new wine into old wineskins to create the successful combination of aging, body, and freshness. Chapter One investigates the philosophical and literary backgrounds to the medieval conventions of bird imagery. The topoi of birds representing bestial human nature, or avian society as a model for, or parallel to, human society lead to the convention of the bird fable. The bird/human double perspective in this convention offers the audience the opportunity to witness birds acting as humans and to therefore ridicule the behaviour of humans who have abused their rational faculties. On the other hand, the audience is also tempted to laugh at the birds who, acting as supposedly rational human beings, fall into intellectual and physical traps because they are not acting on instincts derived from natural grace. The recognition of the birds' higher perspective on earthly affairs, the belief that they mediate between the divine and the human, and that they reveal the mysteries of Christianity as "through a glass darkly" lead to the convention of birds as intellectual signs. This convention is clearly an extension of the classical use of the bird as a symbol of the deity; here, however, the emphasis is on "how" and "why" the birds' natural habits illustrate and explain mystical truths. Consequently, this convention provides a contemplative dimension to bird imagery, and it gradually moves from primarily Christian semiology to a broader philosophical language of signs. The final image pattern, the convention of birds-and-love, is a complex web of traditions which derives its emotional and intellectual power from all of the above themes. As the poet usually develops some aspect of the contrast between human and bird society or the contrast between the birds' earthly and aerial activities, the convention encompasses themes as diverse as frustration and celebration, alienation and reconciliation, and eros and caritas. Chapters Two, Three and Four follow the same format. Each provides a provenance for a convention up to the fourteenth century by discussing important poems which make significant contributions to the convention. Chaucer's poetry is then examined in the light of major themes within each convention. Although considerable attention is paid to bird imagery generally in the Chaucer canon, most of the emphasis will be on the House of Fame, the "Nun's Priest's Tale", and the Parlement of Foules. These "bird poems", I argue, are best approached in terms of conventions of bird imagery; by focusing on one convention at a time, one notes the ways in which Chaucer invests established patterns of imagery with fresh content, and, in particular, that he extends the bird imagery to express philosophical truth by developing the element of perspective, point of view, and analogy. An awareness of Chaucer's adaptation of conventional imagery provides a fresh perspective on both his "art" and his poems.</description><creator>Southmayd, David Edward.</creator><date>1980</date><subject>Chaucer, Geoffrey, d. 1400 -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><subject>Birds in literature.</subject><title>Chaucer and the medieval conventions of bird imagery</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x633f1820.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c247ds74h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bv73c109s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:13:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Glycosaminoglycan-peptide complexes (GAG-P) and some proteoglycans from long bones, breast muscle, comb, crop, gizzard, heart, infundibulum, intestines, isthmus, kidney, leg muscle, liver, lung, magnum, oesophagus, ovary, pancreas, proventriculus, skin, shell gland, spleen, trachea, vagina, wattle, cecum, egg yolk and adipose tissue of the white leghorn hen were isolated and analysed for constituent units.

This effect is specific, since both flurazepam and ethanol antagonized the inhibitory effects of serotonin, dopamine and glycine. Moreover the degree of potentiation of GABA-mediated electrically-evoked cortical inhibition produced by five benzodiazepines (Ro 21-3981, flurazepam, chlordiazepoxide, medazepam and clozapine): (a) correlated with their relative affinities for the benzodiazepine receptor when all five drugs were applied with equal iontophoretic doses; (b) was not significantly different from one drug to another, when the benzodiazepines were applied in doses inversely proportional to their relative affinities for the benzodiazepine receptor. Iontophoretically-applied flurazepam consistently potentiated the conductance increase produced by iontophoretically-applied GABA in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampus. Furthermore, both iontophoretically-applied flurazepam and intravenously injected ethanol consistently prolonged the time course of the GABA-mediated IPSP conductance increase evoked in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal hippocampal neurons by ipsilateral entorhinal or fimbrial stimulation. These effects were independent of membrane potential changes. It is concluded that GABAergic neurotransmission has a special role in the neurophysiology of anxiety. Since anxiety is involved in the etiology of alcoholism, and since chronic ethanol intake decreases GABA levels and alters the density of GABA receptors, the results of this thesis are consistent with the hypothesis that GABAergic mechanisms may be involved in the etiology of alcoholism.</description><creator>Nestoros, Joannis N.</creator><date>1980</date><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><title>Anti-anxiety agents and synaptic transmission in the brain : electrophysiological studies</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5t34sk20n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qf85nb81p</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anaesthesia Research</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):25125</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
