accumbens (NAcc), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and striatum (STR) was monitored in conscious rats using high-speed chronoamperometry, an electrochemical detection technique. The first exposure to either stress reliably and consistently elevated DA levels in the extracellular space of NAcc, PFC, and STR; the increases observed in PFC were of a greater magnitude than those observed in NAcc and STR. These data are consistent with those of previous studies suggesting a higher responsiveness of the meso-PFC system to stress. However, with repeated exposure increases in DA levels elicited by restraint became progressively larger in NAcc, and to a lesser extent also in STR, but not in PFC. Apomorphine, injected at autoreceptor selective doses, attenuated tail pinch and restraint stimulated increases in DA levels in NAcc but not in PFC, a finding consistent with the drug's action on impulse-modulating receptors of meso-NAcc DA neurons and with the known absense of such receptors on meso-PFC DA neurons. That DA was the primary contributor to the electrochemical signals was confirmed by the potentiating effect of GBR-12909, a selective DA uptake inhibitor, on restraint-elicited electrochemical responses in PFC and NAcc. Taken together, the results of the present study indicate that with repeated exposure the meso-NAcc DA response to subsequent exposure to stress is enhanced. The data indicate that this pathway, which is thought to mediate the positive reinforcing effects of rewards, is also activated during behaviors motivated by aversive stimuli.</description><creator>Doherty, Michael, 1964-</creator><contributor>Gratton, Alain (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><subject>Psychology, Psychobiology.</subject><title>Effects of repeated stress on mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic neurons : in vivo voltammetric studies</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hd76s1398.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kh04dq83b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychiatry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:000001252</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:56:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Two separate field studies were conducted to examine the predictions of the multidimensional anxiety theory with both elite able-bodied basketball players and elite wheelchair basketball players. A secondary purpose of this study was to examine the influence of functional classification on cognitive and somatic anxiety and self-confidence in wheelchair athletes. In experiment one, twelve collegiate basketball players completed the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 (CSAI-II) prior to each of nine league games and in experiment two, thirty-one elite wheel chair basketball players completed the CSAI-II prior to each of three tournament games. Results were analyzed in both field studies using the intraindividual procedures recommended by Sonstroem and Bernado (1982) and separate polynomial trend analyses were used to test the predictions of multidimensional anxiety theory. Results did not provide statistical support for multidimensional anxiety theory in that there were no reliable trends between cognitive anxiety, somatic anxiety, self-confidence and basketball performance in both field studies. In experiment two, results indicated that no significant differences in cognitive anxiety, somatic anxiety and self-confidence occurred as a function of wheelchair classification.</description><creator>Perreault, Stéphane, 1965-</creator><contributor>Marisi, D.

The goal of the study was to evaluate its potential in clinical situations, with the purpose of complementing or replacing the old fluoroscopic system available at the moment. The core of our study was to image 18 surgical specimens with gastrointestinal pathology utilizing 3 different techniques: high resolution shielded-cabinet, the Siemens digital system and the conventional analog hard copy system. A skin dose exposure test was conducted by the department with the purpose of assessing the benefits of both the digital and the conventional systems. We concluded in this study that the many advantages of the digital system--lower skin exposure, image reconstruction and manipulation, fast access to images, overcome its inferior resolution as compared with the analog hard-copy generation system.</description><creator>Cordovez-Stanziola, Rosana</creator><contributor>Bret, Patrice (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Health Sciences, Radiology.</subject><title>Comparative study between digital and conventional radiology in gastrointestinal pathology</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gx41mk25c.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7d278v30h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Diagnostic Radiology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:d791sh486</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:56:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><creator>Partelpoeg, E.

The primary objective of this study was to identify factors which predict subsequent PPS. Among patients with prior polio, cases were those with new weakness and fatigue, and controls were those without these complaints. A chart review of 353 patients evaluated at the Montreal Neurological Institute post-polio clinic identified 127 cases and 39 controls. In univariate analyses, significant risk factors for PPS were a greater current age (odds ratio of 1.8 per decade, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 2.6), a longer time since acute polio (odds ratio of 1.6 per decade, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.3), more weakness at acute polio (odds ratio 1.5, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.0), a recent weight gain (odds ratio 3.8, 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 9.4), muscle pain with exercise (odds ratio 3.8, 95% confidence interval 1.5 to 9.5), muscle pain (odds ratio 2.6, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 5.5), and joint pain (odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 5.3). The multivariate analyses revealed that a model containing current age (odds ratio 1.7 per decade, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.6), weakness at acute polio (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.5), muscle pain with exercise (odds ratio 4.9, 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 15.6), recent weight gain (odds ratio 6.4, 95% confidence interval 2.02 to 20.3), and joint pain (odds ratio 2.33, 95% confidence interval 0.8 to 7.1) was the most effective in predicting who would develop PPS. Age at acute polio, degree of recovery after polio, weakness at best point after polio, physical activity, and sex were not contributing factors.</description><creator>Trojan, Daria A.

The suspension was held in a vertical 5-cm diameter column between two platinum mesh electrodes, an upper anode and a lower cathode. Suspensions were prepared with CaCl$ sb2$ in distilled water at concentrations up to 10$ sp{-2}$ M. The initial solid content was between 9.1 and 15 wt% for Bentonite and between 25 and 45 wt% for kaolin and red clay. The initial bed height ranged from 0.5 to 2 cm. Constant voltages from 2.75 to 5.0 V and constant currents from 30 to 90 mA were used. In the interrupted regime the off-time ranged from 0.5 to 20 s with the on-time fixed at 30 s. A short circuit or an open circuit was applied during the off-time. The interrupted process with a short circuit was also applied at the end of a DC run when dewatering had stopped. Electroosmosis removed 20-70% of the water with an energy expenditure well below the heat of vaporization. The water removal rates were increased by the addition of CaCl$ sb2$. Beds of 0.5 cm thick were dewatered faster and with less energy consumption than thicker beds. Interruption with a short circuit applied during a 0.5 s off-time removed about 20-40% more water than DC for equal energy consumption. Interruption at the end of a DC run removed nearly the same amount of water as interruption applied from the beginning of a run. Relative motion between the electrodes in the form of rotation of the upper electrode at 40 or 70 rpm had no significant effect on dewatering. The Helmholtz/Smoluchowski theory did not agree with the experiment results for the effects of interruption in power and electrolyte content.</description><creator>Rabie, Hamid Reza</creator><contributor>Mujumdar, A.

Three footprinted sequences were detected on the non-coding strand of the $-$245 to +84 mdr1 promoter fragment (between -77 to -56, between -46 to -24, and between +5 and +15) with nuclear extracts from mdr1 expressing cells (CMT-93, LTA, and Y-1 cells). In addition, a specific footprinted sequence ($-$14 to +5) was detected on both strands only with nuclear extracts from the mdr1 non-expressing cell line (RAG cells) suggesting the presence and binding of a putative negative regulatory factor in these cells. However, replacement of this sequence in the mdr1 basal promoter ($-$93 to +84) by a heterologous, although similar positioned SV40 sequence did not restore promoter activity in RAG cells. The basal mdr1 promoter was further characterized in bidirectional deletion mutants, in order to identify cis-acting elements important for general transcriptional regulation.

In this study I have examined the effects of chemical agents on dystrophin accumulation in culture, as well as determined whether dystrophin in culture has associations with glycoproteins in a similar fashion to that found in normal muscle tissue. My results show that the onset of detectable dystrophin accumulation occurs shortly after myoblast fusion has taken place, and increases rapidly thereafter as a percentage of total cell protein. The effects of depolarizing concentrations of potassium ion, resulting in the inhibition of myotube contraction, are negligible, consistent with the fact that dystrophin is a cytoskeletal protein. I have found that 5-bromo-2$ sp prime$-deoxyuridine, known to affect terminal differentiation in myoblasts, markedly inhibits dystrophin accumulation in culture. Finally, I have found that dystrophin in cultured cells associates with Wheat Germ Agglutinin-binding proteins, as reported for adult skeletal muscle tissue, implying that the expression of these glycoproteins either precedes or occurs coordinately with dystrophin expression in culture.</description><creator>Ajdukovic, Boris</creator><contributor>Holland, Paul C.

Modern feminist criticism and research have tried to dispel some of the old illusions, and so they offer a fresh approach to evaluating the personal and social implications of gender in the Renaissance. Such perspectives can be specifically applied for enhanced appreciation of Spenser's Faerie Queene, after an initial assessment of Renaissance patriarchy itself. The Faerie Queene, we find, questions many important conventions of gender roles in Renaissance patriarchal society. Spenser crosses the familiar boundaries of appropriate or accepted female social status and options, and situates both males and females in roles which seemingly challenge the existing conventions by advancing the possibility of a new perspective. Spenser examines femininity from a specifically feminine point of view and invites a broadened understanding of the feminine. He portrays many different aspects of femininity and his titular heroine, Britomart, approximates the modern androgyne. The poem suggests a variety of alternative gender roles for both females and males, and also uses symbolic aspects of gender, so that characters ultimately cease to be gender-specific in their significance. That too tends to soften distinctions between males and females, by allegorically representing the self in such a way that it is seen to have both masculine and feminine aspects. Spenser's attempt to broaden his readers' understanding and valuation of the feminine and his suggestions of alternative roles for both genders, helped open the door to new freedom and equality for women by inviting redefinition or revision of culturally received notions of gender and its personal and social implications.</description><creator>Danker, Jennifer</creator><contributor>Borris, Kenneth (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Spenser, Edmund, 1552?-1599.

Only minor amounts (6%) are attributed to contour current activity and related processes. Eight sedimentary facies were differentiated which include (1) hemipelagic (H); (2) hemipelagic (HI) with ice-rafted detritus (IRD); (3) debris-flow deposits (subfacies D1, D2, D3), spill-over turbidite (T), headspill turbidite (TH), turbidite (TI) alternating with IRD; and (4) contourite (C) and nepheloid-flow deposits (N). Six major glacial advances were identified in Mid- to Late-Wisconsinan (64-10 ka) slope sediments by 6 very dark hemipelagic units containing abundant sinistral-coiling, cold-water foraminifera. The associated ice-retreat phases are characterized by the occurrence of turbidites, debris-flow deposits, nepheloid-flow deposits, and ice-rafted debris (IRD).</description><creator>Wang, Dong, 1963-</creator><contributor>Hesse, Reinhard (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Geology.</subject><subject>Hydrology.</subject><title>Continental-slope sedimentation adjacent to an ice-margin, Labrador sea : depositional facies and glacial cycles</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5h73px257.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0z708x90s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8p58pf169</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:56:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Digestion of titaniferous slag (Sorelslag) with sulphuric acid was studied in an effort to optimise the process and develop a better understanding of its chemistry. Thermodynamic analysis of the digestion reaction was performed using the program F*A*C*T. A laboratory reactor was built to simulate the operation of an industrial slag digestion reactor. Microstructure examinations of digestion samples revealed the main phases present. Statistically designed experiments using the Box-Behnken technique were performed in the laboratory to correlate the responses (digestion yield, maximum temperature, solidification time, degree of Ti$ sb2$O$ sb3$ oxidation, sulphuric acid loss in the gas, active acid/titanium ratio and cake height) to the four experimental variables (particle size of the slag, acid concentration, acid/slag weight ratio and baking time). Model equations successfully tested were obtained for each response. The analysis of the figures obtained from those equations revealed the relative importance of the variables evaluated. In complement to these experimental results the qualitative mass and heat balances were calculated.</description><creator>Turgeon, Jean-François</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Digestion of titaniferous slags with sulphuric acid</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tm70mw49q.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8p58pf169</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2r36tz85z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:56:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis, approximations and asymptotic expansions to the distribution of quadratic and bilinear forms in normal random variables are discussed.

It was hypothesized that (a) sexual satisfaction would be positively related to masculinity and femininity, as defined by the presence of instrumental and expressive qualities, for both males and females, (b) sexual satisfaction would be positively related to androgyny for both males and females, and (c) couples consisting of two androgynous partners would be more sexually satisfied than couples where both partners were sex-typed (i.e., masculine male-feminine female), cross-typed (i.e., feminine male-masculine female) or undifferentiated. The sample consisted of heterosexual married and cohabiting couples (N = 93). Subjects completed the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (MCSD; Crowne &amp; Marlowe, 1960, cited in Robinson, Shaver &amp; Wrightman, 1991), the Short Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI; Bem, 1981), the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS; Spanier, 1976, 1989) and the Pinney Sexual Satisfaction Inventory (PSSI; Pinney, Gerrard &amp; Denney, 1987). The first hypothesis is rejected for both males and females, the second hypothesis is supported for males and rejected for females, and the third hypothesis is supported for couples. Instrumentality is negatively correlated with sexual satisfaction, particularly for women, while expressivity is positively correlated with sexual satisfaction for both men and women. Androgynous men and feminine women are more sexually satisfied than any other group; in both cases however, it is suggested that increments in expressivity account for increases in sexual satisfaction. Androgynous couples are more sexually satisfied than sex-typed, cross-typed, and undifferentiated couples; however, self-reported sexual satisfaction varies for individual partners. Implications for the existing androgyny model regarding sexual satisfaction are discussed.</description><creator>Marchese, Sara</creator><contributor>Maroun, Ted (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Sex</subject><subject>Sex role</subject><title>The relationship between gender roles and sexual satisfaction in heterosexual relationships /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9306t049x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dn39x257g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0z708x92b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:56:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In what follows I examine problems surrounding Barbara Herrnstein Smith's relativist conception of value in her book Contingencies of Value: Alternative Perspectives for Critical Theory. I begin by showing how her conception of value is comprised of two distinct philosophical claims: the first axiological and the second epistemological. She first presents an anti-objectivist argument for axiological relativism which is quite tenable. She then tries to gain further support for this position by putting forth a version of epistemological relativism, a move which not only fails, but if true would undermine even her relativist axiology. Once I have shown her constructivist position to be misleading, if not incoherent, I then reconsider what her axiological position would look like if it had the support of a more tenable epistemology. I therefore offer a conception of value, borrowed from Paul Grice's The Conception of Value and Allan Gibbard's Wise Choices, Apt Feelings, which argues from a realist epistemology yet accepts a significant degree of axiological relativism.</description><creator>Doucette, Martin</creator><contributor>Livingston, Paisley (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Values</subject><subject>Smith, Barbara Herrnstein.

The concept of pleasure is applied to soap opera narrative, characters, visual style and viewing attitudes. Three soap operas, The Young and the Restless, General Hospital, and Another World, are described in detail according to these various types of pleasures. The Young and the Restless is a soap that relies largely on visual pleasures and melodrama. General Hospital's strongest pleasures are related to its character development and use of humour. Another World, the most traditional of the three soaps, is best at stimulating the pleasures associated with talk. Through analysis of viewer commentary supplied by letters sent to Soap Opera Weekly and Soap Opera Update and Nielsen ratings, it can be concluded that the pleasures that most soap opera viewers seem to value the most are related to visual style, romance and a delicate balance between realistic characters and fantasy in narrative.</description><creator>De Montigny, Michelle C.

Culture and religion, according to him, are inseparable in the definition of being an Iranian. It is possible to face the external enemy, only when the convergence of tradition and modernity takes place. The intellectuals, according to him, are the prophets of the modern age who have to call upon the Rowhaniyat, to make a coalition against the authocratic state and in favor of emancipation of the masses from their illusion which is caused by the impact of the West on Iran. Thus, according to him, any politico-cultural frontier has to merge with tradition. The representatives of tradition, Rowhaniyat, are the corner stones to any social reform in Iran. According to him it is only through the unity between the intellectuals and the Rowhaniyat that the real unity of the country is possible.</description><creator>Moulavi Pour, Hussain</creator><contributor>Adams, Charles J.

The mode aimed by this study is the "integrated" distribution. It brings together a manufacturer and merchants who are linked by contract. The object of the latter is to oblige the merchants to buy, exclusively or not, the manufacturer's goods for reselling on their behalf. This resale is organized by the manufacturer who dictates to them the obligations concerning the sale and the maintenance of the goods. Those obligations engender contractual relationships on a regular basis between the parties which are essential for the commercial survival of the resalers. In fact, the latter put their enterprise of distribution at the manufacturer's disposal. Thus, the parties adhere to a same procedure of distribution because the manufacturer can follow his goods from the production to the consumption stage. The preliminary chapter of this thesis specifies and elaborates the terminology in Quebec Law on the usual terms relative to those contracts. This was rendered necessary because of the influence of American terminology on the subject. This work naturally led to an historic overview of the contracts of integrated distribution in five major juridical systems: United States, England, Canada, France and Quebec. The first chapter's purpose is to establish a classification of those contracts which are proteiforms. To this end, we used two types of criterion of classification, namely the economical criteria and the juridical criteria. The economical criteria will study the economic activity aimed by those contracts and the form of economic concentration which they represent. Our juridical criteria will analyse the clause of exclusivity and the clause of control. Having thus established the criteria of classification, we will then, in a second chapter, examine the obligational content of the contracts of integrated distribution. These can be divided in two main categories according to whether they possess or not a clause of territoriality. Contracts that do not have a clause of territoriality can be divided between those which have or do not have the exclusivity of supply.</description><creator>Laprise, Gisèle</creator><contributor>Crepeau, Paul-Andre (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Law.</subject><subject>Business Administration, Management.</subject><title>Contrats de distribution intégrée : classification et contenu</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d791sh51h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fj2363277</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):27225</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
