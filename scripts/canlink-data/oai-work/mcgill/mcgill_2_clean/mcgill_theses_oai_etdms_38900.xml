Chromosome replication is restricted to the stalked cells where it initiates exactly once per cell cycle. To better understand the DNA sequence requirements for chromosome replication, I systematically altered the cloned chromosome replication origin (Cori), and assayed these mutations in a Cori-plasmid context and in a whole chromosome context. Previous studies implicated the cell cycle transcription regulator (CtrA) in multiple cell cycle events. CtrA is also proposed to regulate chromosome replication by binding five sites (a-e) inside Cori. Altered CtrA binding sites were assayed. CtrA protein failed to bind one mutant (in CtrA site d), and this mutation significantly increased the number of Cori-plasmids per cell. Other CtrA binding site mutations decreased plasmid copy number. To reveal the essential Cori DNA sequences that operate on the chromosome, and not just on a plasmid, 17 mutations throughout the Cori region were introduced into the chromosome by homologous recombination.

The crude extract (FI), obtained by cell homogenization, was partially purified by heat treatment (FII) and ultrafiltration (FIII). Further purification of the Cu-MT extract by affinity chromatography resulted in three major fractions, FIVa, FIVb and FIVc, of which fraction FIVc was considered to be the Cu-MT extract fraction. Fraction FIVc was re-chromatography on affinity chromatography and the eluted fraction showed a single peak (FIVc'). Spectrophotometric analysis of fraction FIVc' demonstrated a maximum absorption peak at 268 nm. Native and denatured electrophoretic analysis of fraction FIVc ' showed the presence of a single band with an estimated molecular weight of 9.5 and 10.0 kDa, respectively. Inhibition of mushroom tyrosinase (PPO) by the Cu-MT extracts was investigated, using selected phenolic substrates, including catechin, chlorogenic acid, catechol, 4-methylcatechol, caffeic acid, L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3-( p-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid, p-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid, p- and m-cresol. The results showed that the inhibitory effect of the Cu-MT extract increased with the degree of purification. The results revealed that the Cu-MT extracts were effective inhibitors of PPO activity and the best inhibitory effect was demonstrated with catechin as substrate; however, PPO activity was not inhibited by the Cu-MT extract when p-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid and p- and m-cresol were used as substrates. The results also showed that the Cu-MT extracts exhibited different types of inhibition, including mixed, competitive and uncompetitive on PPO activity. In addition, the experimental findings indicated that the nature and degree of enzymatic inhibitions by the Cu-MT extracts were dependent upon the structural nature of the substrates as well as the methods including, spectrophotometer and polarograph, used for the detection of enzyme</description><creator>Hossain, Abzal.</creator><contributor>Kermasha, Selim (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Polyphenol oxidase -- Inhibitors.</subject><subject>Aspergillus niger.</subject><subject>Metallothionein.</subject><subject>Enzymatic browning.</subject><title>Inhibition of tyrosinase activity by metallothionein from Aspergillus niger</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2801pj25c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nv9354878</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:tt44pp96v</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>I investigated the impacts of a catastrophic ice storm on the old-growth, hardwood forests of Mont St. Hilaire, Quebec. The mass of litter resulting from the ice storm of January 1998 was estimated using equations relating the basal diameter of fallen branches with branch mass for each of the ten major species. The ice storm of January 1998 produced 19.9 metric tonnes or 33.6 m3 of woody-litter per hectare. These losses of woody biomass are approximately 20 times greater than what is expected in a normal year and correspond to between 7--10% of the total above-ground biomass of the prestorm forest. This level of litter production positions the ice storm of 1998 as the most severe ice storm on record and amongst the most powerful forms of climatic disturbance experienced in forested ecosystems. I also investigated differences in the magnitude and nature of the biomass losses sustained by each study species. While the magnitude of biomass lost by the study species was not related to either wood strength or stiffness, the nature of the biomass lost was. All species primarily lost branches less than 5 cm in diameter, but it was the relatively few branches greater than this diameter that accounted for the majority of downed biomass. Smaller branches were lost in relation to differences in species-specific mechanical properties, while larger branches appear to be lost in response to weakening by decay and other age-dependent factors. The ecological and evolutionary implications of these results emphasise the need for an analysis of the interplay between mechanical properties and canopy architecture in determining overall susceptibility to ice damage.</description><creator>Hooper, Michael Craig.</creator><contributor>Lechowicz, Martin J.

Non-fluent and fluent aphasic patients and age-matched control subjects performed an auditory lexical decision task in three separate experimental subtests: semantic priming (e.g., manner-way), minimally-distinct mediated priming (e.g., nanner-way), and maximally-distinct mediated priming (e.g., zanner-way). Consistent with expectations, the findings revealed semantic priming effects in all groups. Interestingly, contrary to predictions based on previous studies, both non-fluent and fluent aphasic patient groups demonstrated mediated priming in both the minimally-distinct and the maximally-distinct subtests that was comparable to mediated priming effects shown by the normal control subjects. The results are discussed in light of current hypotheses concerning the nature of lexical access impairments in brain-damaged individuals. In addition, implications for models of normal word recognition are considered.</description><creator>Hutner, Jennifer S.</creator><contributor>Baum, Shari R.

The alpha radiation from such particles produces a cluster of tracks on the surface of an etched nuclear track detector, CR-39. The number of tracks in a cluster, as well the diameter of the cluster, are dependent on several factors: the diameter of the hot particle, the distance between the particle and the CR-39 surface, the composition of the particle, and the alpha-particle energy. The dependence of the alpha-emitting particle size and the number of registered tracks were revealed, and produced predictions of the track density distribution observed on the CR-39 plastic. There is a good fit between the simulation of track density observed on the CR-39 and the tracks arising from uranium oxide and plutonium oxide particles.</description><creator>Hegyi, Gyorgy.</creator><contributor>Richardson, Richard (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Physics, Radiation.</subject><title>Particle size determination for alpha-emitters using CR-39</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z890rw38j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1831cm824</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hm50tt50k</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Although clinical heterogeneity of schizophrenia has been well established, attempts to account for variance in clinical measures, with environmental risk factors, have been limited. Previous studies failed to examine numerous course and outcome measures within the context of multiple risk factors, within one sample. The goal of this study was to examine the role of three environmental risk factors (birth season, prenatal maternal stress and obstetric complications (OCs)) in explaining heterogeneity in clinical measures in a single sample. Our results suggest the three risk variables are independent of one another. Our findings also consistently implicated summer-fall birth season with poor premorbid adjustment, and with greater negative symptomatology. A causal model with birth season, social problems, onset of prodrome and negative symptoms found both summer-fall birth and earlier onset of prodrome to directly predict greater negative symptoms. Summer-fall birth season also predicted earlier onset of prodrome, via greater childhood social problems.</description><creator>Cunningham, Helen, 1973-</creator><contributor>King, Suzanne (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Psychology, Clinical.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Mental Health.</subject><title>Environmental factors in the etiology of schizophrenia : relation to course and outcome</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mc87ps36r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hm50tt50k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychiatry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6d56zz47w</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis reports the results of genetic and molecular analysis of polytene region 38 of D. melanogaster. A detailed genetic map of the region has been constructed through the complementation analysis of 22 genes with 37 deficiency stocks, providing 48 breakpoints. 44 of the breakpoints have been precisely mapped and separate the complementation groups into 16 distinct intervals. Molecular characterisation was achieved using a combination of computational sequence analysis and experimental techniques. In this manner, 46 new transcription units and their developmental expression patterns were identified and the physical location of 7 deficiency breakpoints revealed. Links have been established between the genetic and the physical maps using STSs and sequence information from previously cloned genes. This allowed the possible correlation of 4 previously genetically defined genes to their transcription units.</description><creator>Butler, Heather.</creator><contributor>Lasko, P.

These direct isometries can be derived from simpler forms known as quaternions and dual quaternions. Combining them with Hermann Grassmann's Extension Principle, the IK of serial manipulators is formulated entirely in projective geometry free of any metric. The only rules governing this geometry is the preservation of ratios and incidence. Actually, the holonomicity of these IK problems can be described using incidence relations alone. The algebraic constraints, derived from incident relations, define a manifestly holonomic system as opposed to general holonomic systems that need only satisfy Frobenius' Theorem for integrability using Pfaffian forms. The solution to these algebraic equations will require an introduction to algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. Definitions of basic geometric and algebraic objects along with a study of their respective properties are included. Pertinent theorems are proved and illustrated with simple examples to establish a dictionary between algebra and geometry. By this means, kinematic analysis is conveniently subjected to the theories of algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. More precisely, the inverse kinematics (IK) of a 6R serial manipulator (6Rsm) is formulated in the homogeneous projective space of dual quaternions (DQ). This leads to a robust algorithm because the 8-space of DQ together with the Grassmannian extension ensures that only valid solutions, which satisfy all of the constraint equations, are admitted. Numerical examples, based on two real 6Rsm architectures, are presented to illustrate the efficacy of the new algorithm. Its fiber (solutions) and critical loci (singularities) are described.</description><creator>Gervasi, Pasquale.</creator><contributor>Zsombor-Murray, Paul J.

Although much theoretical and experimental work has contributed to a good understanding of the short-term dynamics of tethered systems, their long-term behaviour remains unexplored. Hence, a detailed mathematical model and a software have been developed to analyse the long-term effect of the low Earth orbit environment on tethered systems. The software predicts the trajectory and the attitude of the system, as well as the temperature and the longitudinal vibrations of the tether. The program accounts for the effects of atmospheric lift and drag, asphericity of the Earth (zonal and sectorial harmonics), solar and Earth radiation, electromagnetic forces, lunisolar attraction, and material damping. The thesis reviews previous research work in the field and extends it using more detailed models of external perturbations. Particular attention is given to the three major external forces influencing the dynamics of tethered systems: atmospheric forces, Earth oblateness effects, and electromagnetic forces. Furthermore, analytical solutions are provided for the problem of atmospheric drag induced shift of the equilibrium angle. It was noted that the present formulation can predict the long-term motion of non-conductive librating tethered systems (such as TiPS) with greater accuracy than previous models. The simulation software is also used to study the behaviour of spinning and conductive systems. The results show that bare conductive tethers can decay the orbit of spent rocket stages or dysfunctional satellites over 100 kg at a lower "weight cost" than traditional rocket systems and much faster than atmospheric drag.</description><creator>Lanoix, Eric LM.</creator><contributor>Misra, Arun K.

This was determined through weight gain studies using a thermogravimetric balance, microscopic examination of sample surfaces and cross-sections, and chemical analysis of the phases formed during oxidation. The addition of 12% silicon to aluminum promoted the formation of alpha-alumina nodules on the sample surface at 800°C by reducing the viscosity of the molten metal to allow for better feeding of fresh metal through cracks in the top oxide. Strontium was found to prevent the formation of oxide nodules in an Al-12%Si alloy through the formation of a strontium containing oxide. Similarly, in a commercial 356 alloy, strontium greatly reduced the extent of oxidation by preventing the preferential oxidation of magnesium. It is believed that the mechanism responsible for this is also through the formation of a strontium containing oxide. Oxidation experiments conducted on an Al-3%Mg alloy revealed that magnesium preferentially oxidizes to form two oxides, firstly MgO, and secondly MgAl 2O4, which forms only from the reaction of MgO and aluminum. Weight gains for this alloy were greatly affected by the oxidizing temperature. Higher temperatures shortened the incubation time to breakaway oxidation and decreased the time required to oxidize all the magnesium from the alloy.</description><creator>Dennis, Keith.</creator><contributor>Gruzleski, J.

Improvement in powder production, cleanliness and characterization techniques, combined with an increased understanding of basic compaction and sintering principles and a need for metals with high strength to weight ratios has led to an increased interest in titanium powder utilization. P/M techniques for Ti-6Al-4V powder can enable the production of high quality parts at lower processing temperatures and cost. For most applications prealloyed powder produced by the hydride-dehydride process (HDH) is used, due to the lower cost of this powder as compared to Ti-6Al-4V powder produced by other methods. General characterization of a Ti-6Al-4V HDH powder and the effects of using a zinc stearate on the green and sintered density were examined at different compaction pressures and sintering temperatures.

The study took place in a private, Catholic all girls' school in an urban setting in the province of Quebec. Over the course of the four months spent in the research site, data was collected through observation, interviews and the collection of artefacts. The findings of this study suggest that Maude played three distinct leadership roles to which metaphoric labels were associated. She was a peacekeeper when assuming a socio-political stance, a gatekeeper when establishing and preserving the instructional standards of the school and a gardener when tending to the health of both individuals and the institution. Few studies have investigated how female principals lead their school and reach decisions. Much of the literature on leadership has focused on the male perspective. Only recently have researchers acknowledged the androcentric bias found in the leadership literature. This study provides an other perspective on leadership, a female perspective. As such, the emergent educational leadership framework takes into consideration the influence values, mainly attributed to women have on both leadership and decision-making. The framework proposed outlines the fluidity associated with leadership and decision-making when seen through a gendered filter.

This thesis focuses on agrodiversity and how peasant farmers build and maintain cultivated plant diversity in home gardens found in three distinct traditional communities along the Maranon river in the Peruvian Amazon---an upland mixed agricultural village, a lowland agricultural village, and a lowland fishing village. Data were gathered through household surveys (n = 192) and in-depth interviews (n = 112). Substantial variation in cultivated plant diversity was found among and within villages. Residents with the highest home garden agrodiversity tend to be among the wealthier households, and are more likely to have both established their own garden, and tended it for longer periods. Complex planting material exchange networks underlie the establishment and maintenance of home garden agrodiversity. The results underscore the importance of studying local variations in agricultural diversity, and exchange networks that bring agricultural planting stock to peasant farmers.</description><creator>Lerch, Natalie Corinna.</creator><contributor>Coomes, Oliver T.

This is accomplished by surveying of 'Ad and Thamud prior to Quṭb to show how great the shift of interpretation is between classical and modern exegetes. Furthermore, close reading of Fi ẓilal al-Qur'an is made in order to trace the significance of the two tales for Quṭb, as Quṭb's interpretation is not only a response to his predecessors but also to his contemporary milieu; which featured political, ideological and religious conflict. His experiences with the latter are reflected in his interpretation which follows the pattern of jahiliyah versus Islam, 'Ad versus Hud, and Thamud versus S&amp;dotbelow;alih&amp;dotbelow;. Hud and S&amp;dotbelow;alih&amp;dotbelow;, as prophets and callers to the truth, represent Quṭb himself, whereas 'Ad and Thamud, as challengers and evildoers, stand for his enemies; the West, its materialistic tendencies and the Egyptian government. In commenting on the ẓilal's hermeneutic, we will examine its systematization of the surahs and verses which contain these two tales as well as analyze Quṭb's argumentation, historical consciousness, hermeneutic, and personal judgement.</description><creator>Makin, Al.</creator><contributor>Boullata, Issa J.

This has had profound effects on its ensuing political patterns and political processes. This thesis describes how and why the politics of Northern Ontario are different. This thesis demonstrates that the politics of Northern Ontario, unlike Southern Ontario, are distinguished by disaffection, dependency, domination, pragmatism, and parochialism. This thesis also argues that the North's divergent development and natural resource based economy, as well as pernicious provincial government policies and extensive interventions, provoked the differences apparent in its politics. These differences are evinced in the North's disparate political culture, political priorities, and political structure. Furthermore, this thesis confirms that Northern Ontario politics feature a low level of political efficacy which is primarily the result of its "centre-periphery" connection with Southern Ontario.</description><creator>Martin, Charles, 1975-</creator><contributor>Maioni, Antonia (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Ontario -- Politics and government.</subject><subject>Ontario, Northern -- Politics and government.</subject><title>The politics of Northern Ontario : an analysis of the political divergences at the provincial periphery</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kd17cv88p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pv63g205n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:db78td996</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:36Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis deals with the rise of mystical movements (Aliran Kebatinan) in post-independence Indonesia, focusing on Susila Budhi Dharma (Subud), founded in 1925 by Muhammad Subuh. Despite that Subuh had been raised as a Javanese man and was heavily influenced by Javanese culture, he also learned from a Ṣufi master who introduced him to certain fundamental concepts of Islamic mysticism. The aim of this thesis is therefore to observe the possible influences on Subud doctrine from both Javanese and Islamic mystical traditions. The major themes of this thesis are three in number: first, to discuss the historical background of the emergence of mystical movements in Java, and to present two mystical movements; second, to give a brief account of Muhammad Subuh's biography and the basic concepts of Subud; and lastly, to analyze Subud theories and practices and see its relation to both Javanese and Islamic mystical traditions. This work also addresses the question of why this movement and other Aliran Kebatinan held such an appeal for Javanese and Westerners alike, and why they gave rise to such bitter polemic amongst Indonesian scholars. In the case of Subud the answer to both of these questions lies in its blend of Javanese and Islamic tradition, which attracted the spiritually inclined but at the same time not alienating the shari'a.</description><creator>Batubara, Chuzaimah.</creator><contributor>Federspiel, Howard M.

An excellent example is given by Vittorio Alfieri's Saul. This tragedy bases itself on the biblical story of the Hebrew king (I Samuel , 8--31), but focuses on the last hours of the protagonist, which makes it very difficult to identify Saul as a Krafkerl. Yet this is exactly the purpose of our study, which will begin by examining the critical history of the main character spanning nearly two centuries, then give the main characteristics of the Noble Outlaw as he appears in German literature, and conclude by showing how the character of Alfieri's Saul meets the profile of this protoromantic hero type; all this to strengthen the historical, albeit totally coincidental ties that bind Alfieri to his contemporaries of the Sturm und Drang preestablished at the beginning of our century by Benedetto Croce.</description><creator>Bassi, Umberto.</creator><contributor>Gilardino, Sergio Maria (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Alfieri, Vittorio, 1749-1803.

In contrast, domain general theories suggest that the abilities develop concurrently. To assess the relation between mental state reasoning and problem solving, children with autism, developmental delay, and typical development were administered 2 ToM tasks, and 3 problem solving tasks that did not require mental state reasoning. Typically developing children performed better than both groups on the problem solving tasks, each of which required the use of embedded rules. For all groups, positive within-group correlations emerged between the tasks that required mental state reasoning and the general problem solving tasks, suggesting that a common mechanism underlies both abilities, and challenging the notion of domain specificity. The current findings are discussed in the context of a domain general versus domain specific account of ToM acquisition in typical and atypical populations.</description><creator>Boseovski, Janet J.</creator><contributor>Burack, Jacob A.

The text I have chosen to study is the Memoires of Marguerite de Valois, begun in 1594 and published in 1628, thirteen years following the death of this queen. My analysis encompasses both the conventions of genre and rhetoric evidenced in the text. The first chapter explores the peculiarities inherent in the memoirs genre, especially where these explicitly distinguish it from the autobiography. The second chapter examines the rhetorical aspects of Marguerite de Valois' Memoires. In doing so, I have highlighted and analyzed the rhetorical strategies employed in the text, whose ultimate intent was to convince the initial reader, Brantome, and subsequently posterity, of the political astuteness of an author who was also worthy of her correspondent's trust as a loyal ally.</description><creator>Bergeron, Elise.</creator><contributor>Desrosiers-Bonin, Diane (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Marguerite, Queen, consort of Henry IV, King of France, 1553-1615.

In spite of the centrality of political considerations, it is important to look at the potential for trade and other transactions between the countries from a purely economic point of view. In this thesis candidates for trade in agricultural commodities between Syria and Israel are identified, assuming a normalization of relations between these two countries. The history of trade in the region, from the Roman Empire to the present time is described and analyzed with an emphasis on Israel and Syria. This is followed by an examination of relative resource endowments, and political, economic, and social development, with special attention to the agricultural and food sectors. Border trade analysis is used as a method for identifying commodities that are candidates for trade between Israel and Syria. In general, the method presumes that commodities that are sensitive to distance will be candidates for trade between neighboring countries. This sensitivity is assessed by an examination of border trade in a commodity compared to total trade in the same commodity, using data from a sample of countries. Commodities that tend to be traded between neighbors compared to between distant partners are assumed to have potential for trade between Israel and Syria. The results of the analysis yielded 10 agricultural commodities (SITC three digit level) that are likely to be traded between Israel and Syria. Moreover, the possible direction of trade in these commodities could also be identified.</description><creator>Hamze, Imad Abdul-Rahman.</creator><contributor>Coffin, Garth (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Syria -- Commerce -- Israel.</subject><subject>Produce trade -- Syria.</subject><subject>Israel -- Commerce -- Syria.</subject><subject>Produce trade -- Israel.</subject><title>Agricultural trade potential following peace in the Middle East : the case of Syria and Israel</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ng451k568.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0k225c93s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Agricultural Economics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:r781wh92h</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>On-line ultrasonic monitoring of conventional and gas-assisted injection molding processes, and temperature measurement using ultrasound, are carried out. A technique utilizing reflection coefficients obtained by a pulse/echo technique is established to monitor the local polymer melt arrival, end of filling, pressure overshoot, solidification, part detachment, plunger retraction, and part ejection in conventional injection molding. The same technique is applied to monitor additional process parameters such as the local gas arrival, start and end of gas injection, gas penetration, and gas blow-through in gas assisted injection molding. During solidification monitoring of a high-density polyethylene part, the solidification front is observed. Also the thickness of solidified layers is determined, and its application in obtaining temperature within the molded part is demonstrated. An approach to determine the local flow front speed of the molten polymer is also proposed. A high-performance buffer rod is fabricated and calibrated as a new type of ultrasonic temperature probe to measure temperature during the extrusion process. The temperature obtained using the ultrasonic technique is comparable with calibrated conventional thermocouples. Comparison between ultrasonic sensors and conventional pressure and temperature probes is also discussed in this study.</description><creator>Wen, Szu-sheng, 1971-</creator><contributor>Jen, Cheng-Kuei (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Plastics Technology.</subject><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Advances in on-line ultrasonic monitoring of injection molding process</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/70795959m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r781wh92h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qv33rz50z</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The objectives of this thesis were: (i) assess the role of indoor air pollutants and allergens with respect to their individual contribution to EIB and reported asthma in elementary schoolchildren in Montreal and Port Alberni; and (ii) to determine how the effect of these indoor environmental pollutants and allergens are modified by host factors, such as gender. The hypothesis was that increased levels of indoor allergens and pollutants are associated with a higher prevalence of asthma and/or EIB; this association being modified by gender. Initially a cross-sectional study was carried out of 989 Montreal elementary schoolchildren, and 1,785 Port Alberni elementary schoolchildren. A questionnaire was completed by the parents and exercise test was carried out in which the children performed spirometry before and after a free running exercise test. For the purpose of this thesis a sub-sample of 332 children from Montreal and 305 children from Port Alberni were combined and a more detailed case-control study pertaining to home environment carried out.

These solids report to a tailings pond for containment. Tailings pond life would be increased if the solids density of the precipitated solids was improved. Previous work at McGill University suggested that a staged neutralization process with solids recycle and seeded with gypsum would produce large-sized gypsum crystals with a high solids density. A continuous lab-scale process run with synthetic zinc plant effluent produced large (~100 mum) gypsum crystals with a solids density of 50 +/- 3%.
