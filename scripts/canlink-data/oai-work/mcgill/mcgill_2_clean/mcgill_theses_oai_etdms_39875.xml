In this thesis, a 3-step Nyquist rate ADC is presented which makes use of bitstream processing to calibrate the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and the residue amplifier, while using the same hardware to calibrate the sub-ADC. The system is designed to provide programmability and calibrate undesired circuit characteristics such as offset, gain error, and nonlinearity. Thus, the DAC can tolerate gain errors much higher than the standard amount, and has the potential to completely cancel nonlinearity and offsets in its transfer function. The offset of the residue amplifier can also be calibrated with this system. Moreover, the system eliminates the need for a reference ladder in the sub-ADC, and calibrates comparator offsets. Simulation and experimental results of the circuits fabricated in a 0.18mum CMOS process are presented.</description><creator>Pishdad, Bardia</creator><contributor>Roberts, G. W.

The approach aims to improve the material distribution of a formed thermoplastic part via better sheet temperature control prior to forming. Improved control of material distribution will increase part quality and result in fewer part rejects, thereby increasing production efficiency. A process model consisting of individual components describing sensor, heater, and sheet heating dynamics has been developed. Recommendations for improvements to the process model, particularly for the sheet heating model, are also made. An in-cycle control strategy is proposed and the feasibility of in-cycle sheet reheat temperature control is examined based on simulation results for multivariable Hinfinity control is examined based on simulation results for multivariable H infinity and MPC controller designs.</description><creator>Moore, Ben, 1977-</creator><contributor>Boulet, Benoit (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>In-cycle control of the thermoforming reheat process</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6m311r289.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wd375z26s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:m326m372t</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:59:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Most Romanian national heroes lived while the Ottoman Empire dominated the Balkans. History bears witness to their doings, yet certain figures have become almost mythical thanks to the powerful impact of the nationalistic literature. Mihai Eminescu, the Romanian national poet par excellence, whose writings were merely tolerated by the Communists, exerted a strong influence despite his passionate involvement and he managed to create historical confusion lasting for generations. After 1989, Romanian history books changed. In my thesis, I seek to modify the myth of invincible Romanian heroes and to understand the reason why Romanian principalities enjoyed a special treatment during the Ottoman period. The Romanian principalities served as buffer states, stopping, halting the Ottoman advancement to the north of the Danube on many occasions. The double game often used by Romanian leaders helped Valaquia and Moldavia retain their special status. Also, the treaties of vassalage signed with the Romanians and the power of the Orthodox Church have prevented the Ottomans from imposing their own laws and customs.

It is a work of art, an artwork. A common understanding of what art is and should be forms the background to the diverse works' heterogeneous forms of expression. Although the focus of this paper is on one of Hoffmann's Works, it reveals Hoffmann's ideas and ideals as a human being and romantic author, as well as his philosophical outlook on life ("Weltanschauung"). In Hoffmann's "The Devil's Elixirs," practically impossible events often serve a psychological function, by projecting the hero's internal processes externally and portraying mental or emotional events in realistic images. In his novel, the poet did not just seek to portray a psychological conflict, but rather to use the various means provided by his knowledge and imagination to write a captivating, interesting story, which also reflects his ideas and ideals. Hoffmann was not a psychologist, but rather a poet. He didn't write a medical case history, he wrote a novel. His experience and observations of the internal and external world of human beings served as a stimulus for literary creation, without being the sole theme of the artistic work.</description><creator>Nassiri, Massoud</creator><contributor>Schmidt, Josef (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Hoffmann, E.

Analyzing his three major novels published in the nineteen-nineties, as well as an earlier short story, the paper will discuss how Ge Fei renegotiates the status and place of the literary subject as configured through the act of writing, and its close relationship with the medium of memory and history. Contrary to the prevailing opinion, the avant-garde experiment in Ge Fei's works does not intimate the dissipation of the subject, but rather assists in reconfiguring it in an entirely new and dynamic conceptualization. Instead of a figural e/End and vulgarization of literature in the nineties, Ge Fei's experimentation with the acts of writing and reading, as well as his play with language, open up new possibilities for the writing of new literatures in contemporary China.</description><creator>Payne, Christopher Neil</creator><contributor>Button, Peter (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Chinese literature -- History and criticism -- Theory, etc</subject><subject>Chinese fiction -- History and criticism</subject><subject>Postmodernism (Literature) -- China</subject><subject>Experimental fiction -- China -- History and criticism</subject><title>Terminus intractable and the literary subject : deconstructing the endgame in Chinese avant-garde fiction</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pn89d846d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cn69m593p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of East Asian Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1z40kv730</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:59:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Bossuet's once-celebrated eloquence is now almost unknown; among those who felt his renown of yesteryear, very few will dare try to explain it. Marked simultaneously by the Council of Trent's resolutions inciting Christian orators to show more sobriety, and by the necessity to rouse an audience not much inclined to evangelical simplicity (the courtesans of Louis XIV), the rhetoric of funeral orations may well result from the skillful integration of rhetoric techniques that were once pagan to the Christian mindset. Bossuet taught a lesson in humility, modesty and piety, in a language that was bound to leave an imprint on the worldly; heroics, praise, moral portrait, epic tables and Cornelian vocabulary, usually destined for entertainment, were now used to convert: pagan techniques to save souls....

Phase I of the study involved a quantitative analysis of gambling attitudes among 1408 students from Elementary and Secondary Schools. Participants ranging from 8 to 20 years of age completed the Attitudes and Gambling Activities Questionnaire (AGAQ) and scaled questions designed to delineate the perceived degree of skill and luck involved in various gambling activities. The frequency and reasons youth engage in specific gambling activities and explored attitudes and their relationship to perceptions of perceived control over gambling outcomes. Results revealed age and gender related attitudes toward gambling that may increase their vulnerability to developing problem gambling were examined. Older youth expressed more tolerance of gambling activities while young children under-estimated the addictive nature of gambling and over-estimated the degree of control over gambling outcomes. Males expressed being less fearful of getting caught gambling and had much more tolerant attitudes toward gambling behaviors. Furthermore, those youth found to have a greater number of permissive and/or irresponsible attitudes also had greater misperceptions concerning the degree of skill involved in gambling. Phase II of the study elaborated upon quantitative findings through focus group analysis involving 59 participants in grades 4, 7, 9 and 11. Results expanded upon findings regarding youths' perceptions of gambling and attitudes towards gambling at school, and outline youths' understanding of responsible gambling. Findings are discussed in terms of their utility for youth problem gambling prevention programming and future directions for research are suggested.</description><creator>Dickson, Laurie Marie</creator><contributor>Derevensky, Jeffrey (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Gupta, Rina (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Youth</subject><subject>Gamblers</subject><subject>Teenage gamblers</subject><title>A developmental perspective of youth gambling attitudes : implications for prevention</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mp48sf536.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d187s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h702q817q</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:59:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The reason why I have studied the way Milan Kundera appeals to poetry inside his novels is that I did the opposite in my creative text by subjecting a poetic form to certain novelistic constraints such as narration, the presence of characters and the use of prose. Out of these constraints, the poetic obsession about images and shapes leads to a story. These four "Short geometrical proses" appear as "short stories" all of which tell a moment, a situation or the life of characters obsessed with geometrical figures such as the rectangle, the triangle, the square and the circle. This "nature of geometrical figures" brings forth sweet reveries which translate various feelings in a playful tone.</description><creator>Duchesne, Hugo</creator><contributor>Ricard, Francois (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Rivard, Yvon (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Kundera, Milan -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><subject>Poetry</subject><title>Petites proses géométriques, suivi de, La poésie au secours du roman</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vt150m019.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h702q817q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p2676x60g</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:59:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Baldassare Galuppi (1706--85), during the course of his compositional career, composed a number of settings of the Marian antiphon text " Salve Regina," of which only one choral and five solo settings survive. In this thesis Galuppi's compositional career is reviewed and the history of the Venetian ospedali, or orphanages, addressed, especially as it relates to the composer's tenure at the Ospedale di San Lazzaro dei Mendicanti and the Ospedale del Santissimo Salvatore degli Incurabili. Also, the importance of the Marian text itself is discussed in relation to Galuppi's works at the two institutions. The five solo settings for soprano and orchestra, two of which are securely dated, are examined individually and, based on stylistic considerations, given a tentative chronology. Problems of attribution for one of the settings are discussed in light of the discovery of a second manuscript source attributed to Giovanni Battista Borghi. Critical editions of the five solo settings are included.</description><creator>Day, Gary A.</creator><contributor>Cumming, Julie E.

The 4,200 hectare bog provides habitat to a large number of rare and endangered species and plays an integral role as a natural water filter. This study used the contingent valuation survey method to estimate respondents' willingness to pay for the preservation of the Alfred Bog wetland, which is threatened by the competing activities of drainage, burning, and the extraction of peat. A multiple bounded discrete choice model was used to analyze the survey results. Results indicated that respondents were willing to pay an average of $79.22, in the form of a one-time voluntary contribution to a hypothetical preservation fund, for the preservation of the Alfred Bog wetland. Conservation club membership, visits to the bog, donations to wetland preservation programs, attitudes, distance from the bog, household income, and education level were found to be important predictors of willingness to pay. Aggregate willingness to pay to preserve the bog was estimated to be between $2.2 million to $663,000 depending upon the inclusion or exclusion of protest bids. The survey results suggested that most of this value was nonuse value attributed to option, bequest, and altruistic values. Thus, the failure of policy makers and resource managers to consider nonuse values in decision making processes can understate the value of preserving the Alfred Bog.</description><creator>Tkac, Jennifer May</creator><contributor>Thomassin, Paul (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Contingent valuation -- Ontario.</subject><subject>Wetland conservation -- Ontario.</subject><title>Estimating willingness to pay for the preservation of the Alfred bog wetland in Ontario : a multiple bounded discrete choice approach</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bz60cz47g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k930c0126</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Agricultural Economics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xw42n981r</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:59:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The adenoviral Early Region 4 open reading frame 4 (E4orf4) protein has been shown to induce p53-independent apoptosis in transformed human cell lines. In rodent cells, E4orf4 has been shown to mediate apoptosis in the presence of a caspase inhibitor. These early results suggested that E4orf4 triggers a novel, non-classical form of apoptosis that may be independent of the core death machinery. A series of experiments were performed to analyze the activation of apoptotic machinery in response to the expression of E4orf4 in human cell lines. The analysis of E4orf4-induced cell death focused on a detailed examination of molecular mechanisms involved in the induction and execution of classical apoptosis. The results showed that E4orf4 induces moderate levels of cell killing of human cancer cells and causes some externalization of phosphatidylserine. However, E4orf4-mediated cell death is not associated with the activation of caspases or with the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Furthermore, poly(ADP-ribosyl) polymerase (PARP) is not proteolytically processed, mitochondrial membranes are not depolarized, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are not generated. Thus, E4orf4 seems to induce an aberrant type of apoptosis characterized by no apparent activation of the classic molecular apoptotic machinery.</description><creator>Szymborski, Adam</creator><contributor>Branton, Philip E.

This could be due to prenatal exposures to seasonally varying factors. Although winter-born and non-winter-born patients tend to differ in various aspects of the illness, associations between season of birth and premorbid adjustment (PMA) are unclear. Objectives. The main purpose of this study was to determine whether winter-born and non-winter-born schizophrenia patients differ in terms of PMA and to examine how family history may influence the association. A second objective was to determine which of the proposed underlying seasonal factor, and during which trimester of gestation, explains the most variance in PMA. Method. Data on four PMA dimensions (attention, internalising, externalising, and social) and family history were collected for 37 patients. Subject's prenatal exposure to sunshine, temperature, and influenza for each trimester of gestation was calculated. Results . Non-winter-birth and a positive family history of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders were associated with worse PMA. Prenatal exposure to both sunshine and temperatures during the first and third trimesters of gestation explained variance in particular PMA dimensions. Results suggest different mechanisms by which season of birth and family history interact in explaining distinct dimensions of PMA.</description><creator>St-Hilaire, Annie</creator><contributor>King, Suzanne (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Health Sciences, Mental Health.</subject><title>Explaining variance in the premorbid adjustment of Schizophrenia patients : the role of season of birth and family history</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t722hb67t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nc580p45h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychiatry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z890rw41v</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:59:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Transgenic mice lacking RPTPsigma, a type IIa receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase, exhibit severe neural-developmental deficits. Continued expression of RPTPsigma in the adult suggests that it plays a functional role in the mature nervous system. To determine if RPTPsigma might influence axonal regeneration, the time course of regeneration following facial nerve crush in wild type and RPTPsigma (-/-) mice was compared. Mice lacking RPTPsigma exhibited an accelerated rate of functional recovery, suggesting that RPTPsigma slows the extension of regenerating axons. We detected a decrease in RPTPsigma expression by facial motoneurons following nerve crush in wild type mice. Consistent with this, we show that the rate of axon extension is enhanced in neurons obtained from RPTPsigma (-/-) mice. Furthermore, in wild type mice. RPTPsigma is enriched in axonal growth cones. These findings indicate that RPTPsigma slows axon growth via a mechanism intrinsic to the neuron and identify a role for RPTPsigma in regulating axonal regeneration.</description><creator>Thompson, Katherine M.</creator><contributor>Kennedy, Timothy E.

Daycare centres play a role in hepatitis A infection epidemiology; however, there is little information on this infection among daycare educators in Canada. Objective. To determine hepatitis A seroprevalence and risk factors among daycare educators. Methods. Directors and educators from randomly selected daycare centres in Montreal completed questionnaires on daycare-level and educator-level characteristics. Sera were collected during on-site visits. Results. The seroprevalence of hepatitis A among the 492 participating educators was 35.6% (15.9% among Canadian-born educators). Risk factors included: region of birth by income-level (OR = 20.8; 95% CI: 9.4, 46.0); report of previous hepatitis A vaccination (OR = 6.1; 95% CI: 2.9, 13.0); travel to endemic areas (OR = 2.4; 95% CI: 1.3, 4.2); and age (OR5-yr = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.3, 1.7). For Canadian-born educators, a further association was found between seropositivity and years worked in daycare (OR5-yr = 1.3; 95% CI: 1.0, 1.8). Conclusion. In a non-outbreak situation, daycare educators share similar risk factors for seropositivity with the general population. Canadian-born educators appear to be placed at additional risk by working in daycare centres, and may benefit from vaccination.</description><creator>Muecke, Cristin J.</creator><contributor>Gyorkos, Theresa W.

The sulfurizing reagent "EDITH" allowed for the synthesis of the diastereomeric mixture of dimers with minimal formation of oxidized side products. The separation of the two isomers was carried out using silica gel flash chromatography to afford the stereoisomerically pure Rp and S p dimers. The orthogonal solution-phase coupling of the individual dimers to the appropriately protected monomers allowed for the creation of the corresponding branched trimers bearing vicinal 2',5'-phophorothioate and 3',5'-phosphodiester linkages. Conversely, a convergent solid-phase strategy applicable to the synthesis of branched oligonucleotides was employed to construct a symmetrical branched phosphodiester trimer, A(pG)pG, using an adenosine bisphosphoramidite synthon. This compound served as a positive control substrate, relative to both the Sp and Rp-phophorothioate V-trimers, in the investigation of the stereochemical requirements of the yeast debranching enzyme (yDBR) at the 2',5'-phosphodiester linkage.

Two approaches are tested thoroughly. The first is to use forced convection to heat the sample. This is tested experimentally up to about 500 K with 1.5 mm thick samples and theoretical calculations are used to resolve these data and to predict the behaviour of the thin ribbons at higher temperatures. The results show that the ideal configuration for this heating mechanism involves heating the ends of the samples while allowing hot gas to flow over the surface. Despite its expected advantages, such as small thermal gradients within the sample, this system should have poor long term stability and require a difficult calibration in order to couple the gas heater to the heaters at the ends of the sample.

We represent vortex filaments as thin tubes on a 3D-grid and use a Lagrangian vortex filament method to describe their motion within a level set framework. We thus obtain a hybrid method that incorporates the accuracy of vortex methods in modelling filament motion and the benefits of working on a fixed grid within the level set framework. These benefits include a general grid characterization of the topological changes that, may occur and natural filtering of high-frequency perturbations. We have validated the consistency of the hybrid method reproducing the motion of well studied configurations of vortex filaments. More importantly, we have demonstrated the capability of this hybrid method to simulate the reconnection of vortex filaments for a number of examples, including the reconnection subsequent to the head-on collision of two sinusoidally perturbed circular filaments. To our knowledge, these are the first results illustrating the use of a hybrid Level-Set Lagrangian framework to model and simulate the reconnection of vortex filaments in an inviscid fluid.</description><creator>Ghuneim, Abeer George</creator><contributor>Siddiqi, Kaleem (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Cortelezzi, Luca (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>A level set vortex hybrid method for simulating the motion of vortex filaments /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0p0969111.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cz30pv51q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pg15bh02t</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:59:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>I examined the kinetic properties of macroscopic and single channel currents produced by an isoform of the rat CaV3.1 T-type voltage-gated calcium channel, expressed in HEK-293 cells. Whole cell currents were measured in 2 mM extracellular Ca2+, and single channel activity was recorded from cell-attached patches in 120 mM Ba2+. We found that macroscopic rates of activation, deactivation, inactivation, and recovery from inactivation each have voltage-dependent and voltage-independent components. Single channels opened and closed rapidly in bursts before inactivating, with a mean open time of 1 ms, a mean intra-burst close time of 0.3 ms, and a mean burst duration of 5.5 ms. The conductance of these openings was 4.4 pS. We also observed occasional larger and smaller openings that may indicate subconductance states. These data will further contribute to the understanding of the biophysical function and diversity of this calcium channel isoform.</description><creator>Foster, Nicholas E.

Validation was carried out through a chart review of a sample of BC decedents extracted from a tumor registry. The algorithm was then applied to the decedents of a cohort of women with BC. The three groups were compared for their distributions of age and place of death. The validation showed an excellent crude agreement (0.96). Of the 3334 deaths, 2293 were classified as were dying of, 142 as died of, and 949 as died with. The comparison of age showed that women who died with were older than women who were dying of.

This study aimed to assess SIT acceptability and to determine factors associated with the willingness of public injectors to use SIF in a city considering their establishment. From April 2001--February 2002, qualitative, key informant interviews and survey data collection methods were employed. Questions were appended to a study monitoring HIV risk among Montreal IDU. Univariate and bivariate analyses preceded logistic regression. 11 key informants and 251 IDU participated in the study. Key informants generated specific SIT models subsequently presented to IDU. Overall, SIF acceptability was high. Two logistic regression models presented factors independently predictive of potential SIF use including drug use characteristics and SIF attributes. Initial community and user consultations are essential in assessing relevance and planning of SIF.</description><creator>Green, Traci Craig</creator><contributor>Hankins, Catherine (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Boivin, Jean Francois (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</subject><title>My place, your place, or a safer place : the intention among Montreal injecting drug users to use supervised injecting facilities</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h702q8201.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hf097</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9p290c436</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:59:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The solution structure of the C-terminal domain of the yeast Poly(A) Binding Protein (yPABC) was determined by NMR spectroscopy. The tridimensional fold is similar to that previously observed for the human isoform, except for a missing N-terminal alpha helix out of the five helices expected in total. A series of putative binding partners was identified in public databases, based on a consensual interaction motif that we formally defined as being S-X-L-[NS]-X-[ND]-A-X-E-F-X-P. However, no putative binding partner could be found that would match this pattern in S. Cerevisiae. Phylogenetic modeling tends to indicate that such an interacting domain might not be a fundamental part, if existing at all, of PABC function. A tridimensional model of each of the remaining twenty PABC orthologs was generated: the overall fold of five consecutive helices seen in human PABC is well conserved, in contradiction with recently published modeling studies based on the crystal structure of the homologous PABC domain from HYD, which predicts only four helices.</description><creator>Coillet-Matillon, Stéphane</creator><contributor>Gehring, Kalle (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><title>Structure modeling of the Poly (A) binding protein C-terminus family</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hq37vq414.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9p290c436</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:b5644t48p</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:59:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Heterozygous 1Neu mice transmit a single base pair insertion mutation within the paired domain (exon 2) of the PAX2 gene; this mutation is identical to that in humans with Renal-Coloboma Syndrome. In both mice and humans, PAX2 heterozygotes are born with optic colobomas and renal hypoplasia. Previously, we have shown that kidneys of fetal 1Neu mice have increased apoptosis of ureteric bud (UB) cells and reduced UB branching. However, it is unclear whether increased susceptibility to apoptosis is the critical determinant of renal hypoplasia in PAX2 haploinsufficiency. In this study, E13.5 fetal kidney pairs were microdissected from wildtype and heterozygous PAX2 mutant embryos and cultured +/- the caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk, for 50 hours. Explants were immunostained with Dolichos biflorus lectin, visualized by fluorescent microscopy and scored for the number of terminal UB branches. Mutant kidneys had fewer UB terminal branches compared to wildtype littermates (-20%, p = 0.04).
