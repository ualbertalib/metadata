Genetic assays that identify origin function in cloned DNA fragments would provide a useful approach for the isolation and analysis of mammalian DNA replication origins. In this thesis, (1) cloned fragments from a known mammalian origin, the ori$ beta$ of the hamster 3$ sp prime$ DHFR region, are demonstrated to replicate autonomously, both following transfection into human cells, and when used as templates in an in vitro replication system based on human cell extracts; (2) larger scale versions of these two assay methodologies are used to isolate over 40 novel putative origins of DNA replication from anticruciform purified human genomic DNA libraries; (3) transfection and in vitro autonomous replication assays are applied to demonstrate the potential origin function of a mitochondrial DNA sequence implicated in the insertional mutagenesis of a human genomic locus; (4) an origin mapping strategy based on the in vitro assay is used to provide evidence for the existence of a replication origin in a cloned and sequenced portion of the human 15q11q13 chromosomal subdomain, a region associated with allele-specific replication timing, genomic imprinting, and genetic disease; and (5) some of these autonomously replicating origins are cloned into a selectable YAC vector and are shown to permit the long term episomal maintenance, in human cells, of the transfected plasmid constructs. These results consistently demonstrate that short mammalian genomic DNA fragments can replicate autonomously, supporting the applicability of the replicon model in humans, and could be extended to the search for an origin core consensus element, to the investigation of higher order organization and temporal control of human DNA replication origins, and to the construction of a complete human artificial chromosome.</description><creator>Nielsen, Torsten</creator><contributor>Price, Gerald B.

An optical characterization of planar surface guides for a given set of fabrication conditions has been performed to determine the refractive index profile. Parallel to this, the ion-exchange diffusion process has been modelled numerically to predict the concentration profile of these waveguides. Direct measurements of the profiles using electron microprobe analysis has been carried out. The results of the characterization were used in the design and fabrication of a novel vertically integrated optical directional coupler. This device, composed of single-mode surface and buried ion-exchanged waveguides, allows for the optical fiber coupling to the buried guide and efficient power transfer to the surface guide, where the light can be detected by a modelled $GaAs$ photodetector. An improved version of the device using a sputtered $Al sb2O sb3$ surface guide allows for edge coupling to the detector. Calculations of the $GaAs$ absorption coefficient show an optimum behavior for a given thickness of $Al sb2O sb3$. An implicit finite-difference vector beam propagation method (FD-VBPM), that was improved to account for graded-index profiles, has been developed and used in the design of both directional-coupler structures. Finally, a three-dimensional FD-VBPM algorithm was implemented for the channel-guide version of the improved coupler.</description><creator>Noutsios, Peter C.</creator><contributor>Yip, Gar L.

The simulated system is divided into two components: the applied manure layer and the soil. The model describes the transformation processes occurring in both components separately. It is also capable of accounting for both micro and macroporous flows. In addition, the simulation can be done for time steps shorter than 1 day. The model was developed to be interactive and user-friendly and was constructed on a modular basis using Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation$ sp circler$ as a compiler. It can be run on an IBM$ sp circler$ or IBM compatible microcomputer with a minimum requirement of a 386 microprocessor with 4 MB RAM. This model was developed as a nitrogen management-oriented model. However, it can also be used to gain further understanding of nitrogen processes for research and teaching purposes. The accuracy of the stimulation was enhanced by taking into account moisture and temperature variation and distribution in the soil. The SWACROP and the HEAT programs were integrated into the MANIMEA model to generate transient moisture and temperature profiles, respectively. The Numerical Method Of Lines (NMOL) technique, which implements finite difference method, was used to numerically solve the partial differential equations in the model. Generally, the results generated by the MANIMEA model using the parameters from literature agreed with the results obtained by analytical solutions and from experiments. It was found that the model is highly sensitive to the volatilization and net mineralization rate constants $(K sb{v}$ and $K sb{m}).$ The study showed that the MANIMEA model can be implemented to evaluate nitrogen transformations, transport, and plant uptake for a wide range of climatic and soil conditions and organic type of wastes. Such a tool can contribute to the protection of our environment through a better management of organic nitrogen fertilizer and a better understanding of the nitrogen processes.</description><creator>Hengnirun, Somgiat.</creator><contributor>Barrineton, Suzelle (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Nitrogen in agriculture -- Management -- Computer simulation.</subject><subject>Nitrogen fertilizers -- Control.</subject><subject>Nitrogen fertilizers -- Environmental aspects.</subject><subject>Nitrogen cycle -- Computer simulation.</subject><title>A computer simulation model for manurial nitrogen management : environmental aspects (MANIMEA)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x059c911z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4m90dw99d</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9z903153x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:01:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The central cholinergic system is thought to be an integral component of the neural circuitry involved in mnemonic processes. The septohippocampal cholinergic pathway is considered crucial in this respect. In addition, however, other neurotransmitter systems are also likely involved in learning and memory either by interacting with the cholinergic system or on their own. Dopamine is postulated to be one such neurotransmitter. Accordingly, this thesis examines the possible interactions between dopamine and acetylcholine in the hippocampus, in particular in relation to cognitive processes. Using a fimbriaectomy/receptor autoradiography approach, we examined the location of hippocampal dopamine receptors and found that a proportion of dopamine D1-like receptors are likely located on cholinergic terminals in the hippocampus. Moreover, the stimulation of D1-like, but not D2-like, receptors enhanced in vivo hippocampal acetylcholine release, in a phasic manner. The loci for this action is apparently at the level of the cholinergic terminals within the hippocampus. There are at least two members of the D1-like family of dopamine receptors, namely D1 and D5 subtypes. Owing to the unavailability of selective ligands, we utilized a combined antisense-in vivo dialysis approach in order to ascertain which of these two receptors is involved in modulating hippocampal acetylcholine release. It appears that the D5 receptor subtype is responsible for this function. Interestingly, this is the first evidence of a possible function for the dopamine D5 receptor subtype in the mammalian brain. This dopaminergic modulation of hippocampal acetylcholine release is preserved as the animal ages. Interestingly, stimulation of D1-like receptors attenuated the memory deficits observed in aged rats in the Morris water maze task. Thus the hippocampal dopamine-acetylcholine interactions likely have a cognitive significance. Finally, dopamine D1-like receptors were also found in the hippocampal formation of monkey and human brains. It is conceivable, therefore, that dopamine acting via these receptors might serve similar functions in primates as those described above for the rat. Taken together, the results presented in this thesis provide information about the heteroregulation of the cholinergic synapses in the hippocampus. Most importantly, this work suggests a novel approach to alleviate age-associated memory deficits by stimulating D5 receptors.</description><creator>Hersi, Ali I.</creator><contributor>Quirion, Remi (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Dopaminergic modulation of the septohippocampal cholinergic system</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2f75r938z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z903153x</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:f7623f265</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:01:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A new system has been developed for in-flight capture of continuous high energy mass separated radioactive ion beams of the ISOLDE type. To test the system, a precision high voltage ion gun based on surface ionization of cesium has also been developed. This gun delivers stable currents to 300 nA at energies to 65 keV with emittances at 50 keV of 1.3 $ pi$-mm-mrad. The ion collection system is a high-field dc decelerator leading into a very large Paul trap at an elevated potential and employing buffer gas ion cooling. The ring electrode is of internal diameter 120 mm, the end electrodes are separated by 106 mm, and rf amplitudes of up to 10 kV can be applied on the ring. Tests showed that 50% of a 60 keV beam can be injected through the 8 mm hole into a trap at energies of a few tens of eV. Trap performance was analyzed from time-of-flight observations of extracted beam pulses. Extraction included a pulse-down cavity capable of lowering the potential of the extracted ion cloud from 60 kV to zero. Beam pulses of less than 1 $ mu s$ were delivered at energies less than 5 keV to a detector 2 m from the trap with an overall efficiency of about 0.4% of the beam from the ion gun. A thermodynamic model of the ions in the trap, with ion temperatures of 500 K for about $10 sp4$ ions and of 1000 K for about $10 sp7$ ions, almost fully accounts for the experimental results, the minor discrepancies between the modeled shape and the observed shape of the detector pulses being attributed to space charge effects in the collected ion clouds. The use of this model to simulate the extracted ion pulses showed the pulses to have a longitudinal emittance of about 5 $ pi$-eV-$ mu s$ and normalized transverse emittances of about 1 $ pi$-eV$ mu s.$ The model also indicates that the extraction system pulled only about 16% of the collected ions out of the trap. Methods are suggested for improving this extraction efficiency and further studies are suggested for improving the incoming ion collection efficiency.</description><creator>Ghalambor Dezfuli, Abdol Mohammad.</creator><contributor>Moore, Robert (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Physics, Molecular.</subject><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Injection, cooling, and extraction of ions from a very large Paul trap</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gb19f751p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f7623f265</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9k41zg12j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:01:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The insulin mimetic bisperoxovanadium (bpV) complexes $ rm K sb2 lbrack VO(O sb2) sb2(OHpic) rbrack (OHpic = 3$-hydroxypicolinato) and $ rm K sb3 lbrack VO(O sb2) sb2(L$-$ rm L sp prime ) rbrack $ have been prepared and characterized, where L-$ rm L sp prime$ is a pyridinedicarboxylate (2,3-pdc, 2,4-pdc, and 2,5-pdc) or 3-acetatoxypicolinato (acetpic). The single crystal X-ray structures of three of the compounds have been determined: bpV(OHpic), bpV(2,4-pdc) and bpV(acetpic). These complexes, with the addition of one other previously reported unsubstituted bpV(pic) complex, comprise two series of insulin mimetic bpV complexes varying in the structure of their ancillary ligands. Structure activity relationships are reported for these compounds. The stability of peroxovanadium (pV) compounds in HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid), MOPS (4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid), and phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 is determined as well as their stability at pH 4, 5, 6 and 7. The use of HEPES with pV complexes is not recommended, but phosphate and MOPS buffer provide alternative buffers at physiological pH. The reactivity of pV compounds with EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), DTT (dithiothreitol), bovine liver catalase and potassium ferrocyanide is discussed. The oxidation of tris(3-sulfonatophenyl)phosphine to the corresponding oxide, the oxidation of cysteine to the disulfide cystine and to cysteinesulfinic acid by bpV compounds are described. The oxidations are models of the mechanism of inhibition of the enzyme protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) by pV complexes. The mechanism for the insulin mimetic activity of pV compounds in vivo is discussed.</description><creator>Hall, David A., 1968-</creator><contributor>Shaver, Alan (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Chemistry, Inorganic.</subject><subject>Chemistry, Organic.</subject><subject>Chemistry, Pharmaceutical.</subject><title>Insulin-mimetic peroxovanadium compounds : synthesis, reactivity,and mechanism of action</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8k71nj74p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9k41zg12j</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:m039k675d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:01:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In the N$ sb2$ fixing legume symbiosis, suboptimal root zone temperatures (RZTs) not only decrease N$ sb2$ fixation. but reduce the formation and development of nodules. The purpose of this thesis was to elucidate the mechanism by which suboptimal RZTs affect nodulation and nodule development in legumes, such as soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) and to attempt to find ways to overcome this inhibition. Initial studies characterized the RZT response in soybean plants inoculated with Bradyrhizobium japonicum. In plants grown at RZTs from 25 to 17$ sp circ$C, the time between soybean inoculation with B. japonicum and the beginning of N$ sb2$ fixation increased by 2.5 days for every $ sp circ$C decrease, whereas below 17$ sp circ$C RZT each $ sp circ$C appeared to delay the onset of N$ sb2$ fixation by 7 days. RZTs less than 17$ sp circ$C strongly inhibited the nodulation process and, as a result also sharply decreased N$ sb2$ fixation per plant. The greater sensitivity below 17$ sp circ$C is due to events related to, or occurring before infection initiation. Coinoculation of soybean with B. japonicum and other microorganisms beneficial to legumes, either vesicular-arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizae or plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), increased soybean nodulation and N$ sb2$ fixation, but these increases were temperature dependent. Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization had a negative effect on nodule establishment below 18.5$ sp circ$C RZT, but a positive one above this RZT. At each temperature tested some PGPR increased the amount of fixed N and number of nodules formed, whereas some decreased the level of these variables. The most stimulatory strain at each temperature was: 15$ sp circ$C-Serratia proteamaculans 1-102, 17.5$ sp circ$C - S. proteamaculans 1-102 and Aeromonas hydrophila P73, and 25$ sp circ$C - S. liquefaciens 2-68. Because our research indicated that an event before infection thread initiation was most sensitive, and because the first known step in establishment of the symbiosis is production of a plant-to-bacterial signal molecules. I tested whether the poor nodulation at suboptimal RZTs was related to disruption of plant-to-bacterium signalling. Inocula bacteria were preincubated with genistein, a major isoflavonoid signal molecule in soybean. This shortened the period between inoculation and root hair curling, and hastened the onset of N$ sb2$ fixation under both controlled environment and field conditions. At 15 and 17.5$ sp circ$C RZTs, 20 and 15 $ mu$M genistein was found to reduce the inhibition of suboptimal RZTs, increase nodulation, and accelerate the onset of ${ rm N} sb2$ fixation. When applied to the plant rhizosphere in the field, genistein also reduced the inhibitory effects of cold spring soils on nodulation and N$ sb2$ fixation. Direct measurements of genistein accumulation in soybean roots indicated that, with decreasing RZTs, genistein accumulation decreased. B. japonicum USDA110 containing plasmid ZB977 with nodY-lacZ fusion genes incubated with genistein under different temperatures indicated that higher genistein concentrations and longer incubation times were required to activate the lacZ gene to a maximum level under low incubation temperature. Overall, these findings suggested that plant-to-bacteria signal molecules such as genistein may be an important limiting factor in the nodulation of legume plants at low RZT.</description><creator>Zhang, Feng, 1962 Aug. 29-</creator><date>1996</date><subject>Nitrogen -- Fixation.</subject><subject>Soybean -- Roots.</subject><subject>Soybean -- Effect of cold on.</subject><subject>Roots (Botany) -- Temperature.</subject><title>Soybean symbiotic signal exchange, nodulation, and nitrogen fixation under suboptimal root zone temperatures</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hq37vq16s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m039k675d</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Plant Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p2676x33k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:01:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A Paul trap has been constructed for laser spectroscopic studies of the isotope shifts (IS) and hyperfine structures (hfs) of radioactive isotopes. With a sample placed near the inner surface of the ring electrode, the target atoms are evaporated by a Nd:YAG laser pulse, and then selectively ionized inside the trap by a synchronized dye laser pulse through resonance ionization spectroscopy (RIS). A cw beam from a ring dye laser is used to probe the ions, and laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) is monitored for spectroscopic measurements. The stored ions can also be analyzed by the ion-ejection time-of-flight spectrum. With an ultra-high vacuum base pressure, Hf ion storage times of one hour can be readily achieved by introducing H$ sb2$ as a buffer gas. It is demonstrated that with a very dilute sample, Hf ions can be accumulated in the trap through successive heating and RIS pulses. Through LIF measurements, both the ion cooling time and the dependence of the mean ion kinetic energy on the RF phase and trap operating conditions have been studied. A phase-locked counting technique has been applied to improve the spectroscopic resolution. The hfs of $ sp{177}$Hf and $ sp{179}$Hf with the transition a $ rm sp2D sb{3/2}$--$z sp4{ rm F} sbsp{5/2}{ circ} ( lambda$ = 340 nm) in HfII has been studied with a resolution of about 1 GHz, and their hfs A and B constants have been deduced. The IS of the radioactive $ sp{172}$Hf has been carried out with a sample containing $7 times10 sp{11} sp{172}$Hf atoms. Based on the observation of the laser-induced formation of HfH, a new spectroscopic method capable of selectively suppressing the ion population of a particular contaminant isotope has been developed to enhance the $ sp{172}$Hf signal-to-noise ratio. Deduced changes of mean-square nuclear charge radii in Hf, together with the existing data in the literature, are discussed and compared with theoretical variations obtained from Finite-Range Droplet Model calculations.</description><creator>Zhao, Wenzheng</creator><contributor>Lee, Jonathan K.

First, using the tangential differential calculus and the oriented boundary distance function, we derive two intrinsic nonlinear models for thin/shallow shells made up of a Saint Venant-Kirchhoff material or a homogeneous, isotropic, elastic material. The models extend the natural theory of plates to thin/shallow shells. Next, we prove the regularity property for the solutions of the linear model, and differentiability of the nonlinear operators associated with the nonlinear models in the given spaces. Finally, we prove existence and uniqueness theorems for the solution of the two nonlinear models using the inverse function theorem. Moreover, we discuss the Love-Kirchhoff theory and the Naghdi's and Koiter's conditions for nonlinear shells.</description><creator>Zhao, Jiabin</creator><contributor>Delfour, Michel (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Mathematics.</subject><title>Natural theory of nonlinear shells</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6682x5550.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6t053h650</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3r074w31n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:02:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The thesis examines the emergence of a new idea--trade union investment funds. The thesis looks at their establishment in Sweden, Italy and Quebec in the years 1983-84. The thesis aims to compare these three funds, the first three in the developed countries, and attempts to explain the reason for the important differences between the funds. The thesis situates the funds within the overall concept of economic democracy and traces a brief historical sketch of the development of this idea. The evolution of the general fund idea is exposed as is the debate over the significance of the funds in intellectual, political and union circles. The thesis examines whether the funds, particularly the Swedish version, represent a step forward towards socialism, yet a further integration of the working class into advanced capitalist society or an attack on democratic pluralism.</description><creator>Anderson, John (John Stark)</creator><date>1986</date><subject>Syndicates (Finance) -- Québec (Province)</subject><subject>Labor unions -- Québec (Province) -- Accounting.</subject><subject>Syndicates (Finance) -- Italy.</subject><subject>Labor unions -- Italy -- Accounting.</subject><subject>Labor unions -- Sweden -- Accounting.</subject><subject>Syndicates (Finance) -- Sweden.</subject><title>Trade union investment funds : the emergence of a new idea and its realization in Sweden, Italy and Québec</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4x51hk31r.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3r074w31n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:t722hb020</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:02:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is an examination and assessment of the life and work of Evelyn Underhill. Particular emphasis is given to the development of her thought after she had written the classic, Mysticism: a Study in the Nature of Development of Man's Spiritual Consciousness. After more than a decade of being virtually a non-communicating Roman Catholic, Underhill returned to the church of her baptism and confirmation, the Church of England. The "shift" in her thought which led to this decision and subsequent commitment resulted in what she herself called her "vocation." This was followed by an involvement in the retreat movement and in an increase in the task of that classic art, called in the church, the "cure of souls." To her writings on philosophy and religion she added collections of retreat addresses. Together with the correspondence between Underhill and Friedrich von Hugel, many of her works offer an important contribution to spirituality today--its history, theory and practice.</description><creator>Dalgaard, Anne Elisabeth.</creator><date>1984</date><subject>Mysticism</subject><subject>Underhill, Evelyn, 1875-1941.</subject><subject>Spirituality</subject><title>Evelyn Underhill after Mysticism : an assessment of her later years</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m900nv779.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t722hb020</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Religious Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0p096820s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:02:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The design of traditional and novel structures, e.g. underground tunnels, dam foundations, nuclear waste depositories, requires an understanding of the behaviour of rock under different stress conditions. This thesis is part of an overall research program into the behaviour of rock masses undertaken by the Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering at McGill University. The main objective of this project is the determination of the appropriate stress functions that describe the response of rock to applied loads. In this work, the distinction is made between intact, single discontinuity and fractured rock material. The first segment of this thesis deals with a critical evaluation of the different failure criteria for rock and rock discontinuities that have been used in the past. Their applications and limitations are identified. In the second segment of this work, the frictional behaviour of rock and rock discontinuities is defined, based on results of laboratory testing in direct-shear and triaxial compression.</description><creator>Hadjigeorgiou, John</creator><date>1987</date><subject>Geophysics.</subject><subject>Engineering, Mining.</subject><subject>Geotechnology.</subject><title>A study of frictional properties of rock masses /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p8418p41j.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0p096820s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gh93h071d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:02:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Beam Propagation Method (BPM) together with an accurate Effective Index model is used as a Computer Aided Design (CAD) tool for the analysis, design and optimization of integrated optical devices.

It was found that increasing the substrate temperature during the selenium deposition between 80 and 140$ sp circ$C increased the illuminated short circuit current density in the cell. This clearly demonstrated the necessity of having well-crystallized selenium, as opposed to amorphous selenium, as the active absorber layer in this cell. The CdO layer was normally deposited by d.c. reactive sputtering from a cadmium target in an ambient of argon plus residual air and, as a result of optimizing experiments, conversion efficiency of about 2% was obtained under an illumination of 100 mWcm$ sp{-2}$. The CdO layer was also deposited by r.f. magnetron sputtering from a CdO target. This produced satisfactory cells but with lower shunt resistance values than in the d.c. sputtered devices. It was found that the electrical resistivity of the CdO layer was decreased with increase of r.f. power and with decrease of sputtering pressure. Exploratory Se-CdO cells were also fabricated on glass substrates using d.c. reactive sputtering. By connecting these electrically in series, a photovoltaic panel was constructed and incorporated as the power source in a small pocket calculator, which was found to function satisfactorily under indoor lighting. An inverted structure of the form CdO-Se-metal was also fabricated and shown to function as a photovoltaic device.</description><creator>Shukri, Ziad A.

Large numbers of infective propagules were produced in shake-flask liquid fermentation with modified Richard's (V-8) medium and in solid-substrate fermentation with pearl barley grains. In complex liquid media, pycnidium-like structures were observed. Most conidia stored at $-$70$ sp circ$C remained viable and virulent for at least six months. In controlled environment studies, a minimum of 18 hr of dew was required for severe disease development on inoculated plants. The addition of gelatin, Sorbo $ sp{ rm TM}$, or BOND$ sp{ rm TM}$ to the inoculum did not enhance the disease under various leaf wetness periods. A continuous dew period of 18 hr was superior to the cumulative effect of three interrupted 6 hr dew periods. Secondary inoculum was produced on diseased plants placed under moist conditions for 48 hr or more. In greenhouse experiments, seedlings at the cotyledon and 3- to 5- leaf stage were severely diseased and killed when inoculated with 10$ sp9$ conidia/m$ sp2$. This inoculum density adversely affected the regenerative ability of 4 wk old seedlings and established plants, but few plants were killed. Inoculation of the healthy regrowth from plants previously inoculated with the fungus resulted in much less disease symptoms than expected.</description><creator>Morin, Louise</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Phytopathogenic fungi.</subject><subject>Weeds -- Biological control.</subject><subject>Bindweed -- Biological control.</subject><title>Development of the field bindweed bioherbicide, Phomopsis convolvulus : spore production and disease development</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xd07gt85d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dn39x253c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Plant Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:j3860812v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:02:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study evaluated the ability of subjects at 3 levels of expertise, expert physicians, residents and medical students, in the acquisition, representation, and utilization of patient information in the context of solving a complex medical problem. Each subject interviewed a volunteer medical outpatient and was subsequently requested to provide a differential diagnosis. The doctor-patient dialogue was analyzed using cognitive methods of discourse analysis. These methods were used to characterize differences in the content and nature of the history-taking process and in the development of problem representations. The study characterized differences at two levels of representation, observations and findings. Observations are the minimal semantic units of the doctor patient discourse. Findings are higher order units that derive meaning in specific medical contexts. Differences were found between groups of subjects in the accuracy of diagnoses and in the qualitative nature of representations. These differences were manifested most clearly in terms of a series of efficiency measures designed to characterize the ability of subjects to generate findings. In general, the expert physicians were more selective in the elicitation and processing of critical and relevant findings. An attempt is made to characterize these differences in terms of the strategies used to acquire and represent patient information.</description><creator>Kaufman, David R.</creator><date>1987</date><subject>Medical history taking</subject><subject>Medical personnel and patient</subject><subject>Communication in medicine</subject><subject>Interviewing</subject><title>Representation and utilization of information during the clinical interview in medicine</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j9602200j.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j3860812v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vd66w104x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:02:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In Canada, the depression of the 1930's forced existing private and public charities to adjust to the overwhelming financial pressures of the decade. Canada's largest urban centre, Montreal, was markedly different from every other major Canadian city because of the municipality's failure to accept any degree of responsibility for the poor and unemployed prior to 1930. Montreal was dominated by a complex private charity network that was divided by religion and language. This thesis examines how one large private charity organization, the Montreal Council of Social Agencies reacted and adjusted to the depression of the 1930's. Because the Montreal Council of Social Agencies was English and Protestant, it borrowed its methods and ideas from England, the United States and other provinces rather than from the largely French Catholic province of Quebec. During the depression, conceptions of charity were radically altered. The Montreal Council of Social Agencies tried to compel municipal, provincial and federal governments to play larger roles in welfare work and supported the professionalization of social work. Most significant, the Montreal Council of Social Agencies was guided through the 1930's by its own charity philosophy which was retained and reinforced rather than weakened by this crisis.</description><creator>MacLennan, Anne</creator><date>1984</date><subject>Depressions -- 1929 -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</subject><subject>Charities -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- History</subject><subject>Montreal Council of Social Agencies</subject><title>Charity and change : the Montreal Council of Social Agencies' attempts to deal with the depression</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9593tw35m.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vd66w104x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3x816n68j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:02:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Short-term memory (STM) consists of two major components. The first is an active articulatory loop, responsible for the internal articulation of verbal items that permits the recycling and continuous refreshing of information. The second involves a passive phonological store into which auditory speech information enters directly. The first part of this thesis consists of a general evaluation of the cognitive impairments in three brain-damaged patients, who show a similar reduction in their auditory span, related to the components of STM. The word length effect, the phonological similarity effect and the primacy and recency effects are examined under normal conditions and under articulatory suppression. The second part of this work is based on a mathematical model from which derived three variables: "a" and "b" representing the internal rehearsal mechanism, and "T" which is the temporal capacity limiting the operation of auditory short-term memory. A double dissociation was found between the articulatory mechanism and the temporal capacity, and a further one between two different processes within the articulatory mechanism. "a" reflecting the activation and recovery of an entire chunk, and "b" the articulation of syllables.</description><creator>Durand, Guylaine M.

The attraction of feminists to the dramas of a playwright who avowedly wrote from this patriarchal standpoint is elucidated by a consideration of the appropriation of the woman-centered texts of patriarchal "feminism" by recent feminists seeking material to reinforce their own movement. The apparently paradoxical project of the analysis of three Ibsen characters, Nora Helmer, Rebekka West and Hedda Gabler, in terms of contemporary feminist literary theory suggests a parallel means of appropriation. These potentially redefined female characters are afforded an added dimension of reality by their embodiment by actresses in stage performances that allows theatre history to be related to real-life history, in which, contemporaneously, nineteenth-century women were beginning to take part.</description><creator>Farfan, Penelope</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Ibsen, Henrik, 1828-1906 -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><subject>Ibsen, Henrik, 1828-1906 -- Characters -- Women</subject><subject>Women in literature</subject><title>Ibsen's female characters and the feminist problematic</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tm70mw432.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tb09j678n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qr46r2230</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:02:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis, a constant and grounded capacitor model for MOS transistor is proposed for circuit simulation and timing simulation. The model, based on the well known one by Hodges and Jackson, accounts for most of the physical and processing parameters that influence the transient times. This model takes the advantage of the fully complementary MOS technology which is widely used in today's industry for VLSI circuits. In the model, all the energy storage effects of a MOSFET are first represented by equivalent constant terminal capacitances including constant floating ones. Furthermore, each of these floating capacitances is replaced by two constant grounded ones, replacing the two terminals of the original floating one. The model with floating capacitors is much more accurate but is better suited for circuit simulation than for timing simulation. The largest error in the model with constant grounded capacitances results from the feed-forward effect. The methods to overcome this effect, and the conditions under which it is significant, are discussed. The experiments show that this new constant grounded capacitance model can get much more accurate results than the one by Hodges and Jackson. Agreement with the HSPICE circuit simulator is within 10% in most of the cases.</description><creator>Zhang, Weimin, 1958-</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>MOS transistor modeling for timing analysis and simulation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kw52j926x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qr46r2230</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pk02cb99r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:02:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The kinematics of wiping movements to the back were examined in spinal adult Rana Catesbeiana. The aim was to identify the elements of the back wipe and their functional role. The data show that there are three essential phases of the wiping movement: a placing phase; a flexion of the hip and knee; and a whisk/extension phase. The first phase is the only one which is dependent upon stimulus location. The spinal frog adjusts the hindlimb to account for stimulus location in the rostro-caudal direction. There is no adjustment for stimulus position along the medial-lateral axis of the body. It is proposed that the second phase serves as a preparatory movement for the extension portion of the wipe. When the wipe is partitioned into these phases, the motion was found to be planar for the first and third phases. At the end of the first phase there was a transition between the two planes.</description><creator>Sergio, Lauren E.

The limb movements must be measured over a range of 10 mm, with a resolution of 1 nm SD (standard deviation), in experiments lasting less than 1 second. The maximum displacement speed of the limbs is 2 m/s. To fulfil the design requirements, the approach taken here is to consider that the full measurement resolution is only needed when the limb is approaching its target at low speed. The interferometer described in this thesis is capable of high accuracy fringe interpolation measurements over a range of 10 mm, with a resolution of 0.1 nm SD, in a bandwidth of 100 kHz, in a 1 second time period. For low resolution measurements when the limb is moving at high speed, the interferometer measures displacements by fringe counting. Experimental results are presented which demonstrate that the accuracy of the interferometer actually exceeds the high resolution design objective by an order of magnitude. Also, results of experiments which study the effect of noise sources (both inherent to the interferometer and from the environment) on the accuracy of the measurements are presented. Finally, results of an experiment where the interferometer was used in a practical application to demonstrate its usefulness are presented: the interferometer was used in the closed-loop control of a non-linear micro-actuator.</description><creator>Charette, Paul Gilles</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>An integrated fringe counting and interpolation laser heterodyne interferometer for micro-robot position measurement /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nk322f40d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zk51vh847</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biomedical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qj72p8351</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:02:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis investigates the geomorphology of retrogressive thaw slumps and active layer slides on Herschel Island, northern Yukon Territory. In particular, it examines the formation and morphology of both landforms, and the ground ice characteristics of retrogressive thaw slumps. During 1988-1989 a number of retrogressive thaw slumps and active layer slides were surveyed and monitored. Field and laboratory investigations involved (1) documentation of landform distribution, setting and morphology, (2) examination of processes of landform formation, and (3) the examination of cryostratigraphy, ground ice characteristics and material properties. Retrogressive thaw slumps developed in areas of low to moderate slopes underlain by a variety of sediments with ice contents up to 4500% (on a dry weight basis). Slump headwall retreat rates of up to 19.5 m/yr were recorded. By comparison, active layer slides developed on steeper slopes underlain mainly by marine silts and clays. The sediments exposed in the slide floors and headwalls displayed no visible ground ice, but moisture contents were between 15-35%. Retrogressive thaw slumps and active layer slides form by entirely different processes. However, they do occur in close association and are influenced by many of the same parameters.</description><creator>De krom, Valentina</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Earthflows -- Yukon -- Herschel Island.</subject><subject>Geomorphology -- Yukon -- Herschel Island.</subject><subject>Landforms -- Yukon -- Herschel Island.</subject><subject>Thermokarst.</subject><title>A geomorphic investigation of retrogressive thaw slumps and active layer slides on Herschel Island, Yukon Territory /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vx021g444.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qj72p8351</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4b29b739n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:02:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Rational and efficient numerical modelling procedures are required to simulate the dynamic behaviour of dam-foundation-reservoir systems. Significant nonlinear response mechanism such as uplifting of the dam under severe ground motion should be considered to obtain a realistic evaluation of seismic stability and structural behaviour. In this study, the performance of three different time-domain reservoir modelling procedures suitable for nonlinear analysis were investigated. These were an added mass approach based on the Westergaard method, and finite element formulations using either fluid pressures or displacements to represent the reservoir. The efficiency of various coordinate reduction procedures were studied to progressively reduce the number of degrees-of-freedom needed to properly represent the earthquake response of uplifting gravity dams. Parametric analyses of a typical two-dimensional model were carried out to determine the influence of key modelling assumptions on the structural response. The parameters considered were the intensity of uplift pressures and the mesh density at the dam-foundation interface, the relative stiffness of the dam and the foundation, and the height of the dam.</description><creator>Sauvé, Ghislain</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Engineering, Civil.</subject><title>Seismic analysis of uplifting concrete gravity dams</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wm117q105.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4b29b739n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):27975</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
