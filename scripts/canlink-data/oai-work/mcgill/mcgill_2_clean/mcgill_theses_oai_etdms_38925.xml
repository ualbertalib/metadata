The significance of compliance is highlighted in certain spheres of international law that deal with specific extraordinary circumstances. This is particularly true with respect to international humanitarian law, which is applicable during periods of armed conflict. The importance of ensuring and improving compliance with international humanitarian law is clearly expressed in the opening Article of the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their Additional Protocol I of 1977, in which the High Contracting Parties undertake to both "respect" and "ensure respect" for these instruments. This thesis is derived from a conviction that compliance with international humanitarian norms is more efficiently ensured through implementation, rather than enforcement mechanisms. However, it only ventures a critique of the appropriateness of military intervention as one of the mechanisms most frequently used to enforce humanitarian rules in the past decade of armed conflicts. The hypothesis this thesis postulates is that the recourse to armed force to ensure respect for international humanitarian law is at cross-purposes with the body of these rules. This statement is assessed against the Security Council's military humanitarian intervention in civil conflicts. It is suggested that the validity of the Council's decisions on humanitarian intervention hinges upon two equally determinative criteria: legality and legitimacy. The hypothesis of the thesis questions both the legality and legitimacy of the Security Council's authorized military humanitarian intervention in armed conflicts. The underlying purpose of the thesis is thus to expand the parameters of theoretical discussions about compliance in the context of international humanitarian law from a jurisprudential perspective.</description><creator>Saberi, Hengameh</creator><contributor>Leuprecht, Peter (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Humanitarian intervention.</subject><subject>Intervention (International law)</subject><subject>Human rights</subject><title>Legality and legitimacy of the use of force to ensure respect for international humanitarian law</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8p58pf84f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vh53wx724</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:td96k454g</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>To support and keep pace with the Internet growth, new routers based on optical multi-stage architectures are emerging. These routers consist of multiple shelves interconnected with parallel optical interconnects. This thesis proposes the analysis of the inter-channel crosstalk of a state-of-the-art 1 x 12 VCSEL and PIN array based parallel optical interconnect operating at 2.5 Gb/s. The crosstalk properties of the parallel optical interconnect will impact the optical power link budget and scalability of these multi-stage routers. To study the crosstalk properties of the optical interconnect, a special test set-up and detailed test procedures were created to analyse the bit error rate and jitter performance of the parallel optical interconnect in multi-channel operation. The results obtained from the pre-defined experiments confirmed the degradation of the interconnect performance due to inter-channel crosstalk. This performance penalty also limits system scalability, especially when it is combined with the inherent crosstalk properties of the optical redirection boxes. The sources of inter-channel crosstalk were also determined. Finally the system optical link budgets were adjusted and rough system scalability limits were obtained.</description><creator>Arsenault, Patrick</creator><contributor>Chen, Lawrence (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Cross-talk analysis of a 12 channel 2.5 GBs VCSEL array based parallel optical interconnect for a multi-stage scalable router architecture</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8p58pf85q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/td96k454g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:12579v168</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This work focused on the natural development of neurotachykinin-1 (NK-1) receptors in the porcine brainstem during postnatal development (using 4 ages vs adult), and on alterations in these receptors after single and six-daily repeated clustered hypoxia (using young and older piglets). NK-1 receptor localization and densities were determined by quantitative autoradiography, using mono-iodinated Bolton-Hunter substance P ([125I]-BHSP). Slide-mounted brainstem sections, incubated in [125I]-BHSP and then exposed to film, have shown [125I]-BHSP binding throughout many brainstem nuclei and tracts, including the ambigual/periambigual (nAmb), dorsal motor vagal (dmnv), hypoglossal (nHyp), lateral reticular (nRL), gigantocellular (nGC), solitary tract (nTS), medial parabrachial (nPBM), and raphe obscurus (nROb) nuclei. NK-1 receptor densities decreased with age. As compared to normoxia, NK-1 receptor densities increased significantly after the 6-daily hypoxia protocol in dmnv, nHyp, nRL, nROb, and nTS of both young and older age groups. This increase may represent receptor upregulation as an adaptation to repeated hypoxia.</description><creator>Rodier, Mitchell Ellis</creator><contributor>Moss, Immanula (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><title>Effects of age and clustered hypoxia on neurotachykinin-1 receptors in brainstem of developing swine</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5x21th35q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/12579v168</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physiology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h128ng58g</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Head motion during fMRI experiments continues to be a significant problem for analysis, producing artifacts that can severely degrade image quality and make interpretation difficult and inaccurate. Such movement artifacts can lead to reduced statistical significance when detecting true activation or may lead to the creation of spurious activations. To address the problem of interscan motion, a retrospective image registration method has been developed. The registration technique is based on the use of non-linear deformation fields, the least-trimmed-squares robust estimator and Procrustes analysis. The registration algorithm was validated using simulated anatomical MRI volumes and real fMRI datasets. The registration technique is robust in the presence of large amounts of noise; and the experiments show that the method gives accurate estimations of motion up to 5 mm translation in all three directions and 5 degrees rotation around the three axes. The correction procedure also yields increased statistical power in activated regions, and thereby facilitates the precise localization of true activated areas.</description><creator>Reinertsen, Ingerid R.</creator><contributor>Collins, D.

Using an anti-oppressive framework, this thesis examines whether the oppression of street youth is ever inadvertently contributed to, reproduced, or perpetuated by services that youth access voluntarily. In addition, this research also explores what possible reasons or conditions might be promoting or perpetuating the oppression of street youth through helping agencies or by helping professionals. Lastly, youth were asked what anti-oppressive practices they could identify in current services, as well as how they would begin to define anti-oppressive practice with street youth.

However, diversity is limited in social work programs as these programs focus primarily on the teaching of verbal methods of connection for social workers to engage with clients. Non verbal methods of communication are limited in social work programs. This inhibits diversity as research has demonstrated that many clients for various reasons are unable to communicate through verbal dialogue. This present study explored social workers attitudes towards the use of art in their therapy. Six social workers from a children's mental health agency were interviewed and the results indicated that social workers used art in their work and found it beneficial for their clients. The social workers limited education in non-verbal modalities of communication however, prevented them from using the art effectively. The study recommends that social work programs include nonverbal methods of communication to ensure diversity and best practice for the profession of social work.</description><creator>Rees, Sharon M.</creator><contributor>Wright, Robin (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Social workers -- Ontario -- attitudes</subject><subject>Social work with children -- Ontario</subject><subject>Art therapy for children -- Ontario</subject><title>An exploration of clinical social workers' attitudes towards the use of art in their therapy /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b2773x60q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kh04dr47p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:m039k700j</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This paper investigates whether or not the experience of survivors of the Holocaust through the dying process follow the stages and tasks of dying as defined in the theoretical literature and the ramifications this has for the social worker serving these individuals and their families. The methodology employed was a library search to overlay the literature on death and dying upon the literature concerning Holocaust survivors. The study concludes that, for the most part, there is little congruence between the theories of dying and the coping mechanisms of the Holocaust survivor and that a different model of death and dying is required for this population. In order to provide a preliminary model and guide workers who might encounter terminally ill survivors and their families as patients and clients, approaches for engagement, assessment, and intervention are proposed and analyzed.</description><creator>Friedman, Mark David</creator><contributor>Hopmeyer, Estelle (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Social work with the terminally ill.</subject><subject>Death -- Psychological aspects.</subject><subject>Holocaust survivors -- Psychology.</subject><title>The holocaust survivor's experience of death and dying : a model for social work assessment and intervention</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1544br35q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m039k700j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:t722hb658</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis contains a summary of previous cold-formed steel stud shear wall test programs in North America, as well as an overview of the seismic requirements for a number of different design standards, i.e. the NBCC, the UBC and the NEHRP guidelines for seismic design.

For determining the in situ hydraulic conductivity characteristics of porous media, one of the most convenient and popular methods is the cased borehole technique. In this method, water is allowed to enter the excavated region of the cased borehole inserted into the ground. The rate of rise of water in the casing is then used to estimate the hydraulic conductivity characteristics of the porous medium in the vicinity of the entry point. When the porous medium has isotropic hydraulic conductivity characteristics, the "intake shape factor", which influences the flow rate is solely dependent on the geometrical arrangement of the intake region. When the intake region is located in a porous medium with transversely isotropic hydraulic conductivity characteristics, the flow rate is influenced by both the geometrical characteristics of the intake region and the mismatch in the directional hydraulic conductivity. The objective of the thesis is to investigate certain aspects of water flow in porous geomaterials that display hydraulic anisotropy. The thesis also characterizes the flow rate for entry points that are located in soils with transversely isotropic hydraulic conductivity. This study presents the application of computational procedures, based on finite element techniques, for the determination of the intake characteristics of a cylindrical intake located in a hydraulically transversely isotropic porous medium. Numerical results presented, illustrate the situations where the separate hydraulic conductivities can be estimated by a suitable alteration in the geometrical characteristics of the cylindrical intake. An approximate relationship is developed for estimation of the intake shape factor of cylindrical entry regions without a repeat of detailed finite element computations.</description><creator>Foroutan, Rana</creator><contributor>Selvadurai, A.

The case where the sources are immobile persons speaking in a reverberant room is of particular interest, because it represents a first step toward unlocking the so-called "cocktail party problem". Due to the reverberations, BSS in the time domain is usually expensive in terms of computations, but the number of computations can be significantly decreased if separation is carried out in subbands. An implementation of a subband-based BSS system using DFT filter banks is described, and an adaptive algorithm tailored for subband separation is developed. Aliasing present in the filter bank (due to the non-ideal frequency response of the filters) is reduced by using an oversampled scheme. Experiments, conducted with two-input two-output BSS systems, using both subband and fullband adaptation, indicate that separation and distortion rates are similar for both systems. However, the proposed 32-subband system is approximately 10 times computationally faster than the fullband system.</description><creator>Duplessis-Beaulieu, François</creator><contributor>Champagne, Benoit (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Fast convolutive blind speech separation via subband adaptation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gx41mk820.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0v8382410</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:t148fj98b</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>InGaAs/InP PIN photodetectors have been fabricated in the laboratory. Several material characterization techniques are performed to characterize the material. They include current-voltage (I-V) measurements, capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements, electron beam induce current (EBIC) measurements and deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) measurements. It is found that sample V1 and V1B have a higher n- region doping concentration then that of sample V2A. The measurements also indicate that the recombination currents in the devices are small. Depletion width of one of the photodetector in sample V1B is measured and has a value of 0.798 um under zero bias. Using EBIC measurement technique, the maximum electric field within the device is determined and has a value of 12.53 kV/cm under zero bias. It is found that there are minimum measurable majority deep states in the n - intrinsic region of the photodetectors using DLTS measurement technique while deep states are found in the InP buffer layer.

The HANP, Highly Adaptive Network Processor, architecture is implemented on FPGA and supports line speeds reaching OC-192. HANP is designed as a platform for the analysis and development of Network Processors. It is intended to serve as a flexible and customizable framework to enable future research on tradeoffs involved in building a Network Processor, including feasibility of FPGA implementation. This thesis outlines the architectural design of the HANP and addresses architectural issues including cache organization, processor optimizations, function distribution and system performance optimizations. Particular attention is given to motivating design choices. FPGA design and implementation issues are also addressed. Detailed analysis of system architecture is performed and comparison of performance results, specifically as they relate to IPv4 Forwarding and Triple-DES De/Encryption performance, show HANP architecture to be a promising solution.</description><creator>Danan, Yanai, 1976-</creator><contributor>Zilic, Zelkjo (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>HANP : a highly adaptive network processor</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pg15bh01j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dr26z029r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:f4752j75v</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Across Canada, municipalities have been struggling to alleviate the poverty of increasing numbers of homeless people and panhandlers on city streets. Simultaneously, tensions have risen between these street people and the general public. This thesis is a narrative study of the current conflict between panhandlers and other community stakeholders in Calgary, Alberta. This study presents the diverse viewpoints and voices of people who panhandle, homeless people, the general public, the downtown business community, social service providers, city bureaucrats and police officers. This study examines how identity politics and broader social ideologies shape face-to-face street encounters and influence debates over public policy at an institutional level. The relationship between panhandlers and the public is typically one marked by social distance. The current approach to panhandlers involves treating them as "strangers within our midst." This approach undermines their citizenship and heightens tensions within the community more so than would an approach that emphasizes their commonality with the larger society and their rights within civic space.</description><creator>Leech, Jessica F.</creator><contributor>Galaty, John (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Beggars -- Alberta -- Calgary</subject><subject>Calgary (Alta.) -- Social conditions</subject><subject>Homeless persons -- Alberta -- Calgary</subject><title>Strangers within our midst? : panhandling, identity and community conflict in Canada</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/02870x78d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f4752j75v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anthropology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vd66w164c</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis examines the attempts made by Carl Goerdeler, Ludwig Beck, Ernst von Weizsacker and Adam von Trott zu Solz to obtain the support of the British government in their effort to overthrow the Nazi regime between 1937 and 1940. The circumstances surrounding each mission are detailed, including the degree of readiness on the part of the German opposition for a coup d'etat and the particular form of support sought from the British to increase the chance of success in each case. Consideration is given to the factors which conditioned the British reaction to the resistance emissaries, including the British foreign policy imperatives of the moment, important events in European relations and the attitude and degree of influence wielded by the statesmen to whom the German resistance emissaries addressed themselves.</description><creator>Mason, Andrea, 1976-</creator><contributor>Hoffmann, Peter (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Germany -- Foreign relations -- Great Britain</subject><subject>Great Britain -- Foreign relations -- Germany</subject><subject>Anti-Nazi movement -- Germany</subject><title>Opponents of Hitler in search of foreign support : the foreign contacts of Carl Goerdeler, Ludwig Beck, Ernst von Weizsäcker and Adam von Trott zu Solz, 1937-1940</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v405sc14d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vd66w164c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k06989426</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The last decade has witnessed a substantial increase in the use of military airpower for peace enforcement. Coalition airstrikes in the 1991 Gulf War, the use of NATO airpower against Bosnian-Serbs in 1995 and Yugoslavia in 1999, and the use on US-led airpower in the recent conflict in Afghanistan, are all examples of this trend. The use of airpower presents important implications for the laws of armed conflict while having consequences for the internationally-sanctioned delivery of humanitarian relief to war victims. Has the use of airpower increasingly limited civilian casualties since the Gulf War? Are humanitarian operations possible doting coalition air campaigns? While centered on Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions and the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross, this thesis will identify and examine legal gaps and humanitarian tensions. An evaluation will be conducted of the behavior and results of coalition airpower and of relief agency access.</description><creator>Lemieux, Marc A.</creator><contributor>Brynen, Rex (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Humanitarian assistance</subject><subject>Air power</subject><subject>War (International law)</subject><title>From Baghdad to Kabul : the implications of coalition airpower for international humanitarian law and action</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6108vd37t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k06989426</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xd07gv54m</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis deals with the representation of emblem literature in digital media in the modern age. A discussion of issues related to new media such as the advantages and disadvantages of digital media as well as copyright issues is presented. There follows a discussion of different technologies related to modern means of publishing, notably Acrobat technology, HTML, XHTML, and XML, and how they could be best used to serve the goal of dealing with emblems by means of digital media. A discussion of digitizing and indexing emblems as well as CD-ROM technology is also presented. This leads to an evaluation of some Internet web sites and a CD-ROM edition. The thesis concludes with a summary evaluating the success of modern attempts of presenting emblem literature in modern digital media.</description><creator>Kotb, Mohamed</creator><contributor>Daly, Peter (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Richter, Horst (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Electronic records</subject><subject>Emblems</subject><subject>Information technology</subject><title>Emblems in the digital age</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ks65hf07p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xd07gv54m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of German Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bz60cz466</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Bund deutscher Madel (BdM), a Nazi youth organization for girls, was sponsored, organized, and promoted by Adolf Hitler's National Socialist Party. The BdM instilled values and beliefs of National Socialism in German girls, and encouraged attitudes and behavior in them that harmonized with Party views on womanhood. Political indoctrination for girls often came through music---especially song. Musical repertoire of the BdM strongly interconnects with the organization's development, internal structure and political philosophies. My thesis analyses the relations between music, the BdM, National Socialism, and gender. Historical perspectives are documented to clarify the function and intention of the BdM, including its politics and philosophy, its activities designed to foster 'natural' gender roles, and its emerging supremacy over other right-wing youth movements in Nazi Germany. My thesis then examines conceptions of 'natural' gender roles for girls and women in Nazi society and how these role expectations are covertly and overtly embedded in the official music book of the BdM, entitled Wir Madel singen! To illustrate this relationship between music, politics, and gender expectations, ten songs from Wir Madel singen! are analyzed in detail.</description><creator>Anderson, Rachel Jane</creator><contributor>Levitz, Tamara (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Musical analysis</subject><subject>Totalitarianism</subject><subject>Bund Deutscher Mädel</subject><subject>Gender identity in music</subject><title>Lieder, totalitarianism, and the Bund deutscher Mädel : girls' political coercion through song</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ks65hf08z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bz60cz466</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rb68xd590</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>My thesis studies rewriting in the works of Madeleine Ferron. I analyze passages Ferron took from her own writings and rewrote in later texts. Between 1960 and 1995, Ferron produced 114 texts; they include tales, short stories, articles, novels, ethnographic studies and biographies. The author rewrote twenty-two passages and four complete texts. My study describes and analyzes the functions of the rewriting process in these texts: it explores, among others, literary devices, thematic structures and the manner in which the rewritings determine editorial strategies. Rewriting is at the core of the Ferronian esthetic and is here characterized by the transposition of genres, and corresponding processes of fictionalization or defictionalization. I identify three stages in Madeleine Ferron's writing career: the early years (1960--1970), when Jacques Ferron (her brother, a well-known writer) rewrote Madeleine's texts, the period during which her major works were produced (1971--1989); and 1990 to 1995, the period that saw the publication of her most "personal" texts; these chronological divisions correspond to the three main chapters of this thesis.</description><creator>Bélanger, Danielle-Claude</creator><contributor>Everett, Jane (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Ferron, Madeleine, 1922- -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><title>Les modalités de réécriture chez Madeleine Ferron /</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/np193b858.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rb68xd590</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:00000202z</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is a reflection on the importance of the inspirited school and the value of living the great mythic questions. I am suggesting that we are living in a mythic and spiritual crisis that stems from an education informed by an uninspiring myth. While our traditional pedagogical aim has been to further the education of students, to develop their minds into keen and sharp tools capable of contributing to our economic society, we have forgotten to ask what that means exactly: what does it mean to be educated? Through an exploration of the roles spirituality, authenticity, and narrative play in education, this thesis proposes a vision of the inspirited school providing a rich alternative to the present myth. With authenticity as the goal of inspirited education, narrative and the writing process are the means by which to achieve this goal.</description><creator>Bosch, Marieke M.</creator><contributor>Morris, Ronald (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Education -- Philosophy.</subject><subject>Education -- Aims and objectives.</subject><subject>Spirituality.</subject><title>Living the great mythic questions : an exploration of the inspirited school where narrative and authenticity intersect</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7s75df47w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/00000202z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Integrated Studies in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q237ht68b</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis reviews the anthropological approaches to the study of the ethnic minorities in Southwest China.

The first contribution is the development of a modular, easy-to-use Time Warp simulation engine targeted towards distributed-memory environments. The second contribution is the analysis and experimental verification of the performance of the flow control algorithm proposed by Choe in a distributed-memory environment. The Time Warp simulation engine TWSIM provides our laboratory with a research medium for Time Warp simulations in a distributed-memory environment such as a network of workstations. The modular design of TWSIM allows for easy integration of any new simulation application and for fast testing of optimizations and improvements to the Time Warp mechanism. Its compact size and object-oriented implementation using the C++ programming language result in a short learning curve for future users and developers. The flow control algorithm proposed by Choe was implemented and analyzed with the aid of the TWSIM simulation engine. The algorithm makes use of stochastic learning automata to balance simulations loads by continuously regulating the flow of events between processors during the course of the simulation. Three different load metrics are considered: memory usage, virtual time, and a space-time product of the first two metrics. The algorithm was tested with two different simulation applications: a queuing network simulation and a Personal Communication Services (PCS) simulation. Results show that the flow control algorithm reduces the memory usage; the number of rollbacks and the number of antievents at the expense of the simulation time. As well, it becomes apparent that the behaviour of the flow control algorithm is not a consequence of learning. Finally, we discuss a number of approaches to learning and flow control using the outlines of the flow control algorithm, and we consider the extent of the performance improvement to be expected from memory-based schemes for limiting Time Warp optimism in a distributed-memory environment.</description><creator>Solomon, Luiza</creator><contributor>Tropper, Carl (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Learning and flow control in optimistic simulation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h702q8180.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/12579v17j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gt54kq09z</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Myelin-associated axon growth inhibitors such as Nogo and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) play an important role in the failure of axon regeneration in the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS). One strategy to neutralize these inhibitors is a vaccination approach using immunization with myelin in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA). In the present study, I compared the effectiveness of (i) immunizing with recombinant MAG/Nogo versus myelin, (ii) different adjuvants (IFA vs Alum) and (iii) different immunization frequencies for their capacity to promote spinal cord regeneration in adult SJL/J mice. The length of axon regeneration was similar in all the groups studied. However the robustness of the regenerative response, i.e., the number of axons that grew and the percentage of mice showing regeneration was greater in myelin treated groups. Alum also led to a greater degree of sprouting compared with. IFA. Finally, the two immunization frequencies tested were found to differentially affect the sprouting response. Compared to previous work on BALB/c mice, fewer regenerating fibers were seen in immunized SJL/J mice. This may be due to the greater depth of lesion in the present study as compared to earlier work or to possible differences in the mouse strains used. This work shows that immunizations with Alum as the adjuvant is as effective or better than IFA, and that immunization with the two known inhibitors (MAG/Nogo) is effective at promoting axon regeneration although not as much as with whole myelin.</description><creator>Sicotte, Maryline</creator><contributor>David, Samuel (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Characterization of immunization approaches to promote axon regeneration</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4m90dx31z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gt54kq09z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:b8515q321</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Historical environmental changes in two shallow, unstratified, estuaries in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts are compared, using three diatom paleo-production indicators: sedimentary biogenic silica (BSi), BSi flux and ratio of Centric to Penate diatoms. Both estuaries were exposed to pollution. New Bedford Harbor (NBH) has a history of intensive nutrient loading and industrial pollution, while the control site, Apponagansett Bay, has lower levels of nutrient loading. Consideration of local precipitation history and diatom parameters suggests that salinity-driven changes in diatom production are negligible. Over the past ~350 yrs, BSi concentrations and fluxes are higher in NBH. Thus, overall diatom production is sensitive to nutrient enrichment and less responsive to industrial pollutants. The relationship between the C/P ratio and environmental conditions is not as clear, possibly due to its dependence on eelgrass abundance. The uniqueness of this study lies in its use of the parameters combined, as well as its geographic setting.</description><creator>Spasojević, Zorana</creator><contributor>Chmura, Gail (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Pennales -- Massachusetts -- Buzzards Bay (Bay)</subject><subject>Silica -- Massachusetts -- Buzzards Bay (Bay)</subject><subject>Nutrient pollution of water -- Massachusetts -- Buzzards Bay (Bay)</subject><subject>Estuarine pollution -- Environmental aspects -- Massachusetts -- Buzzards Bay (Bay)</subject><subject>Coastal ecology -- Massachusetts -- Buzzards Bay (Bay)</subject><subject>Centrales -- Massachusetts -- Buzzards Bay (Bay)</subject><title>Biogenic silica and diatom centricpennate ratios as indicators of historical coastal pollution</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rx913r720.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b8515q321</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:m039k701t</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:53:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Neurotensin is a thirteen amino acid peptide that is found both in the central and peripheral nervous systems. In the CNS, it controls the synthesis and release of dopamine, modulates anterior pituitary hormone secretion, and provides non-opioid-receptor-dependent analgesia. In the gut, it modulates gastric acid secretion, pancreatic secretion, and colonic motility. In the immune system, it modulates IL-1 and mast cell secretion and stimulates macrophage phagocytosis. Neurotensin also acts as a growth factor for normal and cancer cells. Neurotensin mediates its effects through three neurotensin receptors: NTR1, NTR2, and NTR3. NTR1 and NTR2 belong to the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family, while NTR3 is a single transmembrane receptor identical to sortilin. NTR1 has the highest affinity for neurotensin (Kd of 0.1--0.3 nM). Internalization of GPCRs, including NTR1 and NTR2, was shown to play an important role in initiating signaling activity as well as in desensitizing and resensitizing the receptors. In this study, the internalization of the NTR1 was investigated.

We recently reported that fetal hGHRs appear to be relatively immature or have adapted to the in utero environment [194]. To further characterize these age-related differences, we have examined certain aspects of the hGHR structure as well as its signalling pathways. Initial cDNA sequencing and immunoblotting analyses showed no difference in hGHR molecular size. We then used RT-PCR to investigate levels of an alternatively spliced mRNA for a truncated (1--279) hGHR (T) which acts as a dominant negative to the full-length (FL) receptor; however, fetal hepatocytes showed T/FL ratios similar to postnatal liver (0.07 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.09 +/- 0.01, M +/- SEM). Western blotting was used to assess developmental differences in the relative abundance of downstream signalling factors. Stimulatory Jak and Stat proteins were detected in all fetal hepatocytes and postnatal livers tested (13 weeks fetal age to 62 years).
