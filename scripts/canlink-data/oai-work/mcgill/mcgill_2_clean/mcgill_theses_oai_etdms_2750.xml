It is shown that these image deformations can be performed and detected using the optimal basis operators derived from the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of H. Among other uses, the decomposition can convert the description of an image deformation into a matrix multiplication. The correspondence matrix is used to perform a variety of image transforms, including scale change, image plane rotation and translation. The methodology is also used to independently reproduce the steerable basis operators for the rotation of functions. The correspondence matrix framework is extended to recover the parameters of an image deformation model using appearance-based methods, producing a probability density function of model parameters in a local, strictly feed-forward, fashion. This method solves the inverse mapping problem by learning the forward mapping. One of the goals of this thesis is to show how much shape and motion information can be directly extracted from a scene by local inspection, leading directly to confidence bounds for the model parameters. As an example, oriented, 1-D receptive fields are synthesized to detect local surface shape and motion parameters within cross sections. The recovered local shape and motion parameters are sufficient to produce local estimates of time to collision, focus of expansion and optical flow without solving the global optimization problems of traditional methods.</description><creator>Benoit, Stephen M.</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Engineering - Electronics and Electrical</subject><title>Towards direct motion and shape parameter recovery from image sequences</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bn999882h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tm70mx66k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k0698969m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We consider the design and performance of CDMA-based multiuser detectors with partial information. Specifically, we assume that the multiuser signal presented to the receiver is contaminated by interference from sources whose parameters — power, delay, signature sequence — are unknown. The application we have in mind is to the uplink reception problem in CDMA cellular wireless, it being reasonable in such a setting to suppose that detailed parametric models of out-of-cell interferers may not be available to every base station. In the first part of the thesis, we propose forms of enhanced multiuser detectors with partial information, whose front end uses the covariance structure of the out-of-cell contribution to suppress interference prior to multiuser signal detection. The proposal, amenable to adaptive as well as non-adaptive implementation, features a bank of linear equalizers at the input, and either a maximum-likelihood (ML) sequence detector or a linear detector at the output. Computational complexity, given the size of the detection group, is independent of the total number of active users. The second part of the thesis evaluates the performance of the proposed receiver structures, both for the AWGN channel and for the multi-path channel with slow Rayleigh fading. The evaluation criteria include mean squared error, effective signal-to-noise ratio, probability of bit error, asymptotic efficiency and near-far resistance. The results, functions not only of the channel parameters but of the particular character of the side information assumed available, provide an expanded view of the performance tradeoffs available in the application of multiuser detectors. The proposed receivers are observed to be near-far resistant and superior to enhanced singleuser detectors. The ML-based variants that we studied outperform the linear ones, the performance difference being especially significant when parameter information is incomplete or MAI is severe. Bit error rate decreases with the size of the detection group, and falls off rapidly with the number of resolved multi-path components. Comparison of short and long spreading in our numerical experiments suggest that short spreading is less sensitive to incompletely characterized interference.</description><creator>Zhang, Liqing</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Engineering - Electronics and Electrical</subject><title>Multiuser detection and performance evaluation for cellular DS-CDMA networks with partial information</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/th83m173x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k0698969m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:s1784n89q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:26:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A new QoS routing mechanism is proposed for MPLS capable networks to achieve global optimal route selection. The functional capabilities, which are necessary for optimizing bandwidth allocation and route selection, are identified and modeled. We focus on the design of an appropriate algorithm to combine label-switching technologies with State-Dependent routing. The algorithm, which takes into account resource utilization cost (RUC) and all available routes, is believed to be able to accomplish superior network utilization and quality of service. We devise both a centralized and a decentralized routing mechanism. The performances of both routing mechanisms are simulated and the results are analyzed.

The energy and reserves from both supply and demand side are scheduled and dispatched in a joint auction through a mixed-integer optimization program. Among the advantages of this more general electricity market, due to the extra flexibility introduced by the demand-side reserve offers, the consumers' profits increase while themarket power of the generators is reduced.

These OTFTs were fabricated on heavily doped «-type silicon wafers with thermally grown silicon dioxide layer was used as gate insulator. Except for MEH-PPV, the OTFTs studied in this work are the first for the above organic semiconductor materials. From results of current-voltage measurements, it was observed that the present OTFTs showed I-V characteristics of typical /^-channel thin film transistors. Some of the fabricated OTFTs showed performance with relatively large field-effect mobilities (&gt;10~4 cm2 V"1 s"1). The mobility of semiconducting polymer with polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) was at least one order of magnitude larger than that of parent polymer without the POSS. The largest mobility value was obtained on poly-TPD-POSS (4.34 x 10"4 cm2 V"1 s"1) in room atmosphere and at room temperature. Thermal annealing under different conditions was carried out on the polymers and the effects on carrier field-effect mobilities were examined. The thermal annealing can increase slightly the field-effect mobilities of the polymers without POSS. However, no significant effect was observed on the field-effect mobilities of the polymers with POSS.</description><creator>Zhu, Wen Wei</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Engineering - Electronics and Electrical</subject><title>Organic thin film transistors</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p8418q35m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pc289m16x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:08612q83r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:26:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The present study examined the emotional responses of 112 dyads of same-sex friends in early and middle childhood as they competed against each other on 3 identical games, enabling each child in the pair to experience 3 outcome conditions: winning, losing, and tying. Emotional reactions were videotaped and rated for degree of enjoyment and discomfort. In addition, following the 3 games, children were individually interviewed and asked to report their levels of happiness regarding winning, losing, and tying. The social context of a dyad is more closely associated with female social interaction which tends to be egalitarian. It was hypothesized that boys' well-documented greater comfort with competition relative to girls would be attenuated in the context of a dyad. Results indicated that boys showed more comfort and enjoyment throughout the competitive process than did girls. However, both boys and girls showed equal levels of comfort and enjoyment for the win and tie outcomes, indicating boys, like girls, were also concerned with doing the same as their friend. A developmental difference was also seen as the children in middle childhood reported less happiness than the kindergarten children when they experienced the win outcome. The results are discussed in terms of the necessity of considering the social context in which competition occurs when investigating gender differences in competition.</description><creator>Linders, Lisa M.</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Psychotherapy -- Outcome assessment.</subject><subject>Sex differences (Psychology) in children.</subject><title>Gender differences in responses to differential outcomes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mc87ps745.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/08612q83r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5q47rq934</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:26:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The notions of risk, resilience, and acculturation were examined among a group of First Nations adolescents from a community in Northern Quebec. These adolescents are at high-risk for emotional and behavioural problems due to both their minority status and the remoteness of their locale. Accordingly, the research on risk and resilience in innercity youths was adapted to study this unique group of First Nations youths. The aims of the study were relevant to issues of adolescent wellness. The first aim was to identify the factors that help protect against the maladaptive outcomes associated with minority group status and living in a remote area. The protective factors included intelligence, ego development, and attachment. The second aim was to examine subtypes of acculturation and the differences between acculturation subtypes among these youths. The acculturation strategy of integration was expected to result in the best adaptation whereas that of marginalization was expected to lead to difficulties across the domains of social competence. The third aim was to examine competence over time, as problems in one domain tend to be related to later problems in other domains. A series of paper and pencil questionnaires were completed in classroom settings by 67 adolescents aged 11 to 19 years and their teachers. Specific patterns of resilience across domains of functioning were found. High levels of intelligence protected against diminished school performance but not against depressive symptomatology. Strong attachment relationships protected against depression and poor school performance. Acculturative strategy also protected against negative outcomes despite high stress living situation. However, positive outcome was not uniform across all domains of social competence, which is consistent with the notion of domain specificity of resilience. Not one individual who participated in this study, despite the benefit of protective factors, showed high levels of social competence across all domains. This argues for the inherent risk of living in a high stress neighbourhood. The information is relevant to furthering our understanding of First Nations youths and their families, and advances the literatures on risk and resilience in its application to a relatively unique community.</description><creator>Klaiman, Cheryl M.</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Naskapi Indians -- Québec (Province) -- Schefferville.</subject><subject>Resilience (Personality trait) in adolescence.</subject><subject>Schefferville (Québec)</subject><subject>Teenagers -- Québec (Province) -- Schefferville.</subject><subject>Problem youth -- Québec (Province) -- Schefferville</subject><subject>Acculturation.</subject><title>From nomadic to static : issues of acculturation and resilience among First Nations youths</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3b591b62s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5q47rq934</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:j67316200</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:26:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The current study examined the hypothesis that in the presence of a stressor, the social context (dyad relationship versus a group relationship) can influence whether children and adolescents display internalizing as opposed to externalizing emotions and behaviors. Specifically, it was hypothesized that more internalizing relative to externalizing behaviors would be reported to occur in a dyad than a group. Three hundred and eighty-six children and adolescents (176 females and 210 males) from three grade levels (1,5, and 10) participated in the study. A measure was developed to simulate, as closely as possible, two realistic stressful events that might typically arise in the daily lives of school age children and adolescents. Participants were asked to rate how other children their age and gender would respond in these situations, with the intention of tapping into children and adolescents' knowledge of the occurrence of internalizing versus externalizing responses. The findings partially supported the hypothesis that the social context regulates expectations for emotional and behavioral responses to the same stressor in children and adolescents. Following a conflict, both female and male participants reported expecting higher rates of internalizing relative to externalizing emotions and behaviors for the target individuals in the dyadic versus group context.</description><creator>Dolenszky, Eva</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Interpersonal conflict in adolescence.</subject><subject>Interpersonal conflict in children.</subject><subject>Behavioral assessment of children.</subject><subject>Behavioral assessment of teenagers.</subject><title>Social context regulates internalizing versus externalizing responses in children and adolescents during interpersonal conflict</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b2773x849.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j67316200</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5m60qv11b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:26:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The 1994 CSA Standard requires that slab-column connections be designed for one-way shear and two-way shear action.

In 1990, the CO2 emission from fossil fuel fired power plants contributed 30% of global emissions. In the same year, the cement industry contributed about 5% of the total. According to Kyoto Protocol, a tremendous effort is required to reduce the carbon dioxide emission. One potential technology in CO2 mitigation responses is the use of concrete products as carbon sink through the early age fast curing. The cement compounds C3S and C2S are instantaneously carbonized into calcium carbonate and silica gel, once cement is mixed with water and exposed to the carbon dioxide gas. If it works, concrete production lines can be set next to the power plants or cement kilns to produce the concrete products using the captured CO2 as curing agent. This thesis reports a feasibility study based on a preliminary work. The purpose of the research was to find a proper combination of a large number parameters to use cement, slag or waste cement to sequester CO2 emitted from industrial point sources, and at the same time to make high performance concrete products. In order to understand the carbonation curing, this study was directed towards the mix designs, carbonation conditions and the mechanical properties of carbonated products. More than 40 batches of carbonated concrete specimens were prepared with the following variables in their preparation: chemical additive, CO2 concentration, carbonation time, carbonation pressure, thickness of specimen, and CO2 supply method. The performance of the carbonated specimens was assessed through the mass gain, the compressive strength, the bending strength, the pressure drop, the temperature rise in the curing chamber, the carbonation depth and the microstructure characteristics. Two-hour carbonated concrete products can have a strength equivalent to 2-month air curing, and take up 8% carbon dioxide by weight without special treatment.</description><creator>Ye, Gang</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Engineering - Civil</subject><title>Carbon dioxide uptake by concrete through early-age curing</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q237ht92d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bg257h13k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5x21th63w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:26:08Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>An important aspect of Diophantine Approximation deals with the problem of approximating real or complex numbers by rational numbers or, more generally, by algebraic numbers of bounded degree.

Following Davenport &amp; Schmidt we look at the approximation of a real number by rational numbers, by quadratic irrational numbers and by algebraic integers of degree at most 3. We also look at the related problem of simultaneous approximation of a real number and its square by rational numbers with  the same denominator.

We focus on two numerical methods : the symplectic Euler method andan explicit variant of it. We first state under which conditions they are symplectic andwe prove they are both Poisson integrators for the Lotka-Volterra system. Then, westudy under which conditions they stay positive. For the symplectic Euler method,we derive a simple condition under which the numerical approximation always stayspositive. For the explicit variant, there is no such simple condition. Using propertiesof Poisson integrators and backward error analysis, we prove that for initial conditionsin a given set in the positive quadrant, there exists a bound on the step size, such thatnumerical approximations with step sizes smaller than the bound stay positive overexponentially long time intervals. We also show how this bound can be estimated.We illustrate all our results by numerical experiments.</description><creator>Beck, Mélanie</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Pure Sciences - Mathematics</subject><title>Symplectic methods applied to the Lotka-Volterra system</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b5644t774.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1j92g953n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mg74qp30b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:26:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis describes the creation of a dynamics model of an autonomous underwater vehicle. Motion equations are integrated to obtain the position and velocity of the vehicle. External forces acting on the vehicle, such as hull and control plane hydrodynamic forces, are predicted for the full 360° angle of attack range. This enables the simulation of high angle of attack situations. An accurate through-body thruster model is also incorporated into the simulation. The vehicle model is validated using experimental turning diameters of the ARCS vehicle.</description><creator>Evans, Jason P.</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical</subject><subject>Engineering - Mechanical</subject><title>Dynamics modeling and performance evaluation of an autonomous underwater vehicle</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3j333451r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mg74qp30b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0p0969375</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:26:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Computer simulations play a significant role in the development and operation of space systems because of the difficulty in performing ground-based hardware testing and onorbit tests are impossible before the launch of these systems. Hence, accurate modeling and simulation of space robotic tasks involving contact is very crucial. This in turn implies that accurate model (contact) parameters, used as inputs to the software to represent the contact operation being simulated, are imperative. In this work, we addressed the contact parameter estimation problem for simple contacting geometries (one-point contact) and complex contacting geometries (multiple-point contact). Several frequency domain identification strategies were applied to one-point contact parameter estimation problem to estimate contact stiffness and damping. The performance of these frequency domain algorithms was evaluated and compared with time domain identification algorithms. The identification algorithm for multiple point contact scenario to estimate contact stiffness, damping and coefficient of friction was also investigated. We determined the cause for poor estimation results obtained with previous implementation of this identification algorithm and were able to improve the performance of the algorithm. Finally, a thorough evaluation of sensitivity of the algorithm to noise in measured data was conducted.</description><creator>Patel, Ketan</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Engineering - Mechanical</subject><title>Frequency and time domain contact parameter estimation for space robotic operations</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c821gn182.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0p0969375</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h128ng907</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:26:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A general treatment which includes special cases of the five poses planar four-bar synthesis problem is investigated. There are 0, 2, or 4 real solutions to this problem formulated with five simultaneous equations. This method exposes solutions containing RR, PR, or RP dyads. The kinematic mapping is used to represent planar constraint equations in a three-dimensional projective image space because it offers a comprehensive way to solve problems in kinematic synthesis. The motion of a planar rigid body under a RR constraint can be mapped to points on a skew one-sheet hyperboloid with circles as generators which are generated by intersecting the hyperboloid with planes parallel to X3 = 0 in the image space. Similarly, a RP or PR dyad generates points on a unique hyperbolic paraboloid ruled by lines when intersected with planes parallel to X3 = 0. The five-pose four-bar linkage synthesis problem leads to five second-order constraint equations. By solving the constraint equations for RR dyads or four constraint equations for a RP or a PR dyad, four-bar linkage design parameters can be computed. In this thesis, examples which produce two RR dyads, four RR dyads and one RR dyad with one RP dyad will be analyzed. Furthermore, an approximate solution, with kinematic mapping, is given to the planar elliptical trammel synthesis problem.</description><creator>Qiao, Guirong</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Engineering - Mechanical</subject><title>Unification of planar linkage synthesis through kinematic mapping</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hh63sz13d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h128ng907</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9p290c73x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:26:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Speed-o-Cam, a family of speed-reduction mechanisms based on cams and pure-rolling contact, is currently under development at McGill University's Centre for Intelligent Machines. This family is intended to replace gears and harmonic drives in applications where backlash, friction, and flexibility cannot be tolerated. In this thesis, we focus on the internal and external planar Speed-o-Cam with both positive and negative actions. We introduce 2-4-6 and 2-4-6-8 polynomials to modify the cam profile around both the cusp and the blunt point of the profile to improve the cam dynamic and kinematic performance. In a third approach, we resort to a cubic spline to solve the same problem. We pay special attention to the curvature of the cam, especially in  connection with its machinability. To this end, we resort to Fourier analysis and, thus, propose the concept of loss of geometric regularity, which measures curvature changes. Then, we propose one more concept, the effective machinability of a cam. Both machinability and effective machinability vary from 0% to 100%. We also study the pressure-angle distribution and derive the relationships between the pressure angle and the parameters of the cam. A method to decrease the pressure angle under negative action is introduced. Moreover, an application of Speed-o-Cam to the design of the driving units of wheeled mobile robots is reported in the thesis.</description><creator>Zhang, Weimin</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Engineering - Mechanical</subject><title>Cam-profile optimization by means of undercutting in cam-roller speed reducers</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5m60qv12m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9p290c73x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9k41zg68d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:26:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is a critical examination of the history of philosophies governing public education in the United States. The first half, chapters one through six, outlines American conceptions of the role of the school in relation to the state and to democracy. The second half is an account of critical progressive philosophies that have challenged the American status-quo since the independence. The main argument that I propose here is that the creation of an education system in America has followed the philosophies of federalism and private democracy. These philosophies are economically centered and define the citizen in economic terms. Progressive educators have long questioned this definition and seek to redefine citizenship to describe participatory democracy, and communication based on experience and an ethic of care.</description><creator>Obare, Lynette Adhiambo</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Forest management -- Decision making -- Sex differences. -- Kenya</subject><subject>Geographic information systems -- Kenya.</subject><subject>Forest management -- Citizen participation -- Sex differences. -- Kenya</subject><title>Forest user needs, gender, and geographic information systems : an integrative approach to managing the Forest of the Lost Child</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n009w459w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9k41zg68d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:f4752j99f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:26:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Although deflectors are commonly used in fish habitat rehabilitation projects to create and/or maintain pools, there is a lack of understanding of the complex flow field and scour patterns around these structures. The objective of this research is to quantify the 3D flow dynamics and the bed morphology around various designs of flow deflectors in a laboratory flume over a plain and mobile bed. 3D velocity measurements were taken with an acoustic Doppler velocimeter. After comparing different methods of bed shear stress estimates, it was determined that the turbulent kinetic energy approach was best at capturing the shear stress amplification near the deflectors. Deflectors oriented perpendicular to the flow create the most important disturbance of the flow field, the greatest increase in turbulence intensity and the largest scour hole, followed by upstreamoriented deflectors (135°) and downstream-oriented ones (45°). 90° deflectors would therefore potentially provide the greatest benefit for fish habitat rehabilitation.</description><creator>Robson, Colleen</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Flumes.</subject><subject>Fish habitat improvement.</subject><title>Three-dimensional flow dynamics and bed morphology around deflectors in a laboratory flume</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3x816p67g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f4752j99f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8w32r773d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:26:14Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Obtaining equations of motion is quite demanding but indispensable for the simulation of a multibody system, especially in space applications. This thesis is devoted to establishing a dynamics formalism and modeling tool in the framework of the objectoriented method for flexible multibody systems in a tree topology. In order to manage the modular construct as well as to take the material flexibility of body into account, the formulations are based on the Euler-Lagrange method in conjunction with the natural orthogonal complement of the kinematic constraint matrix. The elements constituting the dynamics of multibody mechanical systems are identified under the standard mathematical formats. They are embodied into distinct object modules equipped with characteristic variables and operations. A general flexible body is decomposed into several components with the kinematics and kinetics objects, while various types of articulation are delimited as the joint objects. The free-floating condition is represented by a special joint object having six degrees of freedom. A dynamics model is achieved by the interconnection of the object modules according to the relationships for data flow. A recursion formula, in conjunction with the lower body index representation, systematically evaluates the natural orthogonal complement matrix, which leads to a minimal set of equations of motion. The proposed method has been implemented to yield a practical modeling tool. It is validated through various simulation cases. The results match with the solutions of explicit formulations as well as the outputs from a sophisticated functional simulation facility. Additional simulations are performed with the incorporation of a control scheme.</description><creator>Min, Byung No</creator><date>2002</date><subject>Engineering - Mechanical</subject><title>Object-oriented modeling for the dynamics of tree-topological flexible multibody systems</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vm40xt94d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8w32r773d</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6t053j29b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:26:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of the thesis is twofold. The first objective is to illustrate the philosophy of Cesare Beccaria through the study of his articles on II caffe and his major work On crimes and punishments. The author presents a conceptual and practical solution to two problems: the administration of justice and the foundation of law. The second objective of the thesis is to retrace the steps of the international spread of his thought in France and the Anglo-Saxon world: France is only concerned with the administration of justice; England is responsive to both the concepts of the Italian scholar through William Blackstone (justice) and Jeremy Bentham (law). Bentham finds in the theory of the social contract of Beccaria the principle of Utilitarianism, a social philosophy that he will develop.

This thesis updates the literature by explaining the remarkable story of the last several years: the achievement of a national unity peace in the absence of constitutional reform. The explanation centres on the post-referendum shift in federal strategy from constitutional reform to Plan B, a strategy based on the rules of secession that has its origins, it is argued, in the Reform Party's response to Mulroneyera constitutional reform. The thesis concludes that Plan B was a successful national unity strategy because it made secession seem risky and undesirable, but also because the strategy - unlike constitutional reform - was based on widespread national support and on the viability of the constitutional status quo.</description><creator>Butcher, Edward</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Canada -- Politics and government -- 1993-.</subject><subject>Québec (Province) -- History -- Autonomy and independence movements</subject><subject>Constitutional law -- Canada.</subject><title>Searching for a national unity peace, from Meech Lake to the Clarity Bill</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vq27zq75q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f1881p25m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:c247dv33p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:26:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Amphiphilic copolymers of hydrophobic Disperse Red 1 acrylate (DR1A) and hydrophilic acrylic acid (AA) were dissolved in THF and a H2O/THF co-solvent series. The thermal cis-trans isomerization behavior of the azo groups was measured by means of flash photolysis to investigate self-assembled structure in solution. The rate constants observed for the azo-containing polymers permit an estimation of how the thermal isomerization is influenced by both polymer and solution properties. In pure THF the relaxation can be analyzed by a monoexponential decay. In aqueous-organic solutions all poly(DRlA-co-AA) samples show a slow isomerization process due to inhibited mobility of the azo groups, preceded by a faster isomerization process for unaggregated azo groups. In such cases, the relaxation of the cz's-isomer was fit to a biexponential function which clearly demonstrates two distinct local chromophore environments. The spectroscopic results of this study suggest that weakly aggregated states of the amphiphilic polymers in an aqueous-organic solution can be readily studied through isomerization spectroscopy to estimate the fractions of aggregated groups involved and their local environment.</description><creator>Norman, Lana Laurette</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Chemistry - Organic</subject><title>Solution properties of self-assembling azo aromatic polymers</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k930c049v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c247dv33p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4q77ft63r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:26:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Soil quality guidelines are currently based on total trace metal loads. There is a need to define indices of bioavailability to allow reasonable predictions for plant metal uptake and toxicity in soils. Trace metal toxicities to plants often correlate best with free metal ion activities. The first objective was to develop a plant bioassay that is sensitive to trace metals at concentrations realistic for soils. The root elongation of lettuce Lactuca sativa 'Buttercrunch' was used as toxicological endpoint. This endpoint was sensitive and reproducible to environmentally relevant concentrations of Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn. The second objective was to test whether free metal ion activities are constant predictors of metal toxicities in synthetic solutions and in soil extracts that differ in their concentrations of cations and ligands. The root elongation assay was used to test this hypothesis. In synthetic solutions, the rhizotoxicity of Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn decreased with increasing Ca and H concentrations. This could not be explained with the effect of higher cationic concentrations on root growth or on solution speciation. It was concluded that Ca and H inhibited the rhizotoxicity of all metals tested. The rhizotoxicity of Cu and Cd was further examined in soil extracts. Both metals became less rhizotoxic at higher H and dissolved organic matter concentrations. The rhizotoxicity endpoints from the experiments in synthetic solution were used to develop parameters for a Biotic Ligand Model (BLM) for Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn. The BLM accounts for solution speciation and interprets cationic inhibition of rhizotoxicity as competition of metals with Ca and H for potential sites of rhizotoxicity. The BLM predicted metal rhizotoxicity better than the free metal ion activity in synthetic solutions and in soil extracts. Different models were tested against literature rhizotoxicity data for metals at different Ca and H concentrations. Predictions for metal rhizotoxicity given by BLM, Gouy-Chapman-Stern model and Freundlich equation model were compared with predictions based on free metal ion activities in solution. The BLM predicted rhizotoxicity most accurately. The BLM seems promising for predictions of metal toxicity and metal bioavailability in soils to support site-specific environmental risk assessments.</description><creator>Voigt, Astrid</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Soils -- Trace element content.</subject><subject>Plant bioassay.</subject><subject>Plants -- Effect of trace elements on.</subject><subject>Trace elements -- Bioavailability.</subject><title>Bioavailability of trace metals to plants</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5q47rq94d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4q77ft63r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k930c050m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:26:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Extensive data sets of water quality and sediment chemistry as well as detailed historical records were used to analyze environmental factors controlling dinoflagellate cyst distribution in shallow estuaries (lagoons and embayments) of southern New England. Cyst abundance, species richness, the proportion of cysts produced by heterotrophic and autotrophic dinoflagellates, and the composition of cyst assemblages reflect spatial and temporal variation in environmental conditions. The cyst record in sediment cores from two embayments, New Bedford Harbor and Apponagansett Bay, Massachusetts demonstrates cyst sensitivity to environmental change caused by anthropogenic activity in the watersheds. Intensive industrialization and urbanization occurred during the 20th century in New Bedford Harbor resulted in extreme eutrophication and toxic pollution (heavy metals and PCBs). These conditions are reflected in declining cyst diversity and wide fluctuation in total cyst production. At the same time, the proportion of certain heterotrophic taxa increases. As impacts of extreme eutrophication and toxic pollution cannot be separated, the cyst response must be interpreted as a cumulative «pollution signal». The spatial distribution of modern dinoflagellate cysts in the area supports this signal. Cysts vary along gradients of nutrient enrichment, corresponding to distance from sewage outfalls. Dinoflagellate cysts in surface sediments from New England lagoons also were studied. A comparison of assemblages to water quality parameters, that are affected greatly by the degree of water exchange between lagoon and ocean, indicates that temperature and salinity are the main abiotic factors controlling cyst distribution in these estuaries. A new species of dinoflagellate cyst, Islandinium brevispinosum, has been identified and described. This species was found within a narrow range of water temperature and salinity, and at elevated nutrient levels. Dinoflagellate cysts reflect environmental conditions at the small spatial scales necessary to characterize variability within estuaries. However, the relative importance of abiotic factors controlling the spatial and temporal distribution of dinoflagellate cysts is likely to vary with the hydrological differences between lagoons and embayments. Therefore, dinoflagellate cysts can be useful indicators of environmental conditions in and human impacts on shallow estuaries.</description><creator>Pospelova, Vera</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Estuarine eutrophication -- New England.</subject><subject>Dinoflagellate cysts -- Effect of water pollution on -- New England.</subject><subject>Dinoflagellate cysts -- Geographical distribution. -- New England</subject><subject>Estuarine pollution -- New England.</subject><title>Dinoflagellate cyst assemblages and environmental factors controlling their distribution in New England (USA) estuaries</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h415pc72j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k930c050m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):2775</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
