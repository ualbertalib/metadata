Four laboratory studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of organic amendments on reducing NH$ sb3$ loss from liquid hog manure (LHM). The organic amendments used in these studies were sugar, sawdust and paper products including filter paper (FP), paper bag (PB), newsprint (NP) and pulp sludge (PS). Generally, organic amendments had significant effects on reducing NH$ sb3$ loss from LHM and their effectiveness increased with increasing addition rates. Sugar addition of 3% or higher could eliminate the NH$ sb3$ loss, depending on LHM properties and incubation conditions. The effectiveness of sugar, especially lower rates, decrease with time. The unrecovered NH$ sb4$ loss increased and manure pH decreased with the increase in sugar rates, indicating that the reduction in NH$ sb3$ loss due to sugar addition may have been caused by N immobilization and pH reduction. Sawdust addition reduced the NH$ sb3$ loss by as much as 20% compared to the control. The mixture of 5.5% sugar and 5% sawdust was more effective in reducing NH$ sb3$ loss than 5.5% sugar alone but, lower sugar rates were not similarly affected by sawdust addition. Addition of 5% FP, PB, NP and PS resulted in the decrease in NH$ sb3$ loss by as much as 40, 47, 37 and 29% in comparison to the non-amended manure. The unrecovered NH$ sb4 sp+$ loss and the loss of added C increased with increasing C addition, indicating that N immobilization may be the cause of the decrease in NH$ sb3$ due to paper product additions.

Proteins were isolated from skim milk by the addition of acid, with or without heating. The separation and isolation gave the following coconut protein preparations: coconut milk, coconut skim milk, insoluble solids, acid precipitate, and acid-heat precipitate. Trypsin inhibitory activity (TIA) of the coconut protein preparations was relatively low while tryptic digestibility of the isolated proteins was considerably lower than those of the coconut milk and skim milk, the digestibility of coconut protein preparations was lower than that of casein. In general, the emulsifying and farming properties of coconut protein preparations were lower than casein. The insoluble solids showed the highest viscosity when compared with the coconut protein preparations. In contrast to the whey protein concentrate (WPC), the apparent strain of gels from the acid precipitate increased as the pH increased. The gelation properties at pH 3 of the insoluble solids were better than WPC. The estimated molecular weight by size-exclusion chromatography of coconut protein preparations gave 3 fractions with MW ranging from 6850 Da to 229402 Da. In native PAGE, coconut proteins were separated into at least 3 subunits and under SDS-denatured conditions, the major protein subunits showed MW of 54531 Da and 25008 Da, respectively. RP-HPLC separation of coconut milk, acid precipitate, and acid-heat precipitate gave 3 fractions containing several species of MW ranging between 35574 Da to 51209 Da when analyzed by mass spectometry.</description><creator>Sumual, Maria Fransisca</creator><date>1994</date><subject>Coconut.</subject><subject>Proteins -- Separation.</subject><subject>Plant proteins -- Analysis.</subject><title>Fractionation and characterization of proteins from coconut milk</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k643b3251.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ns064790c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:s1784n82s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:07:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Brown Norway rats show increased airway smooth muscle content following repeated allergen challenges. Macrophages synthesize many growth factors in vitro which potentially stimulate proliferation of airway smooth muscle cells. Leukotriene C$ sb4$, an important mediator of allergic airway responses, can stimulate macrophages to release platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) which is a potent stimulator of proliferation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of the macrophage in the proliferative response of airway smooth muscle cells leading to airway remodelling. Macrophages were harvested from 7- to 9-week-old male Brown Norway rats, allowed to adhere to plastic 25cm$ sp2$ culture flasks for 25 minutes, rinsed with sterile PBS at 37$ sp circ$C to wash off cells other than macrophages and maintained in short-term culture in serum-free medium. Airway smooth muscle cells were also harvested and cultured. Supernatant from macrophages significantly stimulated airway smooth muscle cell proliferation 5-fold as compared to controls (p $&lt;$ 0.05). This stimulation was affected neither by the addition of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor ASA, nor by the addition of the LTD$ sb4$ inhibitor MK-571. However, stimulation was decreased by the addition of the PDGF inhibitor suramin, as well as by an anti-PDGF polyclonal antibody. Maximal inhibition observed with antibody was 34% (p $&lt;$ 0.01). We conclude that macrophages have the ability to stimulate airway smooth muscle cell proliferation by releasing growth factors, that one of these growth factors is PDGF, and that PDGF contributes 34% of the total airway smooth muscle cell proliferation. Therefore, it is likely that macrophages play an important role in airway remodelling and that this airway remodelling may be an important component in the pathology of asthma.

Synoptic class air quality signatures are examined on an annual, seasonal and interannual basis. Residual cumulative dose analysis confirms that the "Back of the High" synoptic types are responsible for above average ozone concentrations in the summer months. In contrast, during the winter, the stable conditions and cold temperatures associated with these same synoptic types promote ozone scavenging and below average ozone concentrations. Above average winter ozone levels are associated with cyclonic synoptic types, possibly as a result of stratospheric ozone intrusion. Synoptic sequencing confirms the importance in stability in upper level features (particularly an upper level trough to the northeast of Montreal) and stagnation of surface features (primarily the "Back of the High") for the development of elevated ozone concentrations in Montreal. Finally, a declimatizing technique is evaluated as a means of removing the synoptic signal from the ozone time series. Results of this study are in broad agreement with similar investigations elsewhere in northeastern North America.</description><creator>Stephens, Kate, 1968-</creator><contributor>McKendry, Ian (advisor)</contributor><contributor>Lewis, John (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Ozone</subject><subject>Synoptic climatology -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</subject><title>A synoptic climatology of ground-level ozone for Montreal, Quebec</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8049g7144.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d504rn400</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ft848s599</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:07:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Internet has been conceived as a communication tool to cross geographical boundaries and allow knowledge to be shared among people from all over the world. As a consequence of the expansion of computer networks, the abundance of available information and its variety make the process of resource discovery crucial for many people coming from different backgrounds, who often do not have computer skills. Resource Discovery Services (RDSs) have been developed along with almost every kind of resource, in order to enable access to each specific information pool. Among these services, the most popular are Archie, WAIS, Gopher and WWW, each performing better certain functions rather than others, even though their functionality sometimes overlaps. Inexperienced users are seldom aware of the efficiency of a particular service given a certain task and even less willing to use different tools, each one with its own characteristics. This work is concerned with the presentation of the most common RDSs, followed by the design and implementation of a system called World Information Tool (WIT), able to group existing RDSs and offer to the user the capability of exploiting them in a single, composite tool. The approach considered by WIT involves only the client side of the RDSs model, without requiring any modifications of the existing servers and protocols. Moreover, the geographical display of the servers permits a better use of the network resources, by attempting to spread the workload among different servers and make users choose nearby servers.

The Hart-Jaune Terrane is composed of interbanded two-pyroxene/plagioclase mafic granulites and quartzofeldspathic gneisses, which are probably supracrustal, and of granulitic gabbros. Gneissic banding generally trends NNE with moderately steep southerly dips, and contains a SSW-plunging pyroxene mineral lineation that is parallel to the axes of intrafolial folds. These structures are rotated into the bounding Hart-Jaune and Gabriel shear zones about an axis parallel to the inferred direction of motion along the shear zones. Metamorphism of the Hart-Jaune Terrane has resulted in the development of 3 distinct metamorphic assemblages. These are best preserved in mafic rocks and are: (1) an early high temperature granoblastic dry granulite assemblage which is intimately associated with anatectic melts dated at ca. 1.47 Ga (granulite-A); (2) a higher-pressure/lower temperature dry granulite assemblage in which garnet grows as rims between phases of the granulite-A assemblage (granulite-b); (3) a hydrated assemblage in which garnet and biotite grow in mafic rocks of the Hart-Jaune Terrane (@ ca..99 Ga) as a result of hydration along faults of the Gabriel Fault system. The granulite-A assemblage probably reflects high-T and relatively low-P metamorphism that occurred during crustal thinning, probably related to rifting during geon 14. The high-P granulite-B assemblage probably reflects a subsequent crustal thickening event. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)</description><creator>St-Jean, J. Alger</creator><contributor>Hynes, A.

In Experiment I, using electrolytic lesions, it was found that damage to the lateral but not central or basolateral nuclei blocked a Conditioned Cue Preference (CCP) to food (Froot Loops) in rats that were not deprived of food. In Experiment II, also using electrolytic lesions, it was found that damage to the basolateral but not central or lateral nuclei blocked a Conditioned Cue Aversion (CCA) produced by a lithium chloride injection (42 mg/kg). In Experiment III results similar to those in Experiments I and II were obtained using axon-sparing NMDA lesions. The results of Experiments I-III demonstrate a double dissociation of affective memory with respect to the amygdala. The lateral nucleus of the amygdala mediated the memory of an appetitive affective experience and the basolateral nucleus mediated memory for an aversive affective experience. In Experiment IV the contributions of appetitive and aversive affective states to a food CCP were examined. Lesions of the lateral but not the basolateral nucleus were found to attenuate but not completely eliminate a food CCP when the rats were food deprived in the Paired compartment and sated in the Unpaired compartment. Food deprivation alone produced a CCA and lesions of the basolateral but not the lateral nucleus blocked this effect. The possibility that both the appetitive and aversive behaviours are mediated through connections from the dopamine-reward centres in the ventral striatum is discussed.</description><creator>Sovran, Peter</creator><contributor>White, Norman (advisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Rats -- Behavior.</subject><subject>Affect (Psychology)</subject><subject>Amygdaloid body.</subject><subject>Conditioned response.</subject><title>A behavioural and anatomical investigation of amygdaloid mediation of affective memory</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/br86b5432.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8s45qb90t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wp988n157</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:07:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The ecology of Protocalliphora parasitism was studied for a two-year period in two species of cavity nesting passerine birds breeding in southwestern Quebec, the eastern bluebird (Sialia sialis Linnaeus) and the tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor Vieillot). Both species occupied next boxes in open field habitats. Nests were parasitized primarily by Protocalliphora sialia Shannon and Dobroscky. The relationship between the number of Protocalliphora larvae per nest and selected nesting variables was examine for the two species. The variables included hatching date of the host young, nest material volume, number of fledglings, and percent canopy cover above the nest box. In bluebirds, the number of larvae per nest was significantly correlated with nest material volume in 1989 and number of fledglings in 1990. In tree swallows, the number of larvae per nest was significantly correlated with hatching date and number of fledglings in 1989. Information on reproduction in Protocalliphora was obtained. Gravid flies were captured in active nests up to the last end of the second week of the nestling period. P. sialia was determined to be at last bivoltine through mark, release, and recapture studies. It was determine that nulliparous P. sialia can complete egg development within 9 or 10 days after eclosion. The practicality of a new Protocalliphora trapping technique and a mark, release, and recapture technique was demonstrated.

The Gomori inclusions emit an orange-red autofluorescence, consistent with porphyrin and stain with diaminobenzidine, indicative of peroxidase activity. Although the orange-red autofluorescence is suggestive of porphyrins, it has not been shown that porphyrins concentrate in Gomori inclusions. The present study shows that a radioactively labeled porphyrin precursor does localize to Gomori inclusions. The peroxidase activity is thought to result from redox active transition metals in the inclusions. This study addresses transition metal content of the inclusions. Using radioautography, it was determined that Gomori inclusions sequester and concentrate chromium. Additionally, energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis shows that nascent Gomori inclusions sequester iron, but that this is eventually replaced by copper. The results of this study elucidate the developmental trajectory of Gomori inclusions and provide a basis for understanding their role in neuropathology.</description><creator>Small, Lorne N.

Organizations have used this type of progress behavior in making managerial decisions regarding cost estimating and budgeting, production and labor scheduling, product pricing, etc. This progress was studied in productivity, product-quality and personal skills, in an experiment involving a sample of 12 subjects, who completed one project every week for ten weeks. Second-order training was provided to the subjects through the Personal Software Process, PSP, of Humphrey. A within-subject repeated measure time-series quasi-experimental design was used along with a modified G/Q/M method. It was found that on average, progress takes place at a rate of 20%, with the second-order training adding up to 13% more improvement in addition to the first-order learning. Detailed statistical methods were used to produce linear and log-linear models of high correlations, involving four variables: productivity, defect-rate, complexity and cumulative output. The motivation of the subjects did not change significantly during the experiment. It was also found that the McCabe's and Halstead's complexity metrics had a correlation of 0.80 amongst each other. However, no relationship could be found between the personal capabilities of the individuals and the progress rate.</description><creator>Sherdil, Khalid</creator><contributor>Madhavji, Nazim (advisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Education, Technology.</subject><subject>Psychology, Industrial.</subject><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Personal "progress functions" in the software process</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0z708z97x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/np193c030</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ws859h70b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:07:34Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Available evidence from RCTs shows that GPs' counselling can be effective in reducing smoking prevalence and that some specific features of the intervention (for example the offer of follow-up visits) may enhance its effectiveness. The impact of such preventive activity, however, is dependent not only on intervention characteristics, but also on factors related to the recipients (smokers) and the providers (physicians). Paper 1 explores the role of pre-treatment factors in predicting quitting following GPs' counselling among 861 smokers enrolled in the Turin smoking cessation trial. Social support and smoke free environment reinforce the impact of GPs' counselling, which is less effective for more addicted smokers and for women. Counselling might be more effective, if GPs would take advantage of information on individuals' experience of behavioral change to tailor their message. Paper 2 compares a group of smokers (N = 965), who were invited to participate in the Turin smoking 1 cessation trial, to a matched sample of smokers (N = 277), listed in the files of 42 GPs collaborating in the trial. The patients in the second set were potentially eligible for recruitment, but were not invited to participate. Estimates of the effect of individual characteristics on patient recruitment indicate that GPs focused their efforts on heavier and diseased smokers. As this tendency may dilute the impact of their anti-smoking action, more effective educational strategies should be implemented when planning preventive interventions.</description><creator>Senore, Carlo</creator><contributor>Battista, Renaldo N.

Tidal analysis of tide gauge data and predicted tides shows a phase advance and amplitude decrease of the tide under continuous landfast sea ice. Current meter and echosounder measurements, as well as temperature-salinity profiles were taken within the first 2 km off-shore of the river mouth to provide a detailed picture of the nearshore plume conditions. Stable, subcritical flow conditions were observed for most of the sampling period, with the buoyant freshwater plume maintaining a depth of about 4 m almost continuously. During spring low tide (the lowest low tide), the cross-sectional area through which the river discharge must flow decreases substantially, resulting in supercritical (Froude number $&gt;$1) conditions over some periods and the formation of an internal hydraulic jump.</description><creator>Seifert, Konstanze H.</creator><contributor>Ingram, Grant (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Physical Oceanography.</subject><subject>Hydrology.</subject><title>Nearshore characteristics of an under-ice river plume</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bv73c2642.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vd66w183k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7s75df620</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:07:35Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We present a technique to organize gauge invariant sums of tree level Feynman diagrams into string-like and suggestively gauge invariant expressions.

Magnetic susceptibility, upper critical field, and superconducting transition temperature were measured for as-made and relaxed Zr-rich compositions. The results showed an unusual increase in superconducting transition temperature upon thermal annealing which was not observed previously in any other metallic glass systems. This phenomenon is due to the presence of spin fluctuations in Fe-Zr glasses. Upon structural relaxation the decrease in the electron-phonon coupling constant, $ lambda sb{ rm ep},$ leads to a decrease in T$ sb{ rm c}$ for all superconducting metallic glasses. However, it is shown that when spin fluctuations are present, the decrease in spin fluctuations mass enhancement parameter, $ lambda sb{ rm sf},$ upon relaxation is responsible for the overall enhancement in T$ sb{ rm c}$. A theoretical basis for this T$ sb{ rm c}$ enhancement is provided by analyzing the experimental data using the modified form of the McMillan equation and the Ginsburg-Landau-Gor'kov expression for the upper critical field together with the expression for the Stoner enhanced magnetic susceptibility.</description><creator>Sabouri-Ghomi, Mohsen</creator><contributor>Altounian, Zaven (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Physics, Condensed Matter.</subject><subject>Engineering, Materials Science.</subject><title>Enhancement of superconductivity in relaxed Fe-Zr metallic glasses</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c247dv23f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rw599</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fq977x08s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:07:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study was designed to compare the behavioral pain responses of 2-month-old Canadian-born Chinese babies receiving a routine immunization to those of Caucasian infants in similar situations. Two groups of 26 infants were obtained through convenience from a pediatric clinic held by a Chinese pediatrician at the Chinese Hospital and a suburban pediatric practice of a large Canadian city. Facial expression using the Neonatal Facial Coding System (Grunau &amp; Craig, 1987) and cry using the Fast Fourier Transform were measured during 30 seconds following the insertion of the needle. Acculturation in Chinese mothers, infant temperament, circadian rhythm, were assessed. Multivariate analysis of variance revealed significant differences in pain response between these two groups with the Chinese babies showing greater response. No significant effect of temperament, circadian rhythm, and gender was identified. This supports the presence of differences in pain response in relation to culture/race by at least 2 months of age.</description><creator>Rosmus, Christina</creator><contributor>Johnston, C.

Four storage level scenarios were considered. The first involved a zero-supply security scenario, where the model was required to simply satisfy the demand in each period. The second, third and fourth respectively, involved two, three and four months supply security scenarios, where the model was required to purchase grain equivalent to the demand for those periods. Scenario two, providing two months supply security was not discussed because it posted results similar to scenario one. The hypothesis that a stocks management model can be developed to be used by the NCPB in order to determine the optimal quantities of maize that it handles every year, while minimizing costs, was partly supported under scenarios one and three. However, despite the reduction in costs under scenario one, the lack of inventory and foreign trade was seen to increase the risks and uncertainties associated with variations in production, especially under cases of short supply. Similarly, the lack of foreign trade under scenario three was postulated to increase risks and uncertainties in periods of low production. Under scenario four, the results involved foreign trade, and inventory was positive for most years. However, these results were suboptimal and thus unreliable for policy decisions. Nevertheless, results under this scenario were very similar to the actual performance of NCPB for the period 1980 to 1990. The results of this study show that external trade may not be the solution to a strategy of cost minimization. It was concluded, therefore, that the present strategy of self-sufficiency may be the better alternative.

The free amino group, available after methylamine deprotection of the phthalimide linker, was protected with the levulinyl protecting group (e.g., 20). Branched 'Y'-shaped nucleic acids containing branching monomer 20 were synthesized using standard solid phase synthetic methodology and complexes of these branched nucleic acids with one and two mole-equivalents of linear complement dA$ sb{10}$ are investigated by thermal melting. At the branching point the levulinic amide exhibited poor lability to Letsinger's hydrazine solution and proved to be incompatible with the solid phase synthesis of branched nucleic acids. The primary amino group provided a handle which was used to extend the size of the linker incorporating a primary hydroxyl group at the site of levulinic protection (e.g., 37, 38). The levulinic ester showed much better lability to hydrazinolysis rendering it more compatible with the solid phase synthesis of branched nucleic acids.

Two stations located on Lake St. Francis were selected for establishing a time-curve for the accumulation of organochlorine pesticides (OC) and PCB in the liver. The ducks rapidly lost weight during their first 20 days in the natural environment but stabilised after about 40 days. This weight loss was caused by the stress of habitat, change, the energetic costs in searching for food and moulting. There was a rapid increase in the number and concentration of contaminants detected in the livers of ducks exposed to pollutants in the natural environment. The concentrations found were low (99.9% of OC-PCB are under 1 mg/kg wet weight basis). These individuals were generally from 10 to 1000 times more contaminated than the control ducks for 40 days of exposure. The use of domestic ducks as bioindicators has several advantages. They can be obtained readily and cheaply, and the sex and age of the individuals can be controlled. Since they are not very mobile and therefore are easy to locate, they provide information on the contamination (metals or OC-PCB) of specific sites. The use of Peking ducks has some limitations. There is a need for appropriate habitats to ensure their survival, and there is considerable stress caused by transferring the ducks from the breeding farm to the natural environment, thereby obliging them to search for food and exposing them to predators and poachers.

In the tumor, 87% of the acidic joining peptide (AJP) is found as a dimer rather than as a monomer, the prevalent form found in normal pituitary tissue. The corticotropin (ACTH) purified and characterized from the tumor was found not to be phosphorylated. In contrast, human ACTH of normal pituitary origin is found to be 30% phosphorylated at the serine residue at position 31. No evidence of cleavage at residues 49-50 to produce $ tau sb3$-MSH and the 1-49 fragment was found. ACTH was purified from extracts of guinea-pig anterior pituitaries and characterized in terms of its amino acid composition and molecular weight using IS-MS and HPLC. Guinea-pig ACTH was found to have a similar activity to that of human ACTH with respect to the maximal steroid output of corticosterone and aldosterone. However, it proved to be slightly more potent in terms of the concentration which elicited half-maximal steroid secretion. Under the assay conditions used, guinea-pig ACTH does not seem to a superagonist as suggested by a previous study. Combining amino acid compositions, mass spectrometric data, and the recent determination of the cDNA sequence for guinea-pig ACTH, the identification of various purified biosynthetic derivatives of guinea-pig POMC was facilitated. Joining peptide, a major product of POMC processing, was found in extracts of both anterior and neurointermediate lobes. The purified peptide corresponded exactly in amino acid composition and mass to the predicted structure established by the CDNA sequence. Also, by using ion-spray mass spectrometry, post-translational modifications of other products of intermediate lobe processing were observed. N- and O-acetylation of $ alpha$-melanotrophin, partial O-phosphorylation of corticotrophin-like intermediate lobe peptide and carboxyl-terminal amidation of $ beta$-melanotrophin were identified.

Merill) rotations (C-S-C and S-C-S), continuous corn (C-C-C) and continuous soybean (S-S-S) systems on optimum N fertilization rates, yield and soil residual N levels. Field experiments were carried out on a Ste. Rosalie clay (Humic Gleysol) and an Ormstown silty clay loam (Humic Gleysol). Overall, tillage had little effect on soil and crop N levels or grain yields. Residual soil NO$ sb3$-N in the fall was related to fertilizer N rates in C-C-C, but not with S-S-S or soybean in rotation. Residual NO$ sb3$-N values after soybean were high and at zero added N were equivalent to 90 kg N with C-C-C. Consequently, soybean contributed the equivalent of 90 kg N ha$ sp{-1}$ to subsequent corn.

Both genes are thought to act as tumour suppressors with inactivation of both alleles resulting in abnormal cell growth. By inference from other hereditary cancer syndromes, it has been hypothesized that somatic mutation at the NF1 and NF2 loci is involved in the development of sporadic tumors of the types found with increased prevalence in these disorders. In addition to other malignancies, individuals with NF1 are at an increased risk to develop astrocytomas and rhabdomyosarcomas. We have therefore screened 34 astrocytomas for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) using three NF1-derived cDNA probes, and have found no abnormalities. Half of NF2 patients develop spinal and cranial meningiomas, while fully 90% develop bilateral vestibular schwannomas. In addition, loss of heterozygosity (LDH) of chromosome 22 markers is known to occur in malignant melanona and breast cancer. To evaluate the role of NF2 in sporadic cancer, single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP) was carried out on all 17 exons of the NF2 gene. 57 variants have been found, 44 in meningiomas, 12 in schwannomas, and a single variant in a melanoma. Most of these represent inactivating mutations (frameshift, splice-site, and nonsense), as determined by direct sequencing. Since the majority of these changes occur in tumours previously shown to have LOH at chromosome 22 markers flanking NF2, our results support a tumour suppressor role for this gene in meningiomas. In addition, given that 40% of our tumours do not show LOH over this region, we propose that at least one other gene is involved in the development of this latter subset of meningiomas.

The Cut proteins define a distinct class of homeodomain proteins with multiple DNA binding domains. In this project I investigated Cut mRNA expression in adult mouse tissues, using RNase and S1 nuclease mapping. Cut mRNA was found to be widely expressed in both adult mouse tissues and cultured cells. Actinomycin chase experiments indicated that Cut mRNAs have a short half-life. In addition to the Cut mRNA found in normal cells, another Cut mRNA species was detected in some tumor cell lines, including HOS (human osteosarcoma), RAJI and RAMOS (Burkitts lymphomas). These transcripts diverged in the region immediately after the Cut homeobox and were generated as a result of an alternative splicing or polyadenylation event. In this study I also cloned and characterized the murine Cut cDNA (mCut). Sequence comparison with the hCut revealed a high degree of homology especially within evolutionary conserved domains. However, there were two regions of sequence divergence, one between Cut repeat I and Cut repeat II and the other just downstream of the homeodomain. Domain swapping experiments revealed that the carboxyl terminal regions of both mCut and hCut function as active repression domains. Interestingly, the fusion protein containing mCut which diverges from hCut in a portion of this carboxyl terminal region acts as a much stronger repressor of transcription.</description><creator>Phillips, Sherlyn Louise</creator><contributor>Nepueu, A.

An improved method for the mass screening of a vast collection of fungi was developed for this purpose. Some of the previously reported criteria such as leaf rheology and overwintering structure production proved unreliable or fastidious and cannot be used for in vitro antagonist selection. The main antagonism selection criterium retained was the in vitro inhibition of ascospore formation. To measure ascospore production, a simplified method of in vitro pseudothecia production was devised. This new method eliminates the need for prior conidia production by using a mycelial suspension and greatly reduces the risks of sterile mating by using a cocktail of Venturia inaequalis strains of different origins. Finally, the production cycle duration was reduced by varying the incubation temperature during the simulated winter. Moreover, a quick and efficient method of ascospore collection was developed. Ascospores were forcibly ejected in a large scale bubbler type apparatus in only one hour. This bubbler can be used for other studies including axenically produced ascospores. This new method compared favourably to the previously reported method and was used to screen a collection of about forty-two fungi. Six proved to significantly reduce the ascospore production of Venturia inaequalis. Two were as effective as Athelia bombacina, a previously reported antagonist of pseudothecia formation and inhibited over 98% of the ascospore production. These new organisms are now available for future field tests. Future selections from a large collection of saprophytes can now be based on a reliable and simple in vitro screening methodology.</description><creator>Philion, Vincent</creator><contributor>Paulitz, Timothy (advisor)</contributor><contributor>Carisse, Odile (advisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Venturia inaequalis -- Biological control.</subject><subject>Apples -- Diseases and pests -- Biological control.</subject><subject>Apple scab.</subject><title>The screening of potential fungal antagonists of pseudothecial formation by the apple scab pathogen : Venturia inaequalis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b2773x717.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ft848s602</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Plant Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ws859h71m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:07:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is a study of narratives by eighteen children 10 to 13 years old who live in an Algonquin community of Quebec. The narratives, primarily of children's personal experiences, were collected in peer groups, and were told in English, the children's second language. The specific contributions of children to each other's narratives were investigated and are described. The structural properties of a subset of the narratives were also examined using high point analysis (Peterson &amp; McCabe, 1983). Findings resembled those reported for non-Aboriginal children with respect to the inclusion of the narrative elements of orientation, actions, and evaluation. However, the positioning of these elements and the low incidence of others resulted in differences in the structure of the narratives. Other aspects of the narratives considered include theme, narrator role, and the use of reported speech. The characteristics of the narratives are discussed as means by which the children in the study constructed and co-constructed narrative meaning. Information on the functional dimensions of narratives in the community and on the sociocultural context in which the children live is also provided in order to facilitate the reader's appreciation of factors that influence children's narrative production.</description><creator>Pesco, Diane</creator><contributor>Crago, M.

Using DNA fingerprinting we show that none of 108 nestlings samples were the result of egg dumping. In contrast, 40% of nestlings were the result of extra-pair fertilizations. Males sired a greater proportion of their broods as they aged. In addition, promiscuous females were never fertilized by males that were younger than their social mates. Whether the poor reproductive performance of younger males was caused by female preference for older males or by intra-sexual competition was not determined. In any case, females would have benefited by mating with older males, if the traits that allowed the survival of the father were inherited by the females' offspring. Only three of 80 males attracted two females through polyterritoriality. One male fledged two broods: he sired both nestlings from his first brood, but none of the four nestlings from his second brood. We concluded that male redstarts can improve their reproductive success by trying to obtain extra-pair copulations, but less so by establishing a second territory.</description><creator>Perreault, Stéphane, 1967-</creator><contributor>Lemon, Robert E.
