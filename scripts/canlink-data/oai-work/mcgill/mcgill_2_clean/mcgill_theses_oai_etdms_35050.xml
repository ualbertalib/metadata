Of the available-selective sulfur methodologies, flame photometric detector coupled to gas chromatography is the most widely used. It has proven to be a sensitive and selective method for detection of heat stable and volatile sulfur compounds. Fundamentally, this technique is not applicable to high boiling and/or thermolabile sulfur compounds. More recently, hyphenated flame photometric detector has been utilized, with limited success, to monitor sulfur species in liquid chromatography. However, existing HPLC-FPD methodologies have never been applied to real samples, due to the low population of S 2, the emitting species, and the quenching effects of the other species present in the flame. In this work, two total consumption high-performance liquid chromatography flame photometric (HPLC-FPD) interfaces compatible with either methanolic or aqueous mobile phases are described and optimized for monitoring low volatile and thermally fragile sulfur compounds in biological samples. Each interface was fuelled either by methanol or by hydrogen. The all quartz interfaces enclosed four consecutive thermal processes: (a) thermovaporization of the HPLC effluent; (b) pyrolysis of the organic matrix (including sulfur species) in a kinetic H2/O2 flame; (c) conversion of the oxidized sulfur compounds to H2S in a reducing post-combustion stage fuelled by hydrogen; and (d) transport of the generated hydrides towards a hydrogen radical rich surrounding of an inverted hydrogen-oxygen diffusion flame. Chemiluminescence induced in the last step was integrated as a narrow beam in a light-guide positioned remotely from the analytical cool flame and oriented towards a photomultiplier unit. Radioisotopic assays demonstrated that sulfur (as H235SO4) was transferred quantitatively to the analytical flame. Indirect evidence suggested that sulfur was hydrogenated in the post-combustion step via a thermochemical hydride generation process to mediate the formation of S2. The linearity of calibration graphs (0.9950 &lt; r &lt; 0.9986), where r is the correlation coefficient) and unprecedented HPLC-FPD limits of detection for sulfur compounds (1.5 etag/s for 2-methylthiophene, 2.25 etag/s for carbon disulfide, and 4.5 etag/s for ethanesulfonic acid) allowed for the speciation of sulfur species in garlic extracts. Alternatively, modification of the methanol fuelled interface to a hydrogen fuelled reactor allowed detection of thiosulfinates and high molecular weight sulfur compounds in horse kidney and garlic extracts, respectively.</description><creator>Bernard, JoÃ«l.</creator><contributor>Jean-Simom, Blais (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Taurine.</subject><subject>High performance liquid chromatography.</subject><subject>Sulfur compounds.</subject><subject>Garlic -- Analysis.</subject><title>Design and characterization of a thermochemical high performance liquid chromatography flame photometric detector for the detection of non-volatile andor thermolabile sulfur compounds</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bg257g72j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n296x0740</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gx41mk65b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:49:35Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Stress stimulates dopamine (DA) transmission in nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) and it is thought that NAcc and PFC play an role in behavioural responses to stress. Behavioural responses to stress can increase with each subsequent exposure and this sensitization process involves enhanced DA transmission in NAcc. However, individual differences in the rate of sensitization suggest that predisposing variables contribute to this process. We examined whether early life events, particularly perinatal anoxia, influence adult NAcc and PFC DA function and alter predisposition to the sensitizing effects of repeated stress. We subjected rats to a period of intra-uterine anoxia following Caesarean (C)-section birth (C+15) or C-section only (C+0), and later examined the adult DA response to repeated stress in these animals in comparison to vaginally-born (VAG) rats. It was found that NAcc DA transmission in rats born via C-section, with or without additional anoxia, will sensitize more readily to repeated mild stress than VAG animals. Furthermore, C+15 animals will sensitize more readily to the acute behavioural effects of amphetamine following repeated mild stress. Considering that PFC DA function is thought to be lateralized and PFC DA release tonically inhibits NAcc DA transmission, we examined the DA stress response in the left and right PFC of these groups. C+15 rats exhibited attenuated stress-elicited DA transmission in the right, but not left, PFC and showed increased right PFC DA transporter binding. We then turned to identifying brain structures that might mediate anoxia-induced changes in DA and DA-related behaviours. In separate experiments, the effects of neonatal exitotoxic lesions to PFC and hippocampus on the NAcc DA stress response were studied. Rats with ventral hippocampal lesions displayed an attenuated NAcc DA stress response whereas rats with PFC lesions expressed an elevated NAcc DA stress response. These studies demonstrate that birth complications lead to increased stress-induced responsivity of mesolimbic DA transmission. They are also suggestive that this effect is mediated by developmental abberations of PFC which can lead to decreased tonic inhibition of NAcc DA release.</description><creator>Brake, Wayne Gerard.</creator><contributor>Gratton, Alain (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Influence of perinatal and early postnatal insults on the adult dopamine stress response in rats</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sx61dp068.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gx41mk65b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n009w4074</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:49:35Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Nerve growth factor (NGF) belongs to the neurotrophin family of growth factors. NGF can bind to two transmembrane receptors, TrkA and p75. TrkA is the NGF specific tyrosine kinase receptor; p75 is a receptor which is common to all neurotrophins. NGF is required for the development, maintenance and repair of the nervous system. NGF dependent neuronal populations are affected in many diseases and the use of NGF was proposed. Difficulties associated with therapeutic application of proteins and polypeptides could be overcome by the use of small peptidomimetics. Small molecule that can either mimic or inhibit NGF-TrkA signaling could be useful in therapy of a wide range of pathologies from neurodegeneration to cancer. Peptide mimetics represent an intermediate step towards the development of potent drugs. Small NGF mimetics could be found either in random peptide libraries or by rational drug design. Rational design is based on structure-function knowledge about the binding interface. We approach the problem by designing a series of cyclic peptides from the C-D loop of NGF that is known to interact with TrkA receptor. Nuclear Magnetic Resonace (NMR) was used to determine the structure and dynamics of the peptides in solution. The structural information was combined with bioactivity tests. Comparison of the structures revealed close similarity between the peptides and the conformation of the C-D loop in X-ray crystal structures of NGF. Structural similarity ensures an appropriate backbone conformation and orientation of the sidechains involved in interactions with receptor. This work contributes to our understanding of the structure-function relationships in NGF-TrkA binding. The designed bioactive peptides could serve as a template for further design of smaller peptidomimetics of NGF with improved potency and stability. A similar approach could be used to design functional mimetics of the other neurotrophins.</description><creator>Beglova, Natalia, 1962-</creator><contributor>Gehriuf, D.

The first route proceeds by the generation of an N-allyl substituted amino ester, its coupling to a second amino acid and subsequent oxidative cleavage of the carbon-carbon double bond to provide the cyclized product. The second route proceeds by the generation of 4-nitrobenzenesulfonamide dipeptides and their alkylation by 1,2-dibromoethane. The third route proceeds by a Mitsunobu reaction between sulfonamide dipeptides and bromoethanol followed by treatment with DBU to generate the desired 2-oxopiperazine derivative. The fourth route again uses the sulfonamide dipeptide esters as intermediates. This time an allyl group is installed and this is then converted to the diol that is subsequently oxidatively cleaved by action of sodium periodate. Alternatively, the allyl group is converted to the epoxide that is treated with periodic acid to effectively carry out the same transformation. The synthesis of these ethylene-bridged dipeptides was also carried out on solid support in an effort to create a combinatorial library of such constrained peptidomimetics. The partial success of the above-mentioned approaches on solid support is described. Finally, the synthesis of two new analogs of Thyrotropin Releasing Hormone (TRH) incorporating the 2-oxopiperazine ring is described.</description><creator>Bhatt, Ulhas.</creator><contributor>Just, George (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Chemistry, Organic.</subject><title>Functionalized 2-oxopiperazines from amino acids</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fb494b16f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d161n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:b8515q03k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:49:36Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Small groups of circular cylinders of equal diameter, in tandem, side-by-side and staggered configurations, were investigated in steady mean cross-flow, and under conditions of an impulsive start, for Reynolds numbers from 500 to 6000. Experiments were conducted in water in three facilities, using flow visualization, hot-film anemometry and particle image velocimetry (PIV). The emphasis was on acquiring an improved physical understanding of the fluid behaviour, and the dynamics of the vortical structures in the flow, as the number of cylinders, the spacing between the cylinders, and the angle of incidence with respect to the oncoming flow, were varied. For tandem cylinders in impulsively started flow, the development showed constrained streamwise growth and lateral expansion of the gap recirculation zones at small and intermediate pitch ratios. Under steady cross-flow conditions, reattachment of the free shear layers from the upstream cylinder, onto the surface of the downstream cylinder, was found to occur in an alternating, non-continuous, and non-simultaneous fashion, in a process synchronized with Karman vortex shedding from the downstream cylinder. Within the gap between the cylinders, bounded on either side by the reattaching shear layers, was found weakly rotating or stagnant fluid, with vorticity concentrations only near the points of reattachment. The temporal development of the side-by-side configuration was dominated by strong flow through the gaps between the cylinders, rapid breakup of the recirculation zones behind the outer cylinders, gap vortex shedding, and the formation of a counter-rotating vortex pair in the combined wake. Under steady mean cross-flow conditions, the PIV vorticity data showed instantaneous variation in the base-bleed flows, the gap flow deflection angles and the vortex formation lengths. In the three-cylinder side-by-side configuration, vortex shedding frequency measurements were sensitive to the measurement location. For the two-cylinder staggered configuration in steady cross-flow, nine flow patterns were identified, and processes of vortex pairing, enveloping, impingement and induced separation were observed. Some new insight was gained into previously published force coefficient and Strouhal number data, by considering the flow patterns responsible. The study revealed that vortex shedding frequencies are more properly associated with the individual shear layers, rather than with the individual cylinders.</description><creator>Sumner, David, 1969-</creator><contributor>Price, S.

This thesis examines in detail wh-questions and negative polarity items in Japanese and English in an effort to pin down a number of issues related to this question. Chapter one introduces some of the basic notions of current syntactic theory within which the discussion in this thesis takes place. The chapter also contains basic syntactic properties of wh-questions and negative polarity items in English and Japanese. Chapter two advances a cooccurence restriction condition on wh-questions and negative polarity items. The condition to be introduced is referred to as the Linear Crossing Constraint (LCC). Assuming with Saito (1992) that scrambling can be undone at the level of logical form, it is argued that the LCC applies to the surface form of a sentence. Various consequences that follow from the LCC are also discussed. Chapter three argues that wh-phrases and negative polarity items undergo movement in the logical form component of grammar. The discussion in this chapter is dependent on the scope facts involving these grammatical constructions. Chapter four is concerned with the Subjacency Condition. Nishigauchi (1992) proposes that movement in the logical form component is constrained by the Subjacency Condition in much the same way as movement is in the overt component. It is shown that the relevant sentences pointed out by Nishigauchi should be accounted for by a condition on logical form representations. Chapter five deals with why certain instances of scrambling can be undone in the logical form component but others cannot, as observed by Takahashi (1993). The aim of Chapter six is to develop an account of the distribution of adjunct wh-phrases, such as why and naze. It is pointed out that naze shares a number of characteristics in common with negative polarity items and floating quantifiers. I argue that there is only one specifier position per functional head. Chapter Seven extends the theory developed in Chapter six to another set of data. It is argued that the distribution of floating quantifiers can naturally be captured under the proposed theory. The final chapter concludes this thesis by pointing out some consequences of this theory.</description><creator>Tanaka, Hidekazu.</creator><contributor>Baker, Mark (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Grammar, Comparative and general -- Syntax.</subject><subject>Grammar, Comparative and general -- Interrogative.</subject><title>Conditions on logical form derivations and representations</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pk02cc57f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n583xw72h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Linguistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:js956h589</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:49:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Rockbursts may cause damages to underground openings and to equipment, and constitute a major hazard to the safety of mine workers. One method that can be used to evaluate if there is a rockburst potential is to compare the stiffness of the failed rock with that of the surrounding rock mass. This method has been applied successfully in the past to rockbursts involving fracturing of the rock mass. This thesis deals with the development of a similar approach for rockbursts involving a violent slip along major geological discontinuities. To evaluate the post-peak shear stiffness of a discontinuity, a new non-linear constitutive model for rock joint was developed. This model is based on two exponential formulations expressing the two phenomena taking part in the shearing process: friction resistance along surfaces and shearing of asperities. Compared with test results, the model showed a correlation factor (R2) of 0.90. The model was then implemented in an existing boundary element code to evaluate the interaction between underground openings and nearby geological discontinuities. Verification of the implementation was done by reproducing direct shear tests on a discontinuity. Parametric analyses were performed on the new model that highlighted the most important parameters. Methods to obtain the different stiffnesses involved in the violent slip process were developed. Examples of applications were given to illustrate the proposed methods. Finally, an alternative method to evaluate the fault-slip rockburst potential was developed. This new method relies on a linear analysis and the calculation of a new index called the Out-of-Balance Index or OBI. The OBI showed some agreement with the stiffness approach.</description><creator>Simon, Richard, 1967-</creator><contributor>Mitri, Hani S.

This dissertation argues that representations of the household in the comedies are best understood as theatrical explorations of ethical inquiry as it pertains to everyday lived experience. Using contemporary sermons, political tracts, and conduct books to situate Shakespeare's plays within a larger cultural movement that was coming to understand the household as a foundation of the moral economy of early modern England, this study provides readings of The Comedy of Errors, The Merry Wives of Windsor, and The Tempest that emphasize each play's investigation of the household as a potential locus of the good life. The characters in these plays develop an awareness of themselves as members of broader communities by negotiating the particular details of household existence---by sharing meals, exchanging gifts, and falling in love. This awareness is in turn presented as a necessary component of personal happiness and a fundamental constituent of a just and merciful state. By developing an account of household life in the plays, this dissertation argues that recognizing the importance of affective domestic relations to constructions of the self as socially embedded moral agent is crucial to understanding the comedies' nuanced analysis of gender, class, and race relations.</description><creator>Slights, Jessica.</creator><contributor>Bristol, Michael D.

Optimal foraging models predict that predators should select and exploit the most profitable prey types and reject unprofitable ones. The goal of this research was to evaluate the mechanisms underlying prey selection, prey exploitation and predation efficacy in the generalist predator Coleomegilla maculata lengi Timb. (Col., Coccinellidae). The influence of prey species, prey size and predator age on predation efficacy and prey consumption by C. maculata was determined using non-choice laboratory tests. The three lepidopterous species occurring in cruciferous crops, namely, Artogeia rapae (L.), Plutella xylostella (L.) and Trichoplusia ni (Hubner), were used as prey. Results showed that, within a given prey instar, C. maculata preyed more on P. xylostella than on the other two species and that predation efficacy increased with increasing predator age. These experiments also revealed that coccinellid larvae had a higher prey weight consumption rate on intermediate-sized prey compared to smaller or larger prey even though they killed a higher number of small prey. It is suggested that this higher efficacy on prey of intermediate size could be a consequence of higher costs associated with the consumption of prey at both ends of the size spectrum. To evaluate behavioral parameters of prey selection in C. maculata larvae, an image analysis system, initially developed for parasitoids searching for hosts, was modified. This system was programmed to locate the eggs used as prey and to detect and follow the movements of the C. maculata larval head. This user-friendly system can detect and follow the movements with less than 0.1% of error. Using this tracking system, the discriminatory capacity and the prey selection behavior of C. maculata larvae were evaluated in choice situations in which prey differed in quality (unparasitized, parasitized, young or old T. ni eggs). Coccinellid larvae did not exhibit any preference between parasitized and unparasitized eggs of the same physiological age. However, when physiological age differed, coccinellid larvae always preferred the younger eggs despite parasitism. Longer handling time and detrimental effects on immature developmental time and survival was always observed on the less preferred egg type. This study also revealed that coccinellid larvae can learn to gradually reject the less suitable parasitized eggs, thereby improving their prey selection behavior. It was also demonstrated that these learned behaviors could be forgotten and that previous experiences on other prey types could influence the initial preference of coccinellid larvae. This study clearly indicates that the generalist predator C. maculata can select and exploit prey according to their profitability by using discrimination and learning abilities.</description><creator>Roger, Caroline.</creator><contributor>Boivin, Guy (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Coderne, Daniel (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Ladybugs -- Food.</subject><subject>Predation (Biology)</subject><title>Mechanisms of prey selection in the ladybeetle Coleomegilla maculata Lengi Timb.

All that remain of the novel are a few manuscripts totalling some thousand pages conserved in her personal archives at the National Library of Canada. The manuscripts contain several versions of a story based on an episode taken from the history of the maternal side of Roy's family: the family's migration from Quebec to Manitoba at the end of the XIXth century. It revolves around Eveline, a character who already appears in the published works and who was essentially inspired by the author's mother, Melina Landry. This novel not only adds a new episode to the fictionalized story of the family, it reveals lesser known aspects of Gabrielle Roy's writing and thinking, notably her thoughts on the feminine condition. This thesis consists of a critical edition of two of the six versions we have identified. A fairly complete story, which includes the latest and the most perfected texts, is thus obtained. The text is annotated and accompanied by a section entitled "Reecritures et notes critiques" [Rewritings and critical notes]. A three-part essay presenting the novel ("Presentation de La Saga d' Eveline") precedes it. In the first part, "Situation de La Saga d'Eveline", after giving a general outline of the projected work, we discuss problems in dating raised by the manuscripts, establish links between La Saga d' Eveline and the published works, and suggest a few possible areas of further research. The next part, "Les manuscrits de La Saga d'Eveline", includes a presentation of the material as well as the textual aspects of the manuscripts, some hypotheses regarding dates, a proposal on how the manuscripts should be classified and a discussion of the unfinished character of the work.

The prevalence of GDM using the National Diabetes Data Group criteria among the Cree was 12.8% (95% CI: 10.1--15.5), among the highest ever reported for an Aboriginal group. Independent risk factors for GDM among the Cree were advanced age, pregravid overweight and previous GDM. A comparison of risk of GDM between Cree and non-Native women revealed a significant interaction between ethnicity and pregravid weight. Overweight Cree women were at an elevated risk for GDM compared with overweight non-Native women (OR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.3--3.8), whereas the risk for GDM was not statistically different between normal weight Cree and non-Native women (OR: 1.4, 95% CI: 0.7--2.7) after adjusting for age, parity, and smoking status. Mean birth weight among Cree infants was 3859 +/- 519 g, the highest reported for any ethnic group in the world. Macrosomia prevalence was also high at 34.3%. Independent risk factors for macrosomia among the Cree were advanced age, pregravid overweight and GDM. A significant interaction was noted between ethnicity and GDM on risk for macrosomia. GDM increased the risk for macrosomia 4.5-fold among the Cree but had no significant effect among non-Natives. After adjusting for age, parity, pregravid weight, gestational weight gain, GDM, gestational duration and smoking status, Cree infants remained heavier than non-Native infants by 235 g. The results of this research indicate the need to control pregravid obesity through culturally acceptable dietary modifications and exercise in order to minimize the risk for GDM among Cree women. The significant impact of GDM on risk for macrosomia among the Cree calls for the re-evaluation of the existi</description><creator>Rodrigues, Shaila.</creator><contributor>Gray-Donald, Katherine (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Diabetes in pregnancy -- James Bay Region -- Epidemiology.</subject><subject>Fetal Macrosomia -- Quebec.</subject><subject>Birth weight -- James Bay Region.</subject><subject>Cree Indians -- James Bay Region.</subject><title>Epidemiology of gestational diabetes mellitus and infant macrosomia among the Cree of James Bay</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/79407z90f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q237ht47k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z029p642m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:49:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Cross-linguistically, the notion 'minimal word' has proved fruitful grounds for explanatory accounts of requirements imposed on morphological and phonological constituents. Word minimality requires that a lexical word includes the main-stressed foot of the language. As a result, subminimal words are augmented to a bimoraic foot through diverse strategies like vowel lengthening, syllable addition, etc. Even languages with numerous monomoraic lexical words may impose a minimality requirement on derived words that would otherwise be smaller than a well-formed foot. In addition, the minimal word has been argued to play a central role in characterizing a prosodic base within some morpho-prosodic constituent for the application of processes such as reduplication and infixation. The goal of this thesis is to offer an explanation as to why and in which contexts grammars may prefer a prosodic constituent which may not be reducible to a bimoraic foot. I provide explanatory accounts for a number of cases where the prosodic structure of morphological or phonological constituents cannot be defined as coextensive with the main stressed foot of the language. To this end, I propose to add to the theory of Prosodic Structure (Chen 1987; Selkirk 1984, 1986, 1989, 1995; Selkirk and Shen 1990) within an optimality-theoretic framework by providing evidence for a new level within the Prosodic Hierarchy, that of the Prosodic Stem (PrStem). An important aspect of the model of prosodic structure proposed here is a notion of headship which follows directly from the Prosodic Hierarchy itself and from the metrical grouping of prosodic constituents. A theory of prosodic heads is developed which assumes that structural constraints can impose well-formedness requirements on the prosodic shape and the distribution of heads within morphological and phonological constituents.</description><creator>Rodier, Dominique.</creator><contributor>Piggott, Glyne L.

Replacement dolomite occurs in Leduc buildups and their underlying platforms, whereas Swan Hills and Wabamun dolomites are generally limited to narrow N-NW trends. These N-NW dolomite trends in the Swan Hills Formation are associated with the platform reef area while in the Wabamun Formation they occur above the edges of Leduc buildups. Pervasive replacement dolomite has light delta18O values (-9.7 to -3.6â° PDB), and Sr isotopes slightly more radiogenic (87Sr/ 86Sr = 0.7083 to 0.7118) than Devonian seawater values. Temperatures of dolomite formation of 50Â°C to 75Â°C from slightly modified brines during shallow to intermediate burial (800--1500 m) in the Devonian to Mississippian is suggested by the isotopic data. The Leduc (possibly Cambrian and Precambrian strata) likely served as a widespread regional conduit for dolomitizing brines. Presumed fault-controlled fractures, breccias and stratigraphic offsets suggest fault conduits created cross-formational flow to dolomitize the Beaverhill Lake and Wabamun reservoirs. Late-stage cements present in order of decreasing age are saddle dolomite, anhydrite, coarse calcite and quartz. Fluid inclusion homogenization (Th) and melting temperatures (Tm), depleted oxygen and carbon stable isotope ratios and radiogenic Sr suggest that brines that precipitated late-stage cements were hot and saline, and these brines probably had interacted with either the Precambrian basement or clastic sequences derived from the basement. The control on the distribution of late-stage cements appears to be structural, with reactivation of Devonian-Mississippian faults in the Late Cretaceous to Early Tertiary creating vertical fluid pathways for brines moving from downdip conduits. Measured %Bro (Bitumen reflectance) from isotropic bitumens are estimated to equal values of 1.75--2.02 %Ro (vitrinite reflectance). This agrees with (%Ro) reflectance of organic matter values of 1.73--1.95 found from Duvernay source rock intervals in the area. Maximum burial temperature estimates of (~180Â°C) are derived from %Ro ranges (182--194Â°C), maximum fluid inclusion temperatures of about 180--185Â°C from calcite cements and from burial history and maturation modeling (175--180Â°C). Maturation modeling and fluid inclusion gas analysis suggest that cementation overlapped with hydrocarbon emplacement and destruction and thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) processes. Hydrocarbon emplacement and saddle dolomite precipitation occurred at about 140Â°C--150Â°C and 4000--4500 in burial depths. Hydrocarbon destruction, anhydrite cementation, and pyrobitumen formation began at temperatures greater than 150Â°C and greater than 4500 m burial depths, with most calcite cementation occurring after hydrocarbon destruction and maximum burial (about 5400 m) during uplift in the Early Tertiary.</description><creator>Green, Darryl G.</creator><contributor>Mountjoy, E.

Genetic linkage, studies have implicated APP as a key mediator of Alzheimer's disease-type neuropathology. A catabolic fragment of APP, the Abeta peptide, is the core protein of the amyloid plaque that is a defining lesion in Alzheimer's disease brain. All inherited risk factors alter the generation and/or aggregation of Abeta and this observation has focused research efforts on elucidating the toxic properties of this peptide. However, the biology of APP is complex and our understanding of its role in the mature brain is very limited. In using our transfected clones, we found unexpected repression of APP expression when cells were grown as grafts in rat cortex, precluding analysis of how the adjacent brain might respond to chronically elevated levels of surface-expressed APP or of its secreted fragments. APP is highly expressed in neurons vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease neurodegeneration and evaluation of intracellular APP activities may help to determine the basis of their vulnerability. We developed a highly specific monoclonal antibody to a human Abeta epitope for use in high resolution electron microscopy of mature neuroectodermally differentiated P19 clones. We were able to localise APP fragments bearing this epitope and, in so doing, define sites of APP catabolism and reveal organelles spontaneously associated with these fragments. We approached the functional consequences of these intracellular associations by analysing 2 parameters of particular relevance to cell viability, namely oxidative metabolism and signal transduction.

After a brief historical chapter, reflections on divine action from authors in the philosophy of religion are considered. In chapters 2 and 3, concepts such as intervention, deism, master act and subacts, primary and secondary causation, double agency and the causal joint are outlined. Following this, chapters 4 and 5 concentrate on the work of Whitehead. The amount of space devoted to the treatment of process thought in this investigation reflects the attention it has given to the topic of divine activity. The focus then turns to scientific subjects and how they may inform the question of divine action. Some of the themes highlighted in the case of the large-scale world (chapter 6) include natural laws, evolution, the anthropic principle and the implicate order. Those concepts more appropriate for the small-scale world (chapter 7) involve quantum mechanics, thermodynamics and chaos theory. The positioning of process thought between the two fields of science and the philosophy of religion is strategic in the sense that process thinking claims to have built a bridge between science and religion, physics and metaphysics. In the concluding chapter, the various positions are plotted on three graphs. This approach illumines their relation to the others as well as the facet each can be expected to bring to the overall discussion of divine activity. A resolution to the issue, if any, will likely exhibit Whiteheadian and/or Bohmian contours.</description><creator>Gruning, Herb.</creator><contributor>Boutin, Maurice (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Philosophical theology.</subject><subject>Process philosophy.</subject><title>Divine-cosmic interaction : some contemporary alternatives</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j6731564v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/db78td864</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Religious Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1n79h6250</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:49:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Using the techniques of microhistory, this thesis explores questions of construction of identity, and the relationship of narrative to identity. The thesis follows the lives of several residents of the St. Lawrence valley as they learn about the residents of New York and New England through business, marriage, adoption and trade in furs. Using case studies of seventeenth-century native and European individuals, as well as information from folklore, parish registers, letters and legal documents, movement in the border region between settled colonies is examined. A nominal index describes the origins of, and provides capsule biographies for, 694 residents of New France whose roots were neither in France nor in the native communities. An examination of these cases allows a comparison between personal choice and social constraint in a colonial context.</description><creator>Gray, Linda Breuer.</creator><contributor>Desbarats, Catherine (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Canada -- History -- To 1763 (New France)</subject><subject>Saint Lawrence River -- History.</subject><subject>Social history.</subject><title>Narratives and identities in the Saint Lawrence Valley, 1667-1720</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0g354h011.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1n79h6250</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gm80hx16m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:49:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation examines the development of the female literary subject in the work of two generations of women writers of the GDR, represented by Christa Wolf (1929), Brigitte Reimann (1931--1973), Helga Konigsdorf (1936) and Helga Schubert (1941). The objectives are twofold: first, to assess the influence of two opposing discursive frameworks of subjectivity, the socialist and the psychoanalytic, on the works of these writers, and second, to examine the effects of an ideological disjuncture of two generations on their literary production. The first generation to embark on a literary career in the GDR, with great aspirations for the socialist project, is represented by Wolf and Reimann. A shift in political parameters meant that the following generation of writers, including Konigsdorf and Schubert, was faced with a pre-determined ideological structure, unsatisfactory to them. Accordingly, a diachronic investigation of the literary subject is pursued, and reveals the shift between these generations. As a result, rifts in time, in the subject, and rifts between the subject and its time are exposed. In the 1960s, Wolf and Reimann rejected the literary female subject's role as an agent in the implementation of socialism. Crises in GDR social structures and crises of the psyche are shown to overlap and to result in divided subjects. The non-contemporaneity of Marxism begins to surface in the 1970s, and the rift in time affects the female subjects of Wolf and Reimann, which increasingly fragment Konigsdorf's and Schubert's short prose of the late 1970s reveals a rejection of the unified Marxist subject and the move toward a notion of the self informed by Freudian psychoanalysis. In the 1980s, the effects of the socio-political environment prove fatal to the individual subject in the works by both generations, and parallels are drawn to the National Socialist past. These links instigate a fundamental reevaluation of standards in language, power and cycles of history at the crossroads of life and death. The post-Wende period witnesses a shift away from problems of subjectivity in the texts of Konigsdorf and Schubert, while Wolf initially experiments with the postmodern, and most recently, surprisingly re-consolidates the female subject.</description><creator>Dueck, Cheryl E.</creator><contributor>Goldsmith-Reber, Trudis (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Women authors, German -- Germany (East)</subject><subject>German fiction -- 20th century -- History and criticism.</subject><title>Rifts in time and in the self : two generations of GDR women writers and the development of the female subject (Christa Wolf, Brigitte Reimann, Helga KÃ¼nigsdorf, Helga Schubert)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cj82k886r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gm80hx16m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of German Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p5547t211</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:49:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The potential applicability of Fourier transform infrared (FM) spectroscopy for the study of biomolecules, has been investigated through the investigation of three specific applications. Two of the applications selected involve the classification of whole cells, whereas the third concerns the study of peptides and proteins isolated from tissues as well as synthetic peptides. In the microbiological application, for the differentiation of bacteria on the basis of their FTIR spectra, it has been found that classification is most efficiently achieved through the utilisation of artificial neural networks, and that a wide, variety of bacteria can be correctly identified with minimal sample preparation after being grown on a single growth medium. The suitability of low-cost, disposable materials as supports for the deposition of bacteria samples has also been demonstrated. In contrast to the successful classification of bacteria, it has been found that the examination of cytological smears by FTIR spectroscopy does not allow the classification of cervical cell populations into the recognised diagnostic categories. In a microscopic investigation of the same cell populations utilising infrared imaging, localised areas of the smear were found to exhibit distinct characteristics not observed in the spectra of the entire population. This indicates that infrared imaging system may be required for this type of application because the infrared spectrum recorded from a whole cervical smear does not allow the detection of the small spectral features arising from the molecular changes associated with a localised pathological state. Finally, the investigation of factors affecting the stability of peptides related to amyloidosis has shown that temperatures above 70Â°C, hydrostatic pressure greater than 6 kbar, and alkaline pH promote the disaggregation of the typical intermolecular beta-sheet structure of amyloid peptides.

The usual assumption in such situations is that the test results are statistically independent within each subject conditional on knowing the true disease status. This assumption greatly simplifies the statistical analysis of such data. In practice, however this assumption may be violated, as for example when there is a certain subject-related characteristic that may increase or decrease the probability of detection in two or more tests. The classical or frequentist solutions that account for the correlation between tests require a minimum of four different tests to obtain an identifiable solution. However, it is not always possible to have results from four different tests, particularly when tests are expensive, time consuming or invasive. Our objective in this thesis is to draw simultaneous inferences about the prevalence and test parameters while adjusting for the possibility of conditional dependence between tests, particularly in the situation when we have three or fewer tests, leading to a non-identifiable problem. We do so by way of a Bayesian approach, which utilizes available information about the prevalence and test parameters summarized in the form of prior distributions. The first of the two methods we propose models the dependence as a direct effect between each pair of tests. The second method uses a random effects model and simulates the dependence between tests via their sensitivity and specificity which are modeled as functions of a latent, subject-specific 'disease intensity'. Both models are based on dichotomous tests and the parameters are estimated using a Gibbs Sampler. It was found that ignoring the conditional dependence between tests could lead to misleading estimates of the sensitivities and specificities of the tests and of disease prevalence.

To guide the study, a conceptual framework of the transition to university was created by combining elements of relevant theoretical models in the counseling and higher education literature. A purposive sample of eight first year students was selected, equally distributed in terms of gender, entry status (high school vs. college), and actual or contemplated program of study (English vs. Physics). Data were collected by means of semi-structured interviews conducted at four points in the academic year. These were supplemented by class schedules, university documents, and classroom visits. Analysis of the interview data was conducted using the NUDÂ·IST software package. The results of the study suggest that students are strangers, in a strange land during their first semester at university. As they encounter successive sets of academic challenges throughout the semester, they are "learning the ropes" of functioning in this unfamiliar territory. In so doing, students are acquiring the experiential knowledge base that will allow them to survive in university. The results support the study's conceptualization of the transition to university, but also suggest that figure research in this area requires a more fine-grained and comprehensive model of the academic environment as experienced by students. Towards this end, the basic elements of an ecological perspective on the academic world of university students are presented. Areas of needed research related to the academic transition experiences of first year students are identified, and recommendations are made for improving orientation and academic advising, as well as course design and instructional practices.</description><creator>Denison, Donald Brian.</creator><contributor>Donald, Janet G.

As an aside, direct solid sample analysis (DSSA) on powdered sample was to be studied. To perform this double task, an "analytical chamber", described in chapter 2, was designed and made. The project was still at the preliminary studies stage on the usefulness of Swann bands as a probe for the presence of carbon to carbon bonds (Chapter 2), when the lack of funding forced a reorientation on the DSSA project as the main topic for the thesis. Since ICPs are known to be poor particle digesters, a suitable solid-gas reactor had to be found. From this study (Chapter 3), the cyclone reactor appeared to be the best-suited type of reactor for this task. Unfortunately, micro-engineering and gas flow rate constraints imposed by the ICP forced the abandonment of the concept for a simpler one. In parallel with the quest for a suitable DSSA reactor, a new calibration method, the tandem calibration method (TCM) was developed. The objective of the TCM was to achieve calibration of any sample introduction system with the use of classical liquid standards. The study showed clearly that not only did the TCM not bias the results, but it also automatically corrected for physico-chemical matrix effects in a manner similar to standard additions. Despite the fact that results presented in Chapter 4 were obtained on liquid samples, the TCM is equally applicable to solid samples introduced into the plasma by other means. The TCM was used on an electrothermal vaporizer (ETV) (see Appendix 3). The first DSSA system studied was modified direct sample insertion (MDSI). The MDSI used halogen-assisted sample vaporization and demonstrated that quantitative vaporization of solids could be achieved using the ICP as the thermal energy source (Chapter 5). The next step was to design a reactor along the same fines, but capable of operating under continuous sample feed from an appropriate powder feeder. This intraplasmic reactor, the pseudo fluidized-bed reactor (PFBR) did not perform as well as expected (Chapter 6). Still, it allowed the demonstration of the usefulness of a baffle placed in the path of the particles inside the reactor to achieve longer solid residence time. The results obtained on the PFBR indicated that although the general concept was good, the source of most problems came from inefficient energy transfer from the plasma to the reactor. This drawback was eliminated by replacing plasma heating with Ohmic (resistive) heating. Called the ohmically heated PFBR (OPFBR), this reactor imposed severe design constraints, principally in terms of electrode cooling and protection of the hot graphite reactor against attack from oxygen. The design required a series of modifications, described in Chapter 7, before reaching its final form (Chapter 8). Transport losses were a problem with the OPFBR. The introduction of a quenching gas through tangential holes in the upper body of the reactor faded to eliminate transport losses; however, these losses were sufficiently small and reproducible to allow quantitative analysis on real samples (SO-4 sod CRM and 1646 Estuarine sediment CRM) fed continuously into the reactor. These results fulfill the goal of this thesis, which was to develop a method for steady-state feed DSSA.</description><creator>Hamier, Jan.</creator><contributor>Salin, Eric D.

The production of certain immunoregulatory eicosanoids may help parasites to evade host immune responses and establish chronic infections. Our analysis of arachidonic acid metabolites synthesized by the adult trematode parasite Schistosoma mansoni indicated the presence of a soluble, enzymatically active lipoxygenase (LOX) and the absence of any cyclooxygenase (COX) activity. Screening of several S. mansoni cDNA libraries using mammalian LOX sequences resulted in the cloning of the mouse (the parasite host) LOX homologue due to the high sequence homology among the different mammalian lipoxygenases. In search of a more specific probe, the phylogenetically related nematode Caenorhabditis elegans DNA database was searched for arachidonic acid metabolizing enzyme-like sequences. Although no COX or LOX related sequences were revealed, a small expressed sequence tag (EST) (termed cm01c7) with strong homology to the human leukotriene A4 (LTA4) hydrolase was found. The C. elegans cm01c7 clone was used to screen S. mansoni cDNA libraries but failed to identify any homologous sequences from S. mansoni. On the other hand, the utilization of cm01c7 as a probe together with conventional hybridization screening and anchored polymerase chain reaction techniques resulted in the cloning of the full-length LTA4 hydrolase-like homologue, termed AP-1, from C. elegans . The AP-1 cDNA was expressed transiently in COS-7 mammalian cells and tested for LTA4 hydrolase and aminopeptidase activities. Despite the strong homology between the human LTA4 hydrolase and C. elegans AP-1 (45% identity at the amino acid level), reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay for LTB4 production revealed the inability of C. elegans AP-1 to use LTA4 as a substrate. In contrast, C. elegans A</description><creator>Abdel Baset, Heba.</creator><contributor>Ford-Hutchinson, Anthony W.

The popularity of his Pentateuch commentary has resulted in many extant manuscripts and printed editions, and the effect of scribal activity involved in the work's large circulation has led to extensive textual variants. Moreover, the earliest extant dated manuscript of the commentary was copied 130 years after Rashi's death. This extended length of time facilitated the introduction of countless changes into the work that, over time, have become virtually undetectable. One key to uncovering the most authentic version of Rashi's commentary is to examine texts written as close to his lifetime as possible. Since neither Rashi's own copy of his commentary nor any reasonable alternative has been discovered, the Pentateuch commentaries of his immediate successors, the Franco-German writers known as the Tosafot, provide the closest possible substitute. For the most part, the writings of these twelfth- and thirteenth-century relatives and students of Rashi consisted of glosses, explanations and criticisms of his work. This study compares citations of Rashi in over fifty manuscripts of Tosafot commentaries with texts of Rashi published in both early and modern printings and in over thirty manuscripts of his commentary. It suggests that the text of Rashi utilized by the Tosafot was significantly different from the printed versions. Examples show that portions of the printed interpretations attributed to Rashi are actually explanations and criticisms offered by the Tosafot that, through various processes, were attributed to the master himself. Awareness of this helps establish a reliable witness to the text of Rashi's Pentateuch commentary, and it suggests that the Tosafot must be an important component of any future efforts to establish a scientific edition of it.</description><creator>Abecassis, Deborah.</creator><contributor>Levy, B.

First, a variety of polymers containing NLO-active chromophores covalently bound to the siloxane backbones, [-R2Si-(O-SiR2)n-O-(NLO-Chromophore)-O-] n (R = CH3 or CH3/C6H4) and [-R2Si-(O-SiR2)n-O-R'-O-(NLO-Chromophore)-O-] n. (R' = -C6H4-C 6H4-C6H4-), were prepared. Their solubility in common organic solvents, and high thermal stability, imparted ease of thin film preparation, and subsequent poling at high temperatures. These polymers exhibit good second-harmonic generation susceptibilities, and the temporal stabilities of the SHG signals were dependent on the polymer backbone and the molecular structures of the NLO chromophoms. A detailed analysis of their physical properties is reported. Then, a methodology of acid-base hydrolysis was used to produce copolymers containing dimethylsiloxane, imide linkages and NLO-active chromophores. These copolymers were soluble in polar solvents, and possessed high thermal stabilities and glass transition temperatures. Easily fabricated and poled thin films of these polymers exhibited good second-order nonlinear optical susceptibilities with long-term temporal stabilities of the second-harmonic generation signals at room temperature. Finally, an alternative approach, based on the same acid-base hydrolysis technique, to prepare organic-inorganic hybrid network material, was developed. In these hybrid materials, NLO-active chromophores such as Disperse Red 19, a pyridinium. salt based dye, and 1-amino-4-nitrobenzene, were covalently locked into silica networks. The hybrids were soluble, and offered ease of processibility in the preparation of good optical quality thin films. The network materials that are akin to the traditional sol-gel approach were also prepared</description><creator>Jiang, Hongwei, 1962-</creator><contributor>Kakkar, Ashok (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Chemistry, Inorganic.</subject><subject>Chemistry, Organic.</subject><subject>Physics, Optics.</subject><title>Functionalized siloxane based polymers and network materials for second-order nonlinear optics</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cf95jd02p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r494vm71h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kd17cv707</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:49:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The performance of mineral grinding circuits strongly affects downstream processes such as flotation and cyanidation, and grinding is often the single most expensive unit operation. Hence, optimization efforts must be made on a regular basis to maintain and improve its technical and economic efficiency. The focus of this thesis, off-line optimization of grinding circuits, is based on the mathematical modelling of process units such as ball mills and hydrocyclones. To complete an optimization task, a mineral process engineer must possess skills and knowledge pertaining to the different stages involved in such effort, available software tools and interpretation of results. A prototype knowledge-based system, Grinding Circuits Optimization Supervisor (GCOS), has been developed in CLIPS (C Language Integrated Production System) to assist a non-expert mineral process engineer to do off-line optimization studies. Due to the importance of the correct estimation of back-calculated mill selection function in grinding optimization studies, a spline curve fitting algorithm has been used to improve their quality. The linkage of the algorithms for the selection function estimation, spline curve fitting, selection function scaling for different ball sizes and single ball mill simulation has provided a useful tool, Numerical Grinding Optimization Tools in C (NGOTC) for circuit analysis and grinding media size optimization. The smoothed estimated or scaled selection functions can be used subsequently in Ball Milling Circuits Simulator (BMCS) to perform full circuit simulations. Data from a number of mineral processing plants including Agnico Eagle (La Ronde Division), Les Mine Selbaie, Les Mines Casa Berardi, Lupin Mine, Dome Mine and Louvicourt Mine were used to develop and test NGOTC, BMCS and GCOS. The results of data analysis and circuit simulations of some of these plants are presented, and the impact of some suggested actions is given and discussed.</description><creator>Farzanegan, Akbar.</creator><contributor>Lowther, D.
