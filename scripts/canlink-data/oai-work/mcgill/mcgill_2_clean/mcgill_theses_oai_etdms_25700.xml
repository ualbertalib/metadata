Inspired by some deconstructionist sociological methods, the theoretical framework is based on hegemony and social discourse. A review of the literature unveils the major cognitive models which deal with photojournalism and comments the context of information in Quebec. A computerized and hermeneutic analysis coupled with a review of the interaction of the image with the page support the inferences. Not only some disturbing disparities are shown in the visual representation, but those disparities appear to be submitted to the current doxic rules. Finally, a synthesis establishes the hegemonical convergences which support those values and presents the ideological activities of photojournalism. The researcher draws his conclusion from the current process of information and is worried of its impact on the capacity of self-governing.</description><creator>Corriveau, Raymond, 1950-</creator><date>1987</date><subject>Communication</subject><subject>French-Canadian newspapers -- Québec (Province)</subject><subject>Photojournalism -- Québec (Province)</subject><subject>Visual communication</subject><title>La photographie dans les quotidiens : l'analyse d'un champ doxique banalisé</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nc580n238.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fn106z78k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Graduate Communications Program</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:s4655h281</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:17:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><creator>Mestier du Bourg, Hubert de.</creator><date>1974</date><subject>Matrimonial actions -- Canada.</subject><subject>Divorce -- Canada</subject><title>Etude comparative des causes et des effets du divorce en droit canadien</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m326m2389.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s4655h281</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Civil Law</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mw22v608n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:17:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><creator>Levy, Claude M.

This broad legal regime represents directly applicable general principles, and laws and regulations of mostly indirect application. This is to be expected in view of the emergent nature of commercial space endeavours. In examining applicable national law, consideration must first be given to the effect of international treaties in place. Whether treaty provisions prescribe rules of law by their own terms is particularly important in this regard. The issue of liability for the conduct of space related activities is of prime importance for participants. The nature of liability is an influential factor for an entity in deciding whether or not to undertake an endeavour. As well, methods of managing liability risks may prove advantageous in encouraging further participation. The establishment of private commercial space launch vehicle operations is subject to a plethora of administrative regulations emanating from a variety of government bodies. These must be delineated and assessed with a view to providing recommendations for modification. Space insurance, which can be considered today as a discrete type of coverage, is undergoing changes in order to better deal with present requirements and accommodate future needs. A final area of study is that of dispute settlement in commercial space matters. Existing procedures must be considered and assessed with the ultimate aim being the submission of recommendations for improved methods of resolving differences.</description><creator>Nesgos, Peter D.</creator><date>1983</date><subject>Law.</subject><title>National law and commercial activities in outer space : specific aspects of United States law applicable to space industrialization with particular emphasis on the commercialization of launch vehicle transportation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/02870w50h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n583xv665</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Civil Law</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vd66w0581</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:17:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The introduction of this dissertation discusses geopolitical and socio-economic factors which influence transportation in Africa. Chapters II and III, respectively, analyse the concept of regionalism and the legal framework of multinational civil aviation co-operation. The economic advantages of surface and air transportation are compared in Chapter IV. Chapter V is a general survey of the impact of nationalism on sociopolitical problems in economic and aeronautical co-operation, the former East African Community is reviewed in Chapter VI. The demised East African regional carrier is specifically discussed in Chapter VII. Chapter VIII highlights the notion of functionalism as an approach to the attainment of socio-economic integration. Multilateral organizations responsible for coordinating and fostering co-operation are examined in Chapters IX, X and XI. Current regional activities and future prospects are assessed in the penultimate chapter. The Conclusion contains the essential elements required in creating regional airlines in Africa.</description><creator>Kaunda, Gideon H.</creator><date>1983</date><subject>Law.</subject><title>The regional integration of commercial air transport in Africa : political, economic and legal considerations</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6w924c42p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vd66w0581</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Civil Law</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:05741s43b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:17:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><creator>Smith, Thomas D.</creator><date>1979</date><subject>Biology, Entomology.</subject><title>The effects of six insecticides on non-target soil mesoarthropods from pasture on Ste.

The attempt is made first to develop a framework for comparing theoretically the role of ethnic groups in various governmental systems. Once completed, the various conceptual assumptions are applied to the activities of domestic ethnic interest groups in the United States and Canada concerned with policy for the Middle East and the Arab-Israel conflict. The focus is primarily on the American and Canadian pro-Israel lobbies during the period between October 1973 and September 1982. Data for domestic Arab ethnic constituencies are also considered where relevant, but more as logical counter-points to the North American Jewish communities than as bases for full and complete cross-ethnic comparison. The principal objective of this study is to compare the political influence of two interest groups of the same faith and fundamental purpose but of different systems of government and political cultures.</description><creator>Goldberg, David Howard.</creator><date>1986</date><subject>Pressure groups -- United States.</subject><subject>Arabs -- United States -- Politics and government.</subject><subject>Canada -- Politics and government -- 20th century</subject><subject>Arabs -- Canada -- Politics and government.</subject><subject>United States -- Politics and government -- 20th century</subject><subject>Jews -- United States -- Politics and government.</subject><subject>Jews -- Canada -- Politics and government.</subject><subject>Pressure groups -- Canada.</subject><title>Ethnic interest groups as domestic sources of foreign policy : a theoretical and empirical inquiry</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j098zb730.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3f462613w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0p096772b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:17:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In currently used shear rheometers, shear stress is inferred from a measurement of either total force or total torque. These methods are subject to experimental errors due to uncontrolled flow at the sample boundaries. Such errors can be avoided by measuring the shear stress locally, in the region of controllable flow, using a shear stress transducer. A new sliding plate rheometer for molten plastics has been developed to incorporate a recently developed shear stress transducer. The rheometer operates at temperatures up to 250$ sp circ$C. Static and dynamic calibrations showed that the shear stress transducer sensitivity is stable and that its frequency response is suitable for the study of molten plastics. This rheometer was equipped with a computer controlled servohydraulic linear actuator, which provided wide flexibility in shear history selection. Digital data acquisition and signal processing enabled the use of the discrete Fourier transform for nonlinear viscoelastic property determination. Important differences were observed between the locally measured shear stress and values inferred from total force in both large amplitude oscillatory shear and in reciprocating exponential shear tests. For these property measurements, free boundary errors can dominate the dynamics of total force measurements.</description><creator>Giacomin, A.

Specific techniques are listed for the design of musical space and time in Guacamayo, which is "a musical drama that strives for synthesis." There follows an outline of the principle motivic material, approaches to melodic construction and text setting, techniques used to design space (or pitch) and time (or rhythm)--including traditional harmony, symmetrical modes, non-octaviating space and random number generation in the first case, and speech rhythm, folk rhythm, metre and tempo in the second--as well as the role of summation series in the construction of both time and space. A discussion of dialectic concepts, and the ways in which different techniques are combined to create a sense of motion between simple textures and complex ones leads to consideration of form-determining placement of important scenes from the opera. Comments on the composition of the orchestra and electroacoustic music conclude the essay.</description><creator>Oliver, E. John C.

PONs are expected to solve the problem of limited bandwidth, the so called "first and last mile problem", that remains the bottleneck between the backbone network and high-speed local area networks (LANs). PONs provide a low-cost solution and a guaranteed quality of service (QoS) to enable new multimedia services. In a PON, multiple users share the fiber infrastructure in a point-to-multipoint (P2MP) network topology. This is in contrast to current access technologies, including DSL, VDSL, and cable, which use a point-to-point (P2P) network topology. The P2MP nature of networks introduces optical path delays which inherently cause the data packets to undergo amplitude, phase, and frequency variations - burst, mode trafic. This consequently creates new challenges for the design of optical receivers. Optical receivers, and in particular, burst-mode receiver front-ends (BM-RXs) and burst-mode clock and data recovery circuits (BM-CDRs), must adapt to burst-mode traffic, where data bursts originate from various sources and travel different distances. The amplitude and phase of successive packets may therefore vary anywhere between 0--20 dB and --pi to +pi rads. The research objective of this thesis is to design, test, and enhance performance requirements of BM-CDRs for PONs. We design and experimentally demonstrate a 622/1244 Mb/s BM-CDR with forward error correction (FEC) using Reed-Solomon (R-S(255, 239)) codes for Gigabit PONs (GPONs). We measure a coding gain of approximately 5 dB at bit error ratio (BER) of 10-10. The coding gain obtained verifies the claim of the increased link budget specified by ITU-T G.984.3 standard. We also develop a novel technique for fast burst-error correction for bursty channels. This is achieved by employing FEC on BM-CDRs with fast phase acquisition time. We demonstrate this with our custom built bit error rate tester/analyzer (BBERT/A). Finally, we develop a small-signal modeling technique for characterizing photodiodes. This technique is based on the measurement of S 11 parameters. We demonstrate our idea with a 10 GHz 1310/1550 nm InGaAs/InP PIN photodiode.</description><creator>Shastri, Bhavin Jayprakash.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Optical communications.</subject><subject>Optoelectronics.</subject><title>Burst-mode clock and data recovery with FEC for passive optical networks</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Bhavin Jayprakash Shastri, 2007</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/st74cq69w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1n79h466t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0k225b288</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:17:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The need to develop light-weight and high strength materials for car frames which improve fuel efficiency and provide increased passenger safety during dynamic events such as automobile crashes has been the focus of the steel and automobile industries for the past 30 years. In recent years, the development of high strength steels such as multi-phase TRIP (Transformation-Induced Plasticity)-aided steels have shown great promise due to their excellent combination of high strength and ductility. The savings in automobile weight is provided by the inherent strength of TRIP steels which allows for the use of thinner sections. The TRIP effect is characterized by the phenomenon known as strain-induced martensitic transformation (SIMT) which enhances the work hardenability of such steels as the austenite phase transforms to the much harder martensite phase during plastic straining. This results in a resistance to local necking which subsequently enhances the strength, ductility, and formability of such steels. However, various factors exist which affect the mechanical behaviour of TRIP steels. This study will aim, through the use of finite element models, to investigate the role and influence of each of these factors on the TRIP effect in type 304 austenitic and multi-phase TRIP steels. These factors include the rate at which the martensitic transformation proceeds, the state of stress to which the material is subjected to, the interaction between the surrounding matrix and embedded retained austenite islands in multi-phase TRIP steels, and the volume fraction and morphology of the retained austenite islands. Investigation of these factors will provide further insight on each of their contributions to the TRIP effect in order to exploit the potential benefits offered by these steels.</description><creator>Sierra, Robinson.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Bainitic steel -- Mechanical properties -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Martensitic transformations.</subject><subject>Steel -- Mechanical properties -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Ferritic steel -- Mechanical properties -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Austenitic steel -- Mechanical properties -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Steel -- Metallography.</subject><title>Investigation of the mechanical behaviour of TRIP steels using FEM</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Robinson Sierra, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3b591881k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0k225b288</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pr76f3688</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:17:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Human stance in quiet mode, relies on feedback from eyes, skin, muscles and the inner ear and the control produced is a combination of strategies which enable a person to stay standing. This thesis presents the simulation and control of a hip actuated robotic model of human standing posture. The first part of the thesis is devoted to recalling basic elements of the human balance system and to describe the balance strategies it uses to maintain an upright stance. Of the strategies presented, we consider the hip strategy which motivated the formulation of a hip actuated robot. An investigation into the control of nonlinear underactuated robots by linear controllers is done to verify the range and efficiency of the controlled system. The second part of the thesis includes the investigation of two simplified models of the robot. Results using linear state feedback control are presented. The two models used are compared to clarify the use of one over the other. We found that for linear controls, the size of the region of convergence decreased underactuated systems of increasing complexity. For our four degrees of freedom robot, the region of convergence is of 2.3 degrees for the actuated joints and of 1 degree for the unactuated joints. Our system is Lyapunov stable when the fully simplified model is assumed.</description><creator>Sood, Gaurav.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Robots -- Motion -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Robots -- Control systems -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Standing position.</subject><title>Simulation and control of a hip actuated robotic model for the study of human standing posture</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Gaurav Sood, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n009w255c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pr76f3688</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xs55mc313</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:17:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Conventional beamformers can be sensitive to mismatches between presumed and actual steering vectors of the signal-of-interest. A recently proposed class of robust beamformers aim to counteract this problem by using a non-attenuation constraint inside a single hypersphere centered at the presumed steering vector of the signal-of-interest. In an effort to strike a balance between robustness to steering vector error and interference-plus-noise suppression, we propose in this manuscript to use multiple concentric hyperspheres instead of one with different degrees of protection in each. We derive several useful properties of this multiply constrained beamformer and use numerical simulations to show that using two constraints yields improved signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio compared to one constraint in certain scenarios, particularly at a large input signal-to-noise-ratio. The manuscript also includes an overview of conventional beamforming, the mismatch problem and previously proposed robust beamformers.</description><creator>Robinson, Michael, 1982-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Antenna arrays.</subject><title>Robust minimum variance beamforming with multiple response constraints</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Michael Robinson, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3f462572v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xs55mc313</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0p096724p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:17:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Dual-phase (DP) steels consisting of a ferrite matrix with dispersed martensite particles have attracted a significant interest due to their combination of high work hardening and ductility. A great deal of experimental work has been done to obtain a better comprehension of the relation of their mechanical behaviour to their microstructural characteristics. In the present work, a micromechanical study of ferrite-martensite DP steels is conducted. The deformation of ferrite is described by a rate-dependent crystal plasticity theory, which relates the stress-strain field equations on the grain level to the macroscopic behaviour of the material. The crystal plasticity theory assumes that slip is the only deformation mechanism. Martensite, on the other hand, is considered an elastic-plastic isotropic solid. The interfaces of the grains are taken into account through an idealized form of grain boundaries. A FORTRAN program was coupled with the finite element method to solve the stress equations of the crystal plasticity. Including the grain boundaries made it possible to examine the effect of ferrite grain size on the strength of the material. It is shown that by decreasing the grain size, the yield stress increases according to Hall-Petch equation. Additionally, the effects of the volume fraction of martensite (Vm) on the onset strain, i.e. the strain at which martensite deforms plastically, and of the distribution of martensite on the stress are studied. The former showed that the onset strain of the DP steel declines linearly with increasing Vm up to 36%, beyond which the onset strain becomes independent of V m. The latter revealed that when martensite particles are formed as islands in the ferrite grains, the material exhibits higher strength and hardening rate; compared to when martensite is distributed as large blocks among the ferrite grains.</description><creator>Mahmoody, Sam.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Steel -- Mechanical properties -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Martensite -- Mechanical properties -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Ferritic steel -- Mechanical properties -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Steel -- Metallography.</subject><title>Micromechancal modeling of dual-phase steel using a rate-dependent crystal plasticity model</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Sam Mahmoody, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q811kj87m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0p096724p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hx11xf505</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:17:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Many studies have demonstrated that sewage treatment plants do not efficiently degrade pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics, hormones, and analgesics. Ozonation has been identified as a promising technique to degrade those compounds. A series of experiments was used to evaluate the impact of three parameters on the efficiency and kinetics of degradation of sulfamethoxazole, an antibiotic, by ozonation. An ozone reactor was designed to perform experiments. Analytical techniques, based on liquid and gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, were developed to measure concentrations of sulfamethoxazole and identify degradation products. It was shown that the rate constant and the degradation efficiency are greater when the initial concentration of sulfamethoxazole is lower; the presence of other contaminants in solution decreases the percentage of degradation observed, and the concentration of hydrogen peroxide, used as catalyst, must be well adjusted since an inappropriate concentration hinders the reaction. Finally, the analysis of ozonated samples allowed the identification of degradation products and resulted in a proposed degradation mechanism.</description><creator>Leclair, Christine.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Ozonization.</subject><subject>Sulfamethoxazole.</subject><subject>Sewage -- Purification -- Ozonization.</subject><title>Ozonation of sulfamethoxazole in wastewater</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Christine Leclair, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sx61dm562.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hx11xf505</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gx41mj191</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:17:08Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Oscillator circuits are an integral component of wireless communications systems and are increasingly in demand. As such systems gain widespread use, price becomes a very important factor in the design process, and the design cycle must be optimized. This puts an increasing emphasis on the proficiency of oscillator design automation tools. At the same time, as the performance requirements of such systems are becoming more stringent, the required simulation complexity is also increasing. More specifically, high frequency selectivity and low phase noise require very high quality factor oscillators, which in turn negatively affect the convergence performance of current simulation techniques. This thesis proposes a new continuation method for improving the convergence of oscillator simulations and compares this method to some of the methods reported in the literature. The proposed approach does not require a very good initial guess in order to converge to a final solution.</description><creator>Lee, Chong Kyong, 1973-</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Oscillators, Electric -- Computer simulation.</subject><subject>Radio frequency oscillators -- Design and construction.</subject><title>Continuation methods for steady state analysis of oscillators</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Chong Kyong Lee, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0r967395n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gx41mj191</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1r66j128n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:17:08Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Wind loading considered in the design of overhead transmission lines is based on extreme values of synoptic wind, i.e. boundary layer wind originating from largescale meteorological pressure systems. Localized high intensity wind (HIW) storms such as tornadoes and downbursts are a different type of extreme wind frequently causing failures of overhead lines. This thesis covers the design aspects of overhead transmission lines when subject to localized HIW storms. A comprehensive review of the literature is included on the effects of such wind storms on lines and on mitigation measures. Furthermore, several options for the design of self-supporting transmission towers against localized HIW are discussed based on numerical simulations of several simple load cases on four examples of lattice structures.</description><creator>Langlois, Sébastien, 1981-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Wind resistant design.</subject><subject>Storm winds.</subject><subject>Overhead electric lines -- Design and construction.</subject><title>Design of overhead transmission lines subject to localized high intensity wind</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Sébastien Langlois, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8k71nh38m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1r66j128n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1n79h4673</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:17:08Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>It is widely accepted that the initial event that significantly influences biocompatibility is the nearly instantaneous adsorption of proteins from biological fluids onto the biomaterial surface. For blood-contacting devices, the complex layer of adsorbed plasma proteins is generally unfavourable and leads to major complications, including thrombus formation, inflammatory tissue responses, and microbial infections. Furthermore, protein interaction with passive films on metallic biomaterial surfaces may contribute to enhanced in vivo corrosion. To gain a better understanding of this phenomenon, the present thesis investigated the fundamental aspects of the interaction of the serum protein fibrinogen with a medical-grade stainless steel 316LVM surface using electrochemical and IR spectroscopy techniques. Aspects of this interaction included the thermodynamics and kinetics of fibrinogen adsorption, the effect of fibrinogen adsorption on the corrosion behavior of 316LVM stainless steel, and the conformational changes of fibrinogen upon its adsorption onto the stainless steel surface. It was shown that fibrinogen readily adsorbs onto the 316LVM stainless steel surface. Increases in the bulk protein concentration resulted in a corresponding increase of the surface coverage, a dependence that was described by the Langmuir isotherm. Large, negative values of the calculated Gibbs energy of adsorption indicated a highly spontaneous and strong adsorption of fibrinogen onto the 316LVM stainless steel at all investigated temperatures. Although the adsorption process was shown to be endothermic under the applied experimental conditions, the primary driving force for the adsorption process was found to be the positive entropy gain that arises from structural loss and/or rearrangement of the protein upon adsorption, as well as dehydration of the protein and stainless steel surface during the adsorption process. Kinetic measurements indicated that fibrinogen adsorption occurs rapidly. It was determined that for short contact times (1 hour), the addition of fibrinogen to the electrolyte enhanced the corrosion rate of the 316LVM stainless steel at the open circuit potential. For longer contact times (24 hours), an increase in the polarization resistance values was obtained, indicating an enhanced corrosion resistance of the material. It was postulated that the protein was not capable of complexing the well-stabilized passive film, and instead remained adsorbed to form a protective barrier to diffusion of oxygen-containing species from the electrolyte to the stainless steel surface. The secondary structure of the surface-adsorbed fibrinogen molecules was investigated by modeling the experimental PM-IRRAS spectra. It was shown that the protein lost a certain extent of its secondary structure upon adsorption to the steel surface. Fibrinogen molecules adsorbed from more dilute solutions were also shown to possess a lower alpha-helical content than those adsorbed from more concentrated solutions, suggesting they laid on the stainless steel surface in a more linear configuration.</description><creator>Desroches, Marie-Josée.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Metals in surgery.</subject><subject>Fibrinogen.</subject><subject>Blood proteins -- Absorption and adsorption.</subject><title>Electrochemical and PM-IRRAS studies of the interaction of plasma protein fibrinogen with a biomedical-grade 316LVM stainless steel surface</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Marie-Josée Desroches, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jd472w71f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1n79h4673</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):25725</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
