To study plant productivity, five commercially in vitro propagated elite strawberry cultivars ('Chambly', 'Glooscap', 'Joliette', 'Kent', and 'Sweet Charlie') were not inoculated with AM fungi or were inoculated with either a single species (Glomus intraradices), or a mixture of species (G. intraradices, Glomus mosseae, and Glomus etunicatum). AM inoculation was found to impact strawberry plant productivity in a soil with excessive P levels. The AM fungi introduced into the field by inoculated mother plants established a mycelial network in the soil through colonization of the daughter plant roots, however, persistence of colonization was determined to below (&lt;12% in inoculated plant roots). In soils excessively rich in P, individual crop inoculation may be the only option for management of the symbiosis, as the host and non-host rotation crops, planted prior to strawberry production, had no effect on plant productivity or soil mycorrhizal potential. To study the impact of AM inoculation on fruit production, three commercially grown strawberry cultivars (Glooscap, Joliette, and Kent) were not inoculated with AM fungi or were inoculated with either G. intraradices or G. mosseae. AM fungi impacted the fruit yield, with all inoculated cultivars producing more fruit than noninoculated cultivars during the first harvest year. The percentage of root colonization could not be used to explain the differences in total fruit yield during the first harvest year, or the increase in total fruit yield the second harvest year. We wished to examine the effects of various P treatments on C metabolism within the intraradical mycelia (IRM) of the fungus. Specific primers were developed for the Glomus intraradices glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) gene. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) was used to measure the gene expression of the G. intrarardices G6PDH gene in response to external P conditions of colonized transformed carrot roots. The results showed a significant down-regulation of G6PDH in the IRM of G. intraradices when cultures were grown in a high P (350 muM P) medium compared to those grown in the low P (35 muM P) medium. The down-regulation may suggest a reduction in the C flow from the host to the fungus. There was no effect on G6PDH expression following a two-hour incubation with additional P applications (No P, low P and high P).</description><creator>Stewart, Lynda Irene.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Glomus intraradices.</subject><subject>Soils -- Phosphorus content.</subject><subject>Strawberries.</subject><subject>Glomus mosseae.</subject><title>Phosphorus effects on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Lynda Irene Stewart, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x346d8313.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qz20sz04q</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:m613n2716</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The primary focus of this study was to assess children's and adolescents' perceptions of the ways in which peers respond to stressful conflicts that occur amongst them. Key variables that were examined were the social context (a dyad relationship versus a group relationship) and the social atmosphere (a compatible relationship versus an incompatible relationship) in which the conflict occurred. Scenarios were developed to simulate, as close as possible, realistic stressful conflicts that might typically arise in the daily lives of school age children and adolescents. Children and adolescents across three grade levels (1, 5, and 10) were administered a peer report measure in which they indicated to what extent they believed their same-sex peers would respond aggressively. The first part of the procedure required participants to listen to either a social scenario (someone who had been a member of a club was asked to leave) or an academic scenario (someone was given a bad grade by a peer) that described a conflict between two protagonists. The results of this study revealed that, as predicted, females endorsed significantly more aggressive responses for the compatible dyad context compared to the compatible group, incompatible dyad and incompatible group contexts. This finding occurred for overt, covert and withdrawn forms of aggression. These findings were also consistent across the three grade levels. Contrary to the hypothesis, males did not believe that their peers would behave differently across social contexts or atmospheres. Males did however report a higher level of overt and withdrawn aggression than females when the dyad and group conditions were combined. There were no gender differences in the aggressive responses for covert aggression. The implications of females' beliefs that degree of aggression would be highest in the intimate compatible dyad relationship compared to the other relationship contexts were discussed.</description><creator>Sinclair, Nancy L.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Interpersonal conflict in adolescence.</subject><subject>Interpersonal conflict in children.</subject><title>Children's and adolescents' reports of reactions to interpersonal conflicts in dyads versus groups</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Nancy L.

Structurally, PABP consists of two distinct regions. The N-terminal half contains four RNA recognition motifs that bind to the poly (A)-tail of mRNA, while the C-terminal segment contains a unique peptide binding module referred to as the PABC domain. The function of this domain in PABP is to recruit proteins containing a very specific 'PAM-2' motif to the mRNP complex. Unique to metazoans, a PABC domain is also found in the hyperplastic discs tumor suppressor (HYD), which is an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This thesis completes a structural investigation of PABC domains from various species by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In particular, we report the solution structure of PABC from the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and plant Triticum aevestium PABP. Both domains consist of five alpha-helices which fold into a structure highly comparable to the human PABC domain from PABP and HYD. All four PABCs interact with a similar PAM-2 sequence and show comparable peptide binding surfaces. The human PABC-PAM-2 complex structure displays a PAM-2 peptide interacting with specific residues within the domain. Sequence analyses and peptide surface mapping studies show that these residues are highly conserved, which indicates an analogous mechanism of peptide recognition throughout animal, parasite, and plant species. An exception to these observations was found in the PABC domain from Saccharomyces cerevisiae PABP. Yeast PABC recognizes a variation of the typical PAM-2 motif but mediates its interaction through a similar mechanism as human PABC. The PAM-2 motif encloses a signature sequence which was used to successfully identify new interacting partners for the PABC domain via a bioinformatics screen. In mammalian systems, the identified proteins are implicated in either RNA metabolic, translational, or ubiquitin associated functions. This thesis concludes with a model illustrating a unique cross-talk between major gene expression pathways mediated by the PABC domain and its binding partners.</description><creator>Siddiqui, Nadeem.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><title>Structure and function of the PABC domain</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Nadeem Siddiqui, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5d86p459m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gb19fb188</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rr172233n</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Globally, an estimated 25% of the CO2 and 90% of the N2O is believed to come from agroecosystems. The objective of this study was to investigate the dynamics of the below-ground CO 2 and N2O concentrations and efflux in corn and soybean systems. In our field study, changes in the below-ground concentrations of CO 2 and N2O were closely related to seasonal changes in soil moisture, with the first two months of the growing season being particularly critical to the production of these gases. Tillage significantly increased CO2 content in the soil profile, however, this effect was greater in the soybean plots than in the corn plots. In our greenhouse studies, an average of about 79% of the soil respiration in corn came from rhizosphere respiration, compared to an estimated 58% in the case of soybean. Specific rhizosphere respiration was significantly higher in soybean (0.29 mg C g -1 root h-1) than corn (0.09 mg C g-1 root h-1), which supports previous observations made with regards to slower-growing plants (e.g. soybean) having relatively higher root respiration than faster growing plants. We observed a nonsignificant difference between N2O efflux in the soybean-planted soil and unplanted bulk soil, which is in contrast to the perception that legumes could stimulate more N 2O production from the soil by increasing the N pool through N 2 fixation. While corn had the greatest uptake of fertilizer N, N 2O efflux in corn pots was higher (2.84 mug N pot-1 h-1) than the soybean pots (0.06 mug N pot-1 h-1). In the laboratory setting, denitrification in the microaggregates proceeded at about 4.4 to 39.6 times higher rate than in large macroaggregates, small macroaggregates or the bulk soil, and showed the greatest response to high moisture levels (80% WFPS).</description><creator>Sey, Benjamin Kweku.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Atmospheric carbon dioxide.</subject><subject>Atmospheric nitrous oxide.</subject><subject>Soil air.</subject><subject>Soybean -- Soils.</subject><subject>Corn -- Soils.</subject><subject>Plants -- Respiration.</subject><title>Carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide production from corn and soybean agroecosystems</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Benjamin Kweku Sey, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4x51hp592.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rr172233n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:v692tb50w</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this thesis was to evaluate microinvasive technology for the management of non-palpable mammographic findings with high risk for breast cancer. The specific objectives were, for the first part, to evaluate the Advanced Breast Biopsy Instrumentation System (ABBI) as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool for breast disease. For the second part, the objective was to evaluate lymphoscintigraphy with a malignancy specific radioactive agent (99m Technetium Sestamibi) as a non-surgical staging tool for breast cancer. Design. The thesis consists of two observational studies. The first study was partially retrospective and partially prospective. The second study was prospective. The research was conducted between September 1997 and December 2001. Methods. For the first study 262 women with non-palpable mammographic abnormalities were enrolled. Of these, 260 women underwent an ABBI. The ABBI procedure was performed by 3 surgeons in two hospitals in Montreal. The files of 531 women with similar findings who underwent a wire localization excisional biopsy in the same hospitals by the same surgeons were retrospectively reviewed. Data obtained included technical success, macroscopic and microscopic clarity of margins, need for supplemental surgery and residual cancer, volume of breast tissue excised, patient satisfaction, surgeon volume-performance association and health care costs. For the second study, 110 women with confirmed operable primary breast cancer who required axillary lymph node dissection were enrolled. All the patients underwent two lymphoscintigraphies. The first (preliminary) lymphoscintigraphy took place at least 2 weeks before surgery and the second (preoperative) took place 2-24 hours before surgery. For the preliminary lymphoscintigraphy, 47 (42.7%) of the 110 women were tested with 99mTechnetium Sestamibi and 63 (57.3%) were tested with 99mTechnetium Sulphur Colloid. For the preoperative lymphoscintigraphy all patients were tested with 99mTechnetium Sulphur Colloid. All patients underwent axillary lymph nodes dissection. The data reviewed was the presence of metastasis in the axillary lymph nodes excised and the lymphoscintigraphy gamma camera imaging and gamma probe digital outcomes. The ROC curve was used to define the most probable cut-off points for the distinction between gamma counts representing positive and negative for metastasis axillary lymph nodes. Results. For the first study, diagnostic effectiveness of the ABBI was 99.6% and the mean volume of excised breast tissue was 40cc. No serious complications were reported. For wire localization, the diagnostic effectiveness was 98.0% and the mean volume of excised breast tissue was 102cc. severity of complications was similar between the two techniques. The therapeutic effectiveness of the ABBI was 76.3%, supplementary surgery was required in 27.6% of the patients, and residual cancer was detected in 23.8%. The therapeutic effectiveness of wire localization biopsy was 47.0%, 53% of the patients underwent supplementary surgery and residual tumor was found in 48.0%. Of the 260 patients who underwent an ABBI, 51% reported a good level of satisfaction and 23% reported excellent. A significant association was shown between volume and therapeutic effectiveness for all 3 surgeons. On the average, the ABBI resulted in a cost reduction of $5,352 CAD (2000). For the second study, the sensitivity of 99mTechnetium Sestamibi lymphoscintigraphy imaging was 50%, the negative predictive value was 83.8% and the proportion of false negative results was 17.1%. Logistic regression showed a statistically significant (p&lt;0.001) association between the gamma probe counts and axillary lymph node metastasis. Using 3,080 counts as cut-off point on the ROC curve the sensitivity and false negative rate were 100%, the specificity was 94.3%, and the positive predictive value was 83.3%. Conclusion. The results of the first study show that the ABBI offers a safe and well tolerated microinvasive surgical technique, with superior therapeutic effectiveness, less invasiveness, and better cost effectiveness than wire localization excisional biopsy. The strong volume-performance association shows that the therapeutic effectiveness of the ABBI can improve with proper training and experience. The results of the second study show that 99mTechnetium Sestamibi lymphoscintigraphy imaging was 50% the negative predictive value was 83.8% and the proportion of false negative results was 17.1%. A significant association was shown between the intensity of radioactivity in the hot node as measured by the gamma-probe counts and the presence of axillary lymph node metastasis. In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates that both the ABBI and lymphoscintigraphy with 99mTechnetium Sestamibi are superior to conventional techniques used for the management of mammographic abnormalities and specifically breast cancer. Proper training of surgeons in highly qualified training centers with a high volume of cases can help further improve the effectiveness and increase the practise of these techniques in Canadian hospitals. This may in turn increase the benefits for the patients and reduce the healthcare costs for the management of breast disease and specifically breast cancer in Canada.</description><creator>Sampalis, Fotini.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><title>Microinvasive technology for the diagnosis and staging of breast cancer</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Fotini Sampalis, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gx41mp03z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v692tb50w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rn301562k</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Convergent evidence suggests that psychomotor stimulant drugs, such as amphetamine and cocaine, exert their rewarding and locomotor stimulant effects via increased dopamine (DA) transmission in the ventral striatum in rats. Additionally, recent evidence suggests that DA transmission importantly mediates the aversive effects of nicotine. The ventral striatum is not, however, a homogenous structure. Rather, anatomical and behavioural evidence suggests the presence of several discrete subregions. The most prominent of these are the core and medial shell regions of the nucleus accumbens, and the medial olfactory tubercle (OT). The objective of this thesis was therefore to examine the contribution of DAergic transmission in core, medial shell, and medial OT, to psychostimulant reward, locomotor stimulation and nicotine aversion. The first experimental chapter examined the effects of 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of core vs. medial shell on amphetamine-stimulated locomotion and conditioned place preference (CPP). Core, but not medial shell lesions attenuated locomotor stimulation. Conversely, medial shell but not core lesions reduced CPP magnitude. Medial shell lesions likely affected reward processing rather than memory, since similar lesions failed to reduce morphine CPP. Taken together, these findings suggested a segregation of reward and locomotor stimulation, but left open the possibility that conditioned and unconditioned effects of amphetamine were the critical factor. Accordingly, in Chapter 4, amphetamine-conditioned activity was abolished by core, but not medial shell lesions, suggesting that locomotor stimulation and reward processing, rather than conditioned vs. unconditioned drug effects, are segregated within the accumbens. Chapters 5-7 examined whether the apparent separation of CPP and locomotor stimulation generalized to the psychostimulants cocaine and methylphenidate, and to nicotine. Locomotion stimulated by cocaine or methylphenidate was reduced by core lesions. Lesion effects on CPP, however, were more complex. Medial shell lesions reduced both i.v. cocaine and nicotine CPP, without affecting CPP for i.p. cocaine or methylphenidate. Lesions of the medial OT effectively reduced both i.v. cocaine and methyphenidate CPP. Unexpectedly, core lesions increased i.v. nicotine CPP and tended to do the same to i.v. cocaine CPP. In the case of nicotine, this appeared to result from reduced nicotine aversion, since core lesions abolished nicotine-conditioned taste aversion. This work highlights the complex array of factors contributing to the behavioural sequelae of psychostimulant administration. Both the drug and route of administration appear to be important determinants of neurochemical and anatomical reward substrates. Such complexities must be considered in the search for more effective aids to reduce drug taking.</description><creator>Sellings, Laurie Heather Lynn.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Striatal mechanisms of psychomotor stimulant reward, locomotor activation and aversion</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Laurie Heather Lynn Sellings, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2f75rd13q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rn301562k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6w924g86c</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Obese individuals are at greater risk of various comorbidities including cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Endocrine imbalances and dyslipidemia are likely contributors to the etiology of these diseases in obese individuals. The objectives of this research project were: (1) to determine the effectiveness of a self-selected diet and exercise weight loss (WtL) protocol in overweight and obese women; (2) to investigate the effects of moderate WtL on hormones associated with the regulation of energy balance, blood lipid levels, and low density lipoprotein (LDL) particle size; (3) to characterize changes in cholesterol metabolism as a result of moderate WtL through an examination of factors that likely play a role in its modulation, specifically body composition and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in ATP binding cassette (ABC)G5 and ABCG8 transporter. In carrying out these objectives, 35 women were included in a 24-week WtL trial. Hormone, lipids, and cholesterol metabolism were assessed at the end of two stabilization periods. During these periods, body composition was also measured via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). WtL was achieved through a 20% decrease in energy intake using diet combined with a 10% increase in energy expenditure through physical activity. Overall, participants lost an average of 11.7+/-2.5 kg. WtL resulted in improvements in blood lipid risk factors of CVD with minimal effect on LDL particle size. No associations were found between leptin, ghrelin, adiponectin, and insulin. Cholesterol synthesis decreased as a result of WtL, while cholesterol absorption and turnover did not change. Despite an absence of change in turnover, increases were predicted by decreases in visceral adipose tissue, and decreases in cholesterol absorption were associated with losses in total and upper body skeletal muscle. This study also showed that changes in cholesterol concentrations and metabolism after WtL are associated with SNPs in ABCG5 and ABCG8 genes. These findings suggest that hormones important in the regulation of energy homeostasis may exert their effects independently. Moderate WtL results in cardioprotective changes in blood cholesterol levels primarily due to changes in cholesterol synthesis. These findings also indicate that the responsiveness of blood cholesterol levels and metabolism to weight loss is modulated by changes in body composition and SNPs in ABCG5 and ABCG8.</description><creator>Santosa, Sylvia.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Reducing diets.</subject><subject>Hyperlipidemia.</subject><subject>Lipids -- Metabolism.</subject><title>The effects of weight loss on cholesterol metabolism in overweight and obese hyperlipidemic women /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Sylvia Santosa, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j3860c04s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6w924g86c</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:d504rq49w</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The control of wheeled mobile robots is particularly challenging because of the presence of nonholonomic constraints. Modern two-wheeled mobile robot control is further complicated by the presence of one unstable equilibrium point, which requires a continuous stabilization of the intermediate body by means of sensors. In order to simplify the control of these systems, Quasimoro, a novel two-wheeled mobile robot, is proposed. The control of Quasimoro is simplified by means of its mechanical design. The robot is designed for quasiholonomy, a property that simplifies the control of nonoholonomic systems. To further simplify the control, the robot is designed so as to have a stable equilibrium point. A nonholonomic robotic mechanical system that can be rendered quasiholonomic by control is termed, in this thesis, quasiholonomic. This is the case of Quasimoro. This work proposes a model-based design methodology for wheeled mobile robots, intended to decrease the development costs, under which the prototype is built only when the system requirements are fully met. Following this methodology, the proposed robot is then designed and prototyped. The conceptual design of the robot is undertaken by means of a detailed analysis of the most suitable drive systems and their layout. The mathematical model of the robot is formulated in the framework of the Lagrange formalism, by resorting to the concept of holonomy matrix, while the controllability analysis is conducted using modern tools from geometric control. The embodiment design entails the simulation of three virtual prototypes aimed at further simplifying the robot control. To this end, a robot drive system, based on the use of a timing belt transmission and a bicycle wheel, is designed, calibrated and tested. Due to Quasimoro's drive system, the stabilization of the intermediate body, a well-known challenge in two-wheeled mobile robot control, is achieved without the use of additional mechanical stabilizers---such as casters---or of sensors---such as gyros. The intended application of the proposed robot is the augmentation of wheelchair users, a field that tremendously benefits from the cost-effectiveness and control simplification of the system at hand. For purposes of validation, a full-scale proof-of-concept prototype of the robot is realized. Moreover, the robot functionality is demonstrated by means of motion control experiments.</description><creator>Salerno, Alessio.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Engineering, Robotics.</subject><title>Design, dynamics and control of a fast two-wheeled quasiholonomic robot</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Alessio Salerno, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hh63t099c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d504rq49w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fb494d58c</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study addresses the phenomenon of elite Islamic schools in Indonesia by focusing on Al Azhar Islamic High School in Jakarta. Taking as its starting point the evolution and expansion of Islamic educational institutions in contemporary Indonesia, particularly since the 1970s, it examines the emergence of elite Islamic schools and identifies the unique characteristics that attract many urban, middle-class Muslims to send their children to these schools. In addition, this study attempts to address the lack of research on the history of Islamic education in Indonesia between the years 1970 and 2000. A review of past studies demonstrates that this period has not been critically examined enough. In looking at the specific example of Al Azhar Islamic High School, an evaluative case study and ethnographic techniques were employed. Interviews, observations, and fieldnotes served as primary resources. As the first elite Islamic school ever founded, it has distinguished itself as a pioneer in providing educational service especially to the urban Muslim society in Jakarta. My central research question was whether the changes that had occurred in the Islamic educational system following the introduction of elite or excellence-oriented schools had really lived up to expectations. More specifically, I inquired into the strengths and weaknesses of elite Islamic schools faced with the task of meeting ongoing and complex challenges in this era of globalization, while at the same time maintaining Islamic teachings and practices. However, this study found that there is still a gap between the ideals of the elite Islamic school and its ability to pursue its stated goals of education. The lack of human resources and poor communications between school community and government show that these schools have not yet achieved the highest quality standards. The study also reveals that the school has to adopt policies to promote transparency in the organizational and administrative spheres, openness to non-Muslims, and accessibility to other sections of society. This research makes a contribution to the fields of school reform and school effectiveness. Moreover, the study may also have implications for other social and religious contexts.</description><creator>Rifai, Nurlena.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Islamic education -- Indonesia -- Jakarta.</subject><title>The emergence of elite Islamic schools in contemporary Indonesia : a case study of Al Azhar Islamic school</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Nurlena Rifai, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j098zg255.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fb494d58c</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Curriculum and Instruction</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k930c246f</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The social implications of anxiety have received little empirical attention. Moreover, the continuity of interpersonal processes associated with clinical and non-clinical levels of chronic social anxiety has not been systematically investigated. The relation between interpersonal behavior and anxiety reported during naturally occurring social interactions was examined in two studies; the first examined community volunteers exhibiting a range of chronic social anxiety levels, while the second compared individuals with generalized social anxiety disorder (GSAD) to a matched sample of non-clinical controls. Unique patterns were expected to emerge with respect to state versus chronic levels of social anxiety. State social anxiety was conjectured to predict an alliance-protective response characterized by increased levels of agreeable behavior and decreased levels of quarrelsome behavior. Chronic social anxiety was hypothesized to predict a self-protective interpersonal style characterized by increased levels of submissive behavior and decreased levels of dominant behavior. Event-level appraisals of inferiority were expected to moderate this self-protective orientation; socially anxious individuals were expected to report enhanced levels of submission and reduced levels of dominance during interactions in which subjective inferiority was elevated. As predicted, increased state social anxiety was associated with decreased levels of quarrelsome behavior. Elevated state anxiety was also associated with increased levels of submissive behavior. This pattern was observed across all levels of chronic social anxiety, although participants with GSAD displayed an even greater tendency to increase submissiveness in response to state social anxiety compared to controls. As predicted, elevated levels of chronic social anxiety were associated with increased submissive behavior and decreased dominant behavior across all levels of state social anxiety. Subjective appraisals of inferiority enhanced levels of submission and reduced levels of dominance among socially anxious individuals. The results illustrated separate patterns of behavior for state and chronic social anxiety and were consistent with the proposition that situational elevations in social anxiety are associated with alliance-protective behavior strategies while chronic elevations are associated with a self-protective orientation that is amplified by sensitivity to negative social cues. The findings also supported the contention that social anxiety is a continuous construct associated with similar interpersonal processes across clinical and non-clinical populations.</description><creator>Russell, Jennifer J.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Anxiety -- Social aspects.</subject><title>Alliance-protective and self-protective behavior strategies as adaptive responses to social anxiety</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Jennifer J.

In the continuous case, it is well known that the corresponding Green's functions decay polynomially. However, an identical proof of this fact fails in the discrete case, since the constant energy surfaces of the discrete Laplacian are not convex. Two approaches are presented to turn around this problem. One consists of adapting the stationary phase method in order to treat non convex surfaces admitting kappa &gt; 0 non vanishing principal curvatures at each point; as suggested by Littman. The other consists of changing the discretization of the Laplacian, as suggested by Molchanov and Vainberg. The second part of the thesis concerns random Schrodinger operators of type Anderson on the d-dimensional lattice. Sufficient conditions are presented for such operators, H = Delta + V, to satisfy almost surely the following, remarkable spectral and scattering properties: (1) Outside spec(Delta), the spectrum of H is pure point with exponentially decaying eigenfunctions (so-called Anderson localization). Examples where the spectrum of H is equal to the whole real line are also exhibited, in which case the eigenvalues of H are in addition dense in R \spec(Delta); (2) Inside spec(Delta), the spectrum of H is purely absolutely continuous (so-called delocalization); (3) Inside spec(Delta), the wave operators between H and Delta exist and are complete. Such Anderson operators are exhibited for the first time in the literature. Using the estimate of the first, part of the thesis, the mentioned sufficient conditions appear to be sparseness conditions on the support of the potential.</description><creator>Poulin, Philippe.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Mathematics.</subject><title>Random SchrÜdinger operators of Anderson type with generalized Laplacians and sparse potentials</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Philippe Poulin, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wp988q02k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ft848v575</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:j3860c052</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The effect of perceptual load and target-flanker proximity on developmental patterns of filtering efficiency was examined among children 5-12 years and a group of adults. The participants were asked to respond to a centrally presented arrow surrounded by congruent or incongruent flanker arrows. Filtering was operationalized in terms of the flanker congruency effect (FCE) and measured as the response latency difference between trials with incongruent flankers versus trials with congruent flankers. Conditions varied with regard to target-flanker distances and levels of perceptual load. Developmental changes in susceptibility to the FCE did not appear to be related to target-flanker proximity, but were related to a perceptual load manipulation that involved varying the response associated with the target. The FCE was larger in magnitude for 7-10 year old children than for 11-12 year old children and adults under low perceptual load conditions. However, these developmental differences in susceptibility to the effects of interference were no longer apparent under high perceptual load conditions. This finding suggests differential developmental trajectories for filtering efficiency based on the processing demands involved in the task, and can be understood within the framework of the perceptual load model of selective attention.</description><creator>Porporino, Mafalda.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Visual perception.</subject><title>A developmental study on effective filtering : the role of flanker distance and perceptual load</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Mafalda Porporino, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5999n740n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j3860c052</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vt150p284</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Angiogenesis is a process of new blood vessel formation and is the culmination of both mitogenic and tissue remodeling events, resulting in neovascularization. It is a physiological process that is required for, amongst others, normal embryonic development, female reproductive function, and wound healing. Angiogenesis is a tightly regulated process which is balanced by both positive and negative factors. However, in many disease states, including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, rheumatoid arthritis, and several cancers, dysregulation of angiogenesis contributes to disease progression. Previous published reports have implicated the coordinated activities of at least two families of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and the Tie receptor families, in this process. Tie2, an endothelial-specific receptor tyrosine kinase, plays an essential role in normal blood vessel maturation, remodeling, and stability. Tie2 expression is also upregulated in various cancers indicating a role in tumor angiogenesis. The human Tie2 mRNA transcript contains an unusually long (372 nucleotides) 5' untranslated region (UTR) with five upstream open reading frames (uORFs). In this thesis, we demonstrate that the Tie2 5' UTR promotes cap-independent translation, indicating the presence of functional internal ribosome entry site (IRES). In addition, we illustrate that Tie2 IRES activity is maintained, and even slightly stimulated, under hypoxic conditions when cap-dependent protein synthesis is attenuated. We further show that the Tie2 IRES is functional during quiescence, another condition known to compromise cap-dependent translation. These results present how Tie2 mRNA is translated despite a cumbersome structured 5' UTR and how its production is secured under unfavorable environmental conditions. We define experimental conditions where the Tie2 IRES is not active, allowing us to assess the contribution of cap-dependent translation to Tie2 protein synthesis. We demonstrate evidence that Tie2 mRNA can be translated via both cap-dependent scanning mechanism and internal initiation. Moreover, we show that the presence of the uORFs within the 5' UTR is inhibitory to downstream translation initiation. Our results suggest that the uORFs serve to decrease the proportion of ribosomes competent for reinitiation as they traverse the mRNA 5' UTR and thus minimizing interference with the IRES and/or mediating inefficient translation of the potent protein under normal conditions. Like many other cellular IRESes, the entire Tie2 5' UTR appears to be required for maximum IRES activity. Taken together, our results underscore the complex mechanisms to control gene expression at the level of translation initiation of the Tie2 mRNA.</description><creator>Park, Eun-Hee, 1971-</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Mechanisms of translation initiation of receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Eun-Hee Park, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1j92gc42j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vt150p284</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:02871127q</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Although available evidence suggests that NTS1 receptors play a key role in the transduction of many of the central effects of neurotensin (NT), recent data indicate that the NTS2 subtype may be responsible for mediating NT-induced analgesia. However, little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying NTS2 function. It is also unclear whether endogenous NT is an agonist at the NTS2 site and to which second messenger system(s) this receptor is coupled since conflicting data has emerged from studies carried out in systems heterologously expressing the NTS2 receptor. In this context, the overall objective of the present study was to characterize the distribution of the NTS2 protein in rat brain, to further document the role played by NTS2 receptors in antinociception, and to unravel the cellular mechanisms underlying NTS2-mediated transduction of NT's effects. Our immunohistochemical studies revealed that NTS2 receptors are widely expressed within the rat CNS with high densities of labeled neurons and/or processes in descending antinociceptive pathways including the periaqueductal gray (PAG), and the rostroventral medial medulla. Both the full-length and alternatively-spliced isoforms induced a rapid and sustained activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2) pathway in both transfected CHO and COS-7 cells upon stimulation with NT. Combined biochemical and confocal microscopic studies revealed that NTS2 receptors were maintained at the cell surface following long-term agonist exposure despite efficient internalization mechanisms. This preservation was neither due to NTS2 neosynthesis nor recycling but rather appeared to involve translocation of spare receptors from intracellular stores as observed in both transfected cells and rat spinal cord neurons. NTS2 was demonstrated to heterodimerize with NTS1 in cells co-transfected with the two receptors. This heterodimerization was found to affect cell surface recruitment of NTS1, making it more similar to that of NTS2. Also, upon prolonged NT stimulation, cell surface NTS1 were more resistant to down-regulation in cells co-expressing NTS1 and NTS2 than in cells expressing NTS1 alone. Such maintenance of NT receptors bioavailability might prove of great importance for the use of NTS2-selective agonists for the treatment of chronic pain.</description><creator>Perron, Amélie.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>NTS2 neurotensin receptors : distribution, interactions, and cellular dynamics in model systems and rat brain</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Amélie Perron, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vh53x1159.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/02871127q</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4j03d4091</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Vulvar vestibulitis syndrome is believed to be the most common form of premenopausal dyspareunia and represents an excellent candidate in which to investigate the interaction of cognitive, affective, and physiological factors. The first empirical investigation in this thesis explored pain information processing in a group of 17 women suffering from vulvar vestibulitis syndrome and an equal number of age-matched controls. Women with vulvar vestibulitis reported greater hypervigilance for coital pain, and also exhibited a selective attentional bias towards pain stimuli on an emotional Stroop task. The second empirical investigation sought to explore the implications of hypervigilance for pain during sex on sexual arousal and subsequent sensory processing in this same clinical population. Twenty women suffering from vulvar vestibulitis syndrome and an equal number of age-matched control participants underwent genital and non-genital sensory testing in response to erotic and neutral stimulus films. In response to the erotic stimulus, both groups evidenced an increase in physiological sexual arousal and genital sensitivity, however, women with vulvar vestibulitis reported lower levels of mental sexual arousal. In addition, women with vulvar vestibulitis evidenced greater genital and non-genital sensitivity as compared with healthy participants across all conditions. Two literature reviews are also included to examine the classification, diagnosis, and treatment of vulvar vestibulitis syndrome. A final methodological paper is included in order to provide a historical review and technical guide for the labial thermistor clip, a measure of physiological sexual arousal in women which was revived and refined for use in the second study. Taken together, this body of work illustrates the complex interactions between the pain and sexual processing systems implicated in vulvar vestibulitis syndrome.</description><creator>Payne, Kimberley A.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Dyspareunia.</subject><title>Dimensions of pain and sex in vulvar vestibulitis syndrome</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Kimberley A.

However, during melting and casting processes, significant amounts of magnesium are lost due to selective oxidation. Preventing these losses would reduce the production cost and improve the quality of the final product. The effects of various levels of strontium addition on the oxidation behaviour of aluminum-magnesium alloy melts were investigated by monitoring sample weight gains with time using a thermogravimetric balance at 750°C. Sample cross-sections have been examined in detail using Hitachi S-4700 Field Emission Gun Scanning Electron Microscope, and phases formed on the oxide layer and in the alloy morphology were identified by EDS, WDS and low angle X-ray diffraction techniques. It was observed that in the absence of Sr, the Al-Mg samples gained substantial amounts of weight by formation of spinel (MgAl2O4) phase at the oxide-metal interface. Samples containing Sr had significantly lower weight gains. The drop in total weight gain by Sr additions was about 98% in low Mg-containing Al-Mg alloys. This change in oxidation behavior was linked to the presence of a Sr-enriched liquid phase underneath the first formed MgO layer, suppressing the formation of spinel crystals. In addition, spherical equilibrium shapes are found in the different as-cast and oxidized alloys of Al-Mg-Sr.</description><creator>Ozdemir, Ozgur.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</subject><title>Effect of strontium on the oxidation behavior of molten aluminum-magnesium alloys</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Ozgur Ozdemir, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dv13zz32j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9s161b444</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:000004277</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Enzymes are increasingly applied to organic synthesis because of their high enantioselectivity, chemoselectivity, and environmental friendliness. Hydrolytic enzymes are the largest class used for biotransformations, and subtilisin is one of the commonly used serine proteases for organic synthesis. We hypothesized that we could expand the usefulness of subtilisin to hydrolyze unnatural substrates. The X-ray crystal structure of subtilisin shows that it has a large open active site. Previous workers focused on hydrolysis of natural substrates and close analogs, but the open active site suggests that subtilisin should accept bulky substrates that do not resemble peptides. The Diels-Alder reaction is important in organic synthesis because it has the potential to create several stereocenters in a single step. We resolved a bulky secondary alcohol ester of a spiro chiral auxiliary for the Diels-Alder reaction on a gram scale using subtilisin Carlsberg. The reaction proceeded with high enantioselectivity and yield. Cholesterol esterase showed high enantioselectivity but with the opposite enantiopreference, consistent with mirror image arrangement for the active sites of subtilisins and lipases/esterases. We also used molecular modeling to identify the molecular basis of enantioselectivity of subtilisin Carlsberg toward this secondary alcohol. Resolution of tertiary alcohol esters is difficult because they are also very bulky, but important because there are only a few synthetic and biocatalytic methods to prepare enantiopure tertiary alcohols. We discovered several proteases that hydrolyze esters of tertiary alcohols, one of which was subtilisin Carlsberg. This is the first examination of protease hydrolysis of tertiary alcohol esters. Substrate studies and molecular modeling explained their reactivity and enantioselectivity. Sulfinamidies are also bulky substrates, but surprisingly subtilisin catalyzed a catalytic promiscuous reaction of N-acyl sulfinamides. Subtilisin Carlsberg-catalyzed hydrolysis of N-acyl sulfinamides favored cleavage of the sulfinamide (S(O)-N) bond with a minor amount of the expected carboxamide (C(O)-N) bond. The sulfinamide hydrolysis was enantioselective and confirmed by product isolation from the S-N sulfinamide cleavage. In contrast, the related subtilisins BPN' and E favored the C-N carboxamide hydrolysis. Further examination using electrospray-mass spectrometry revealed a sulfinyl-enzyme intermediate located at the active site, analogous to an acyl-enzyme. This suggested an analogous mechanism to the amide/ester hydrolysis. Substrate variation indicated a substrate reversal was responsible for the change in reactivity by binding in the S1 acyl pocket. Three mutations of subtilisin BPN' towards subtilisin Carlsberg increased the S-N hydrolysis by 14-fold, indicating that only a few mutations were responsible for the catalytic promiscuity. The substrate specificity and mutagenesis were consistent with a reversed orientation for the sulfinyl hydrolysis reactions. The active site of subtilisin is indeed versatile for unnatural substrates and unnatural reactions. We expanded the applications of subtilisin to resolve bulky substrates, such as chiral auxiliaries and tertiary alcohol esters, and also to perform a new catalytic promiscuous sulfinamide S-N bond hydrolysis. Based on these results, subtilisin should prove useful for future resolutions of bulky substrates, and also in catalytic promiscuous reactions where unusual reactive centers are hydrolyzed.</description><creator>Mugford, Paul F.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Chemistry, Organic.</subject><title>Expanding hydrolase catalyzed reactions to new substrates and reactions : subtilisin catalyzed hydrolysis of sulfinamides and sterically hindered substrates</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Paul F.

The goal is to study the dynamical behaviour of this system from a nonlinear point of view, both theoretically and experimentally. A weakly nonlinear model is derived assuming that the cylinder centreline is extensible. Nonlinear Euler-Bernoulli beam theory is used for the structure and, the fluid forces acting on the cylinder are assumed to be inviscid, frictional and hydrostatic ones. The derivation of the equations of motion is carried out in a Lagrangian framework, and the resultant equations are correct to third order of magnitude. These nonlinear partial differential equations are then recast in nondimensional form and discretized by using Galerkin's technique, giving a set of nonlinear second-order ordinary differential equations. Houbolt's finite difference method and AUTO are used as two numerical methods to solve the resulting set of ordinary differential equations. The centre manifold reduction method is also used as an analytical method to study the behaviour of the system in the vicinity of the pitchfork bifurcation point. The results for a cylinder with various boundary conditions are presented in the form of bifurcation diagrams with flow velocity as the independent variable, supported by time histories, phase-plane plots, PSD plots and Poincare maps. The influence of different parameters on the behaviour of the system is also investigated. Three series of experiments were conducted on vertical clamped-clamped cylinders. In the first series of experiments, the downstream end of the clamped-clamped cylinder was free to slide axially, while in the second series of experiments, the downstream end was fixed. The influence of externally applied axial compression has also been studied in the second series of experiments. In the third series of experiments, a more flexible cylinder was used, and the effect of externally applied axial compression on the dynamic instability of the cylinder was also studied.</description><creator>Modarres-Sadeghi, Yahya.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Nonlinear dynamics of a slender flexible cylinder subjected to axial flow</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Yahya Modarres-Sadeghi, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k0698c95n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h989r744h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5m60qw99p</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Noncontact atomic force microscopy (NC-AFM) was applied to investigating the creation of monatomic depth rectangular pits, the growth of metals, and the templated growth of molecules on the KBr (001) surface under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. The pits were produced by a new method where the sample is exposed to a controlled dose of charge from an electron beam evaporator. The structure and size distribution of the pits was characterized by NC-AFM. For the metal growth studies, gold, tantalum, and palladium were deposited onto KBr by electron beam deposition. The gold produced tall multiply twinned and epitaxial nanoparticles, while the tantalum formed flatter fractal islands. The palladium growth resulted in the creation of rectangular KBr islands in addition to palladium nanoparticles. Despite the use of a charge deviating grid, charge played an important role during the metal growth. In particular, the number density of gold nanoparticles followed nearly the same temperature dependence as the pits, suggesting that the metal nanoparticles nucleate predominantly at defect sites created by incident charge. The effect of charge was also seen in the tantalum system where pits surrounded the nanoparticles prepared at elevated temperatures. By creating pits before depositing gold, it was shown that the pits edges can be used to template the growth of metals. It was also shown that the pits can be used to trap PTCDA molecules and to align C60 molecules with the &lt;100&gt; direction of the substrate. Molecular resolution NC-AFM measurements were used to determine the structures and lattice constants of the molecular nanostructures. Experiments involving the sequential growth of metals and molecules showed that the order of deposition and the strength of the molecule-metal interaction are key factors in determining the nature of the growth. Furthermore, it was shown that metal structures can be used to nucleate the growth of sufficiently strongly interacting molecules.</description><creator>Mativetsky, Jeffrey M.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Physics, Condensed Matter.</subject><title>Understanding and controlling the growth of metals and molecules on an insulating surface</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Jeffrey M.

This study compared the patterns of relational communication when different processes (i.e., decision-making versus information gathering) are used to meet the objectives of CBC during the Conjoint Problem Identification Interview (CPII) and the Conjoint Problem Analysis Interview (CPAI). It also explored the relationship between patterns of relational communication and the outcome of CBC. Twenty-one children with identified behavioral problems (ages 3 to 8), the mothers and teachers of these children (i.e., the consultees), and advanced graduate students (i.e., the consultants) participated in this study. Relational communication was measured via the Family Relational Communication Control Coding System (FRCCCS, Heatherington &amp; Friedlander, 1987). The two summary variables that were derived from the FRCCCS are domineeringness and dominance (Courtright, Millar, &amp; Rogers-Millar, 1979; Rogers-Millar &amp; Millar, 1979).The measure of outcome was the improvements in children's target behavior from baseline to intervention at home and at school, as measured by effect size statistics. The extent to which consultants, parents and teachers intent to direct the other and how the others receive their directiveness, appear to vary as a function of the interview as well as the process use to meet objectives within an interview. Some patterns of relational communication were found to be associated with the outcome of consultation. The original contributions as well as the implications of this research are discussed.</description><creator>Martel, Chantal A.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Behavioral assessment of children.</subject><subject>Mental health consultation.</subject><subject>Communication in psychology.</subject><title>Patterns of relational communication in conjoint behavioral consultation and their relationships with outcomes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Chantal A.

The two primary objectives associated with this work were to systematically study: (i) the Reynolds number dependence, and (ii) the radial distribution of differential diffusion in the jet. These goals were simultaneously achieved, along with several secondary objectives, such as determining the scales at which differential diffusion is manifested and examining the effect of background turbulence on differential diffusion. Experiments were performed in a momentum-driven, axisymmetric turbulent water jet, containing two passive scalars (fluorescent dyes) with differing molecular diffusivities (D). The jet issued into either a quiescent background or an approximately homogeneous, isotropic turbulent background. To determine the Reynolds number dependence, tests were conducted at five jet Reynolds numbers, ranging from Re = 900 to Re = 10600. (Re = u 0d/v, where u0 is the jet exit velocity, d is the jet exit diameter, and v is the kinematic viscosity.) Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) was employed to obtain instantaneous individual species concentrations at a downstream location, located in the self-similar region. At each Reynolds number, measurements were acquired at radial positions extending from the jet centreline to its edges. The normalized concentration difference, Z, was defined to elucidate differential diffusion effects. Statistics of this parameter revealed the magnitude of differential diffusion at each Reynolds number and radial location. In particular, the root-mean square of the normalized concentration difference, Z rms, gave an indication of the intensity of these effects. Centreline results showed that differential diffusion effects slowly decay with increasing Reynolds number, scaling as Zrms ∝ Re-0.09. Even though the effects were decreasing, they were still non-zero at the highest Reynolds number studied (Zrms = 0.064 at the centreline at Re = 10600). Differential diffusion effects were also shown to increase (i) with increased radial position from the centreline, and (ii) in the presence of a turbulent background. These two instances, along with the increased differential diffusion at lower Reynolds numbers, support the hypothesis of an increase of differential diffusion effects as the occurrences of interfaces between dyed jet fluid and entrained ambient fluid increases. Also presented are the first experimental measurements of the spectrum of the normalized concentration difference, EZ(K1 eta). These revealed the scales at which differential diffusion manifests itself. In all instances, these spectra were observed to decrease with wavenumber over all wavenumbers, consistent with a flow dominated by the decay of its scalar field. Although differential diffusion effects are molecular in origin, they persist at scales larger than the Kolmogorov scale.</description><creator>Lavertu, Thomas Michael.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Differential diffusion in a turbulent jet</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Thomas Michael Lavertu, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mw22v9843.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h702qb60d</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:j3860c06b</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Hydraulic and morpho-sedimentary differences between pools and riffles have always intrigued fluvial geomorphologists. Surprisingly, earlier explanations of pool-riffle morpho-sedimentology dynamic focus too exclusively on hydraulic patterns and neglect analysis of sediment transport. Understanding the mechanisms governing pool-riffle morpho-sedimentary dynamics, such as the sediment transport patterns represent a big challenge in fluvial geomorphology, considering the stochastic nature of bedload transport in gravel-bed rivers. The main objective of this thesis is to understand the two-dimensional relationship between hydraulic patterns, sediment transport patterns and morpho-sedimentary changes in pool-riffle sequences and to use these insights to understand how pool-riffle sequences maintain their form over time. This thesis is organized into four chapters. These chapters analyze hydraulic, sediment transport and morpho-sedimentary measurements collected on a riffle-pool-riffle sequence of the Des Coeurs river during seven controlled experimental floods. Chapter 2 tests the velocity reversal hypothesis (Keller, 1971), with results demonstrating that no velocity reversal was observed in the field, for peak flow up to 123% of the bankfull discharge. Chapter 3 demonstrates the existence of a bedload transport reversal: below 60% of bankfull discharge, sediment transport on the riffle exceeds transport in the pool; as discharge increased, more sediment was exported from the pool than imported, thereby maintaining the pool. Chapter 4 demonstrates that the bedload transport reversal is caused by the spatial heterogeneity of the sediment transport patterns (sediment supply, particle displacements and sediment sorting), which underlies the importance of developing two-dimensional bedload transport formulae. Chapter 5 tests the two-dimensional applicability of well-known bedload transport formulae developed in a one-dimensional environment. None of the formulae could be applied with accuracy in a two-dimensional environment. However, site-specific calibration considerably improves bedload transport rate and grain-size distribution prediction. This thesis improves the understanding of the morpho-sedimentary dynamics of pool-riffle sequence; it argues that a purely hydraulic view of pool-riffle sequence is insufficient to understand their stability. It explains pool-riffle maintenance as a result of a bedload transport reversal caused by the spatial heterogeneity of the sediment transport patterns, and raises the importance of acquiring two-dimensional sediment transport data to improve two-dimensional bedload transport formulae.</description><creator>Latulippe, Christian.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Sediment transport -- Québec (Province) -- Des Coeurs River.</subject><title>Morpho-sedimentary dynamics of pool-riffle sequences in a gravel-bed river : bedload transport reversal and pool-riffle maintenance</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Christian Latulippe, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2r36v271d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j3860c06b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:c534fs890</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Background. Hospitalized infants still experience pain from regularly performed tissue-damaging procedures. Nurses have knowledge to manage the pain but do not apply that knowledge. There is agreement that hospital organizational factors influence quality of care outcomes and some indication that patient factors may influence level of care. Objective. This study examined the factors from a conceptual model entitled Knowledge Use for Pain Care. These were (1) nurse, (2) organizational and (3) infant factors in relation to nurses' management of tissue-damaging procedures in hospitalized infants. Research design. A prospective study using two neonatal intensive care units in two Canadian provinces in 2005 was used. Participants. Ninety-three nurses who performed 170 tissue-damaging procedures. Measures. Nurse demographic data included education, and years of experience. Nurses' knowledge of pain was measured using the new Pain Knowledge and Use instrument. Organizational factors were measured using the nurse-doctor Collaboration and Satisfaction about Care Decisions Scale (Baggs, 1994), and the Environmental Complexity Scale (O'Brien, Irvine, Peereboom &amp; Murray, 1997). Infant factors included age and intensity of care required. Actual pain care was measured by a scorecard of nurses' assessment, management and documentation for the tissue-damaging procedure. Estimates of professional nurse, organizational and infant effects on nurses' pain care for the tissue-damaging procedures were derived from general estimating equations. Results. Higher procedural pain care was associated with higher nurse doctor collaboration (odds ratio {OR}, 1.44; 95% confidence intervals {CI} 1.05-1.98), infants with higher intensity of care (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.06-1.39), unanticipated increases in the work of nurse assignments (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.04-2.30). Nurse's level of pain knowledge was adequate but did not translate into actual care for tissue-damaging procedures. Conclusion. The results suggest that the model was partly supported. In particular the importance of nurse-physician collaboration in pain care delivery, a variable amenable to intervention and further study was significant. Overall, the factors that influence nurse's use of their pain knowledge to provide better care remain a complex issue.</description><creator>Latimer, Margot.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Health Sciences, Nursing.</subject><title>The examination of nurse, organizational and infant factors associated with effective procedural pain care in hospitalized infants /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Margot Latimer, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6d570171p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fs890</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Nursing</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gb19fb209</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Objective. The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of antenatal mebendazole plus iron supplementation versus placebo plus iron supplementation on birthweight in a highly hookworm-endemic area. Methods. This study was a double-blind randomized controlled trial set in rural and peri-urban communities in the Peruvian Amazon region. A total of 1042 second trimester pregnant women between the ages of 18 and 44 years were recruited from April to November 2003, and followed to July 2004. Women were randomly assigned to receive either mebendazole (500 mg single dose) plus iron supplements (60 mg elemental iron daily) or placebo plus iron supplements. The primary outcome was mean infant birthweight and secondary measures included proportion of low birthweight (&lt;2500g) and maternal anemia. Adverse birth outcomes were also recorded. Results. The prevalence of hookworm infection was 47.5%. There were no differences between intervention groups in mean birthweight (3104 g vs 3090 g, p=0.629), proportion of low birthweight (8.1% vs 8.7%, p=0.755) or maternal anemia in the 3rd trimester (33.0% (158/479) vs 32.3% (152/471), p=0.815). However, the proportion of very low birthweight (&lt;1500g) was significantly lower in the mebendazole group (0% (0/479) vs 1.5% (7/471), p=0.007). No statistically significant difference (p=0.664) in adverse birth outcomes (miscarriages, malformations, stillbirths, early neonatal deaths and premature babies) was found between the mebendazole group and the placebo group (28 versus 31, respectively). Conclusion. This trial provides additional evidence for the use of anthelminthics, over and above iron supplementation, within antenatal care programs in hookworm-endemic areas.</description><creator>Larocque, Renée, 1975-</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</subject><title>Randomized controlled trial of mebendazole plus iron supplement versus placebo plus iron supplementation during pregnancy</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Renée Larocque, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z890rz796.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gb19fb209</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:w9505475s</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The overview of the history of quantitative x-ray microanalysis shows the efficiency of the use of standards to achieve the most reliable quantification. State-of-the-art cold field emission gun scanning electron microscopes offer excellent resolution but lack a sufficient level of beam current stability essential for reliable quantitative microanalysis. The purpose of this work is to develop a new method for quantitative x-ray microanalysis adapted to unstable beam current conditions. In the Cliff and Lorimer method, which was developed for the analytical transmission electron microscope, the composition was calculated from the ratio of the characteristic x-ray intensities of two elements in the same spectrum. In this work, this ratio method is applied to bulk specimens in a scanning electron microscope (SEM). In order to reduce the amplitude of error propagation, the proposed ratio for SEM quantitative microanalysis is the intensity of a x-ray divided by the sum of intensities of one or more characteristic lines of each of tire elements found in the specimen. Moreover, the calculated x-ray intensities are corrected for the effects of absorption, fluorescence and Coster-Kronig yields, and other physical factors normally considered in microbeam analysis. Uncertainties in physical parameters and models, clue to the lack of exhaustive measurements as well as their scattering, revealed by a disaggrement between the measured and calculated ratios, are minimized by the use of a calibration factor inserted into the ratio. This calibration factor is determined using a standard for a given element. It can be used as often as needed and allows for the correction of uncertainties in the x-ray detector efficiency. In order to quantify the specimen, the measured experimental ratio is compared to a simulated ratio with the appropriate calibration factor. The composition is interpolated from the theoretical ratio curves. Two methods of calculation of emitted x-ray intensity are proposed, by analytical calculations using the Pouchou and Pichoir model or by an in-house developed Monte Carlo simulation program. Two sets of National Bureau of Standards (NBS) microanalysis standard reference materials, AuCu (SRM 482) and AuAg (SRM 481), are used to validate this method. The comparison of calculated composition with the nominal one underlines the need for a beam-energy-dependent calibration factor, particularly because of ionization cross-section uncertainties. The use of high energy characteristic x-ray lines (above 5 keV) permits accuracy around 3% with a beam-energy-dependent calibration factor. The effects of beam energy, ionization cross-section models, mass-absorption coefficients and x-ray generation methods are compensated by the appropriate calibration factor. The change of the family of characteristic lines affects the accuracy. Finally, as in any quantitative microanalysis, the use of a filter to extract the characteristic intensity causes errors for low energy peaks. The analysis of the effect of calibration factors and mass-absorption coefficient enhances the need for refining the x-ray generation and emission parameters. The error propagation is less important than if using the classical Cliff and Lorimer method in a SEM. However, the use of appropriate calibration factors and pair of lines offers promising accuracy in almost any conditions. This method is independent of the beam current, which is the purpose of this work. Despite many uncertainties of physical parameters, this method offers an efficient and reliable alternative to quantitative x-ray microanalysis with any electron microscope. Although developed for a binary material, the method can be extended to heterogeneous, rough, multiple-component materials, inasmuch as it can be simulated with a Monte Carlo program or any other method that computes characteristic x-ray lines intensities.</description><creator>Horny, Paula.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Engineering, Materials Science.</subject><title>Development of a quantification method for x-ray microanalysis with an electron microscope</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Paula Horny, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2j62s900w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w9505475s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):42000</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
