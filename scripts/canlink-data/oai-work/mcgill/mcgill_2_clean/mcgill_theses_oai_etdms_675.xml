In order to achieve this, a comprehensive comparative study of other countries' bilateral air transport agreements is undertaken. This involves carrying out a detailed examination of, inter alia, the theoretical, doctrinal and institutional features of the said agreements in general, and a practical study of various concrete agreements. Macau's current and future political and legal status is outlined with special consideration being paid to the unique status of the Territory vis-a-vis Portugal and the People's Republic of China. Macau's recently created civil aviation structure is presented along with the Territory's trading policy in general and more specifically, the international air policy to be adopted. Finally, based on the above research, a proposal is presented, in the conclusion, for a standard bilateral air transport agreement which Macau can use in its expanding civil aviation links with other countries.</description><creator>Santos, Aurora C.

An adoption of the New York Convention, as well as the pro-enforcement attitude that it fosters, helps in creating a system for the facilitation of the enforcement of arbitral awards throughout the world. In Jordan, the benefits sought from adopting the Convention will not be realised unless the Convention's bias towards the enforcement of foreign awards is clearly understood and implemented in the courts' decisions. The autonomous nature of arbitration should make it possible for the Jordanian courts to apply a narrow interpretation of the Convention's grounds for non-enforcement; an approach which has already become a trend in cases decided under the Convention. Such a relaxed treatment of foreign awards has not, and should not, risk the procedural integrity of the arbitral process. This is so since the Convention provides for a safeguard of the enforcing state's most basic notions of public policy and due process.</description><creator>Obeidat, Sanaa A.</creator><contributor>Toope, Stephen J.

A root cause of many consumer problems is that the legal regime has institutionalized a predominantly economic conception of the relationship between consumers and the large corporation, governing both the internal management of the corporation, and the adjudicative process. Using sociological models, the thesis argues that consumers should be conceived as value-contemplators and that large corporations should be recast as consumer-oriented instruments of value production. Based on these conceptions, specific institutional reforms are suggested for rendering the corporate vehicle and the small claims court better suited to address consumer issues.</description><creator>McGuire, Seana</creator><contributor>Macdonald, Roderick A.

The present study is divided into four parts. The first part states the thesis itself, the goals, and the structure of the discussion. The second part provides the basic premises of the analysis, with emphasis on the current data on foreign investment in the three countries. The third part presents the core of the comparative study and deals with the following issues: basic foreign investment laws, including corporate laws, property rights of foreign persons, currency regimes. Among other important aspects, attention is paid to the following subjects: general treatment of FDI, foreign investment in corporate capital, branches of transnational corporations, forms of FDI, special procedures for banking and insurance, closed sectors for FDI, financing of investment, incentives of FDI, domestic and international guarantees for FDI etc. The set of criteria used to assess the compared legislation focuses primarily on the essential features of that legislation. This narrow approach is expedient in terms of the huge area that relates to foreign investment. The final part uses the findings of the comparative study of the relevant legislation in order to determine the reasons for the lagging interest of foreign investors in Bulgaria. These reasons are found not to be due to any deep-seated differences in the pertinent legislation, but rather to some other factors, such as historical, socio-cultural, and geopolitical. The law in the present work is stated as of 1 January 1994.

The traditional system, characterized by nationalism, protectionism, and bilateralism, which prevented true competition and protected national carriers, has broken up. The creation of a common air transport policy for the Community has important implications for relationships between Member States and third countries. The world airline industry is very much concerned by the emergence of a series of new principles and laws affecting the international air transport of third countries, such as the principle of non-discrimination, freedom of establishment, freedom of services, and EC competition law. Korea, which has fewer bargaining tools to attract the EC air carriers, must understand correctly the present changes in the air transport field of the EC and try to seek its own possible strategies.</description><creator>Maeng, Sung Kyu</creator><contributor>Janda, Richard A.

First, we will begin with an historical study of aboriginal rights, background for the framework of the James Bay Agreement. We will then focus our attention on the municipal regime of the Province of Quebec in an effort to subsequently evaluate its establishment in northern Quebec. Third, we will analyze the concept of landholding corporation as initiated at the time of the James Bay Agreement. Finally, we will take a look at the extensive repercussions as a result of the creation, organization and interaction of these two corporate entities in an aboriginal context.</description><creator>Lavallée, Stéphane</creator><contributor>Webber, Jeremy (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Political Science, Public Administration.</subject><subject>History, Canadian.</subject><subject>Law.</subject><title>Analyse des institutions municipales et foncières instituées par la Convention de la Baie James et du Nord québécois sur le territoire du Nunavik par Stéphane Lavallée.</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8049g703m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qz20sv841</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sn00b087p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:09:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis makes a proposal for a Greek policy in the area of television broadcasting aimed at ensuring the country's ability to maintain a distinctive position in the European broadcasting market while protecting and promoting Greece's culture and language. The first part of the thesis presents the evolution of Greek legislation on television broadcasting and the status of programming content and quality from 1966, when the first television programme schedule was transmitted, until the present day. The European Community's legal framework and, in particular, the "Television Without Frontiers" Directive is analyzed since any Greek broadcasting policy has to abide by Community law. Reference is also made to the Council of Europe's Convention on Transfrontier Television. Finally, it is suggested that a Greek television broadcasting policy should focus on the formulation of different mandates for the public and private broadcasters, on the reorganization and strengthening of the public broadcaster, on the increase and funding of national cultural broadcasts and Greek language audiovisual works (as defined in the thesis), as well as on high-quality and diversified programming.</description><creator>Kariofilli, Helen</creator><contributor>Janda, Richard (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Law.</subject><subject>Mass Communications.</subject><title>Television broadcasting and cultural sovereignty in Greece</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3197xn671.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sn00b087p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:w0892c865</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:09:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The various forms and manifestations of international and transnational criminality require a comprehensive approach by the international community from which effective strategies of prevention, control, and suppression can follow. This thesis argues that the establishment of an ICC in the 1990s, especially due to the end of the Cold War and recent wars in the Persian Gulf and in Bosnia and Herzegovina, would provide an effective means of dealing with international and transnational criminality, and, without deflecting domestic concentration on law enforcement, would be a complementary and incremental effort, which would enhance overall criminal justice enforcement. This study analyzes past efforts to establish an ICC, discusses arguments for and against the creation of an ICC, and addresses several questions concerning the implementation of the court, including questions related to state sovereignty and jurisdictional bases for an ICC, crimes within the court's jurisdiction, applicable substantive and procedural law, and practical concerns relating to the court's structure, composition, and facilities. Although an ICC admittedly would not be a perfect solution to problems of international criminality, the thesis advances the view that it must not be approached with a negative attitude, but rather with a view towards making more effective the benefits such a court would provide.</description><creator>Islami Someʾa, Reza</creator><contributor>Toope, Stephen J.

Moreover economic theory has allowed for a better understanding of the motivations and outcomes of this practice and has made possible a revision of the strict prohibition. This thesis first outlines the theories explaining the use of resale price maintenance. What emerges from these theories is that resale price maintenance is far from being an unequivocably deleterious form of conduct. Indeed, a manufacturer may seek to reach some results that are pro-competitive. Having outlined the arguments for and against the practice, an approach is proposed for detecting resale price maintenance that is likely to damage the consumers' interest. In fact, the problem arises only in cases of cartellization, or abuse of market power. The second part of the thesis is devoted to an analysis of four legislative regimes: those of the United States of America, Canada, Switzerland and the European Community. Three of these regimes include a strong prohibition against resale price maintenance, whereas the fourth, the Swiss cartel law, treats the practice as per se legal. Despite the diverging legal status reserved to this practice, the comparative law study will demonstrate first the consistency of an economic approach to each situation, and the weakness of the legal reasoning within this area. The analysis of these regimes serves to affirm the conclusions, that resale price maintenance constitutes a real danger only in the case where there is a cartel or abuse of market power. Since these cartel or abuse of market power abuse are themselves usually prohibited, the additional prohibition against resale price maintenance is redundant, and prevents some manufacturers from achieving possible pro-competitive results.</description><creator>Ibarrola, Jorge</creator><contributor>Janda, Richard (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Law.</subject><title>Les prix imposés de revente étude de droit comparé des Etats- Unis, du Canada, de la suisse et de la communauté européenne</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pr76f556w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0v8382542</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cz30pv66b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:09:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this study is to examine the issues relating to transboundary hazardous waste movements and the most recent efforts to address them at the international, regional and national levels. The transfer of hazardous wastes from the country of origin to other nations raises a number of environmental, ethical and economic concerns, particularly when developing nations are targeted as waste recipients. This work argues that the only appropriate response is the adoption of an ethical and preventive approach to the transboundary movement and management of hazardous waste. At the national level, prevention in the form of waste minimization and an integrated multi-media approach to hazardous waste management is essential to stem the tide of transboundary waste flows and to ensure environmental and human health protection. This work concludes with an examination of the necessity of a partial or global ban on transboundary waste movements and outlines new directions for sustainable development.</description><creator>Fortugno, Stefania A.

This thesis attempts to draw attention to the significance of the decision to justify humanitarian intervention in a certain way, and to some of the implications of that decision. The thesis compares the two justificatory options which seem to be most appropriate to the multilateralism of the post-Cold War era: collective humanitarian intervention under Chapter VII of the UN Charter and mulitilateral humanitarian intervention under customary international law. It reviews recent state practice, arguing that a mulitilateral right to intervene for the protection of human rights is emerging at custom. After critically analysing humanitarian intervention's justification under the Charter, the thesis concludes that the better way to justify the doctrine, both in principle and in practice, is under customary law.</description><creator>Ewing, Michelle.</creator><contributor>Toope, S.

These principles are: having the primary goal of creation and maintenance of long-term working relationships, accounting for the parties affected, addressing the whole dispute, building trust, and undertaking empathic dialogue. We can look at existing dispute resolution mechanisms and determine the extent to which the principles of cross-cultural dispute resolution can be incorporated, given the particular structure of a form of legal decision-making. Using the Yukon land claim negotiations as an example, the principles for cross-cultural dispute resolution can assist in the analysis of different processes. By using the principles as a basis for a dispute resolution mechanism, cross-cultural disputes can be more effectively resolved.

Yet, the question arises as to whether this system still constitutes a valid model. The scope of the present essay is then to examine the variant theoretical alternatives in their ability to liberalize such a conservative approach. In the light of the geopolitical cleavages of the end of the century, it seems that this system will survive, in spite of its numerous shortcomings and alleged obsolescence. Hence, it will have to be considered by any liberalizing trend, as it still is the better balanced compromise to cope with the growing interdependence of the international community.</description><creator>Andriotis, Dimitri</creator><date>1993</date><subject>Law.</subject><subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</subject><subject>Transportation.</subject><title>Commercial rights in International Air Transport and their regulatory regime on the eve of the twenty-first century : a diabolic issue?</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xd07gv63k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zw12z7372</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:db78tf03k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:09:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The normal lung with its air-filled alveoli is designed primarily to function in gas-exchange. Pulmonary edema, particularly in its alveolar flooding phase, is life-threatening because it interferes with this gas-exchange function. An important safety factor against alveolar flooding is the pulmonary interstitium that has a high compliance to accommodate edema fluid. We tested the hypothesis that if we decreased the compliance of the interstitium by experimental fibrosis, lung edema would be redistributed from the interstitium and predominantly flood alveoli. To study this, severe left lung fibrosis was produced in six dogs with radiation and bleomycin. Twenty-four months later, hydrostatic edema was induced by fluid infusion and lungs were studied pre- and post-edema with computed tomography (CT) scanning. Gravimetry and morphology were used to assess the amounts and distribution of edema between fibrotic left and control right lungs. Fibrosis, pre-edema, produced a 11-fold decrease in lung volume and a 2.2-fold increase in tissue density. We found, by CT and gravimetry, that similar amounts of water accumulated per unit volume in control and fibrotic lungs. Morphometry and semi-quantitative light microscopic grading showed a two-fold rise in the volume fractions of connective tissue and alveolar edema, and a 50% reduction of air and of interstitial edema in the fibrotic lobes. By electron microscopy, the interstitial edema in the fibrotic lungs was randomly distributed, whereas in the controls it was found primarily around extra-alveolar vessels and airways, not in the alveolo-capillary septa. We conclude that fibrosis profoundly affects the distribution of edema in the lung.</description><creator>Zwikler, Marvin Paul</creator><contributor>Michel, Rene P.

First, two SG gravity data sets from Cantley, Canada and Strasbourg, France are processed by following exactly the same steps. After we manually pre-process the recorded gravity, we perform a least squares procedure (HYCON package) to fit tides, atmospheric pressure and long term drifts. We obtain the gravity residuals and the corresponding power spectral density (PSD) using a Fast Fourier Transform. Subsequently a slew rate method is applied to automatically detect and correct the spikes and offsets in the Cantley data. A least squares procedure is again performed. The PSD of the gravity residuals show that there are no significant geophysical signals except harmonics of the daily atmospheric pressure in the sub-tidal frequency bands. In particular, we do not find evidence of the reported Slichter triplet. In order to fully exploit the various components of the gravity data and determine what factors affect the determination of the pressure admittances, tidal parameters ($ delta, kappa$) and signal levels, we have simulated the SG data by adding together of a synthetic tide, a brown noise, an actual atmospheric pressure record, a polynomial instrumental drift, artificial spikes and offsets, and a theoretical model for the Slichter triplet. The slew rate method and a more precise least squares procedure (ETERNA package) were applied to process the combined synthetic data. Using the PSD of the residual gravity signals in the sub-tidal bands, the theoretical Slichter triplet constructed in the data could be well recovered. Therefore we are confident the reported Slichter triplet should have been seen in our observed data.</description><creator>Xu, Hui, 1968-</creator><contributor>Crossley, David (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Geophysics.</subject><title>Analysis of high rate superconducting gravimeter data</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cj82k923p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/td96k467j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4j03d199k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:09:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Pea root plastids were isolated by differential centrifugation and resulting crude plastid fraction was purified by centrifugation through 10%(v/v) Percoll. Marker enzymes indicated that greater than 50% of the plastids were recovered essentially free from mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum contamination. The optimum in vitro conditions for glycerolipid biosynthesis from (U-$ sp{14}$C) glycerol-3-phosphate have been determined. Total glycerolipid biosynthesis was approximately 15 nmole/hr/mg protein in the presence of 200 $ mu$M glycerol-3-phosphate, 0.5 mM each of NADH and NADPH, 15 mM KH$ sb2$CO$ sb3$, 0.05 mM CoA, and 2 mM each of ATP and MgCl$ sb2$, 100 mM Bis Tris Propane (pH 7.5) and incubated at the standard temperature of 25$ sp circ$C. ATP, Coenzyme A and a divalent cation are absolutely required for glycerolipid biosynthesis, whereas reduced nucleotides and bicarbonate improve the synthesis to varying degrees. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate had little effect, while dithiothreitol, detergent and Mn$ sp{2+}$ inhibited activity. Under the optimum conditions, isolated pea root plastids mainly synthesized approximately 15% phosphatidic acid, 16% phosphatidylcholine, 13% phosphatidylglycerol, 32% triacylglycerol. Galactolipid synthesis occurred only when UDP-galactose was supplied. Different concentrations of some cofactors resulted in alterations of glycerolipid distribution. Phospholipase A$ sb2$ and Rhizopus lipase digestions of phospholipids and neutral lipids revealed that radioactive fatty acids were preferentially esterified to position sn 2 of each glycerolipid with generally 2-4 times as much radioactivity as position sn 1. Pea root plastids are composed of approximately 62% phospholipid, 24% neutral lipid and 14% glycolipid. Within these classes PG, TAG, and the galactolipids are the major components representing 24, 12, and 12% of the total plastid lipids.</description><creator>Xue, Lingru</creator><date>1993</date><subject>Plant lipids -- Synthesis.</subject><subject>Plastids -- Composition.</subject><subject>Peas -- Roots -- Physiology.</subject><title>Glycerolipid biosynthesis in pea root plastids</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g158bk17k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d199k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Plant Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7p88cj631</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:09:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis investigates the evolution of two secondary sexual characters in birds, large male body size and exaggerated male tail length. To determine whether the elaboration of these two characters is associated with two correlates of sexual selection intensity, mating system and parental care, I collected and examined morphological information for 1,990 species and natural history data for 745 species. Comparative studies should account for the problem of related species sharing similarities through common descent, so here I investigate associations with contrast scores that measure the variation radiating from unique ancestral nodes in a phylogeny. I show that greater polygyny correlates strongly with increasing male size but only slightly with longer male tail length, and that lesser paternal care correlates strongly with both traits. These results indicate that the evolution of increased male body size and exaggerated male tail length in birds is substantially influenced by the intensity of sexual selection.</description><creator>Winquist, Steven Todd</creator><contributor>Lemon, R.

The basic capitalization model is used as a starting point for the development of several models. These econometric models are then estimated, using data from four provinces: Quebec, New Brunswick, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. The time period studied is 1972 to 1991. The findings indicate that interest subsidies do in fact affect land values, however the effect is relatively small. There are large differences between provinces in terms of subsidy amount and consequently in terms of the effect of the subsidy programs on the value of land in each province.</description><creator>Williams, Sarah J.

Normal levels of CYC1 expression were restored when the mutants were supplemented with a heme analogue, suggesting that the mutations alter intracellular heme levels. Further analysis of WD revealed that it is also respiratory deficient. The mutations in these two strains are not complemented by any of the previously cloned heme biosynthetic genes. A clone was isolated from a yeast genomic library which confers both respiratory competence to WD and restores CYC1 expression in W24 to normal levels. DNA sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1179 base pairs coding for a protein of 393 amino acids which does not display significant homology to any other sequence in a database search. Disruption of the wild type gene, designated RHE1, elicits a respiratory deficient phenotype and does not result in heme auxotrophy. CYC1 expression in the disrupted strains is significantly reduced compared to the levels observed in W24. Analysis of the regulation of RHE1 expression revealed that this gene is transcriptionally repressed by growth in a non-fermentable carbon source and under heme-sufficient conditions.</description><creator>Weber, Sandra, 1969-</creator><contributor>Keng, Teresa (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Isolation of a gene required for respiration in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8k71nk160.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pr76f5575</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3197xn689</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:09:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Ca$ sb{x}$K$ sb{1-x}$(NO$ sb3) sb{1+x}$ glass system has been studied by means of X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The structure of the glass system was studied in XRD experiments and from the Radial Distribution Function (RDF). A structural model for this glass system was suggested with the agreement between the RDF calculation and structure model geometric calculation. DSC studies ranged from glass transition and crystallization to melting. The activation energy for crystallization was obtained. The difficulty of handling the glass in open air was overcome by using vacuum tube to melt the sample and glove box with Ar gas to handle the glass. It is found that the handling of the samples, i.e. avoiding exposure to moisture is critical to maintaining sample quality. For the structural studies, glasses of $ rm Ca sb{0.4}Na sb{0.6}(NO sb3) sb{1.4}, Ca sb{0.4}Rb sb{0.6}(NO sb3) sb{1.4}$ and $ rm Mg sb{0.4}K sb{0.6}(NO sb3) sb{1.4}$ were also prepared for comparison with the $ rm Ca sb{x}K sb{1-x}(NO sb3) sb{1+x}$ glasses. The same structural model applied to all of them with similar agreement. For the DSC studies, only the $ rm Ca sb{x}K sb{1-x}(NO sb3) sb{1+x}$ glasses were used. The relation between increase of glass transition temperature $T sb{g}$ and that of divalent cation concentration is linear. It was observed that unlike the metallic glass system, the crystallization activation energies do not change with the glass composition. We also observed the irreversible relaxation effect in this glass system and the effect of supercooling in the DSC to form the glass.</description><creator>Wang, Yan-Bin</creator><contributor>Ryan, D.

In order to analyze test data, it is necessary to estimate a special binary regression relation, called the item characteristic curve. The item characteristic curve is a relationship between the probabilities of examinees answering an item correctly and their abilities. The statistical tools used in this thesis are the generalized linear models and spline smoothing. The method tries to combine the advantages of both parametric modeling and nonparametric regression to get a good estimate of the item characteristic curve. A special basis for spline smoothing is proposed which is motivated by the properties of the item characteristic curve. Based on the estimate of the item characteristic curve by this method, a more stable estimate of the item information function can be generated. Some illustrative analysis of simulated data are presented. The results seem to indicate that this method does have the advantages of both parametric modeling and nonparametric regression: it is faster to compute and more flexible than the methods using parametric models, for example, the three-parameter model in psychometrics, and on the other hand, it generates more stable estimate of derivatives than the purely nonparametric regression.</description><creator>Wang, Xiaohui, 1969-</creator><contributor>Ramsey, T.

This study was conducted to determine to what extent genetic polymorphism exists in dairy cattle. Bovine plasminogen was first purified from Holstein cow plasma by affinity chromatography on Lysine-Sepharose and antibodies to bovine plasminogen were raised by monthly intramuscular injection of the isolated bovine plasminogen into rabbits. For plasminogen phenotyping, blood samples were collected at random from 50 Holstein and Ayrshire cattle, and plasminogen was isolated from the plasma using lysine-Sepharose and then treated with neuraminidase. After separation by isoelectric focusing (pH 3.5-9.5) in polyacrylamide gels, Plasminogen polymorphs were detected immunologically using rabbit anti-bovine plasminogen antibodies. Additionally, the plasminogen isoforms were evaluated with a functional assay (caseinolytic overlay technique) after activation of the plasminogen with urokinase. Six plasminogen phenotypes were identified which represent products of 5 variant alleles. The 5 plasminogen variants were characterized based on their isoelectric points and designated PLG A$ sb2$ (pI 6.5 and 7.0), B$ sb2$ (pI 7.6 and 7.8), C$ sb1$ (pI 6.8), D$ sb2$ (pI 7.8 and 8.0), and E$ sb2$ (pI 6.8 and 7.0). PLG A$ sb2$ and PLG B$ sb2$ were the most common variants in these cattle. The 6 phenotypes were $ rm A sb2A sb2, B sb2B sb2, A sb2B sb2, B sb2C sb1, A sb2D sb2 and D sb2E sb2$. The phenotypic frequencies in Holstein and Ayrshire were very different, $ rm A sb2A sb2 and B sb2B sb2$ being respectively the most frequent phenotype. In addition, DNA polymorphism at bovine plasminogen gene was detected when genomic DNA was digested with the restriction enzyme Msp I and hybridized with mouse plasminogen cDNA.

During one year 581 pairs of twins participated in the study. From each pair of twins, one was randomly allocated to receive vaccine and the other placebo as the first injection. At the second injection at least three weeks later, the situation was reversed. The parents recorded daily symptoms of both twins for 3 weeks after each injection. A vaccination associated increase in the symptoms occurred between 7 and 14 days after vaccination with a peak at 10 days after vaccination. Fever, especially moderate fever (38.5-39.4$ sp circ$C), was the most frequent symptom after MMR vaccination. Conjunctivitis, drowsiness and irritability also occurred among 1 year old children. Arthralgia was, on the other hand, the only symptom associated with the vaccination in the older children. The genetic component of vaccination complications is probably not important. A twin study is probably unnecessarily complicated in its statistical analysis and the "simple" random clinical trial is the method of choice.</description><creator>Virtanen, Martti, 1956-</creator><contributor>Carsley, John (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1991</date><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><subject>Biology, Biostatistics.</subject><title>Statistical analysis of a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover vaccination trial in twins : short term adverse reactions to measles-mumps- rubella vaccine</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/td96k4693.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8w32r7571</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):700</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
