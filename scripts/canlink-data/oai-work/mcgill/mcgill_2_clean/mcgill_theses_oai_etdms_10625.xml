There is evidence that raised intracranial pressure with patent subarachnoid pathways causes compression of the bridging segment.

One adaptation involved the mixture of thymus cells from mice of the graft-donor strain with PEC induced in the recipients. Small numbers of the thymus cells served as potent cellular antigens and demonstrated the immunological specificity of the assay, as revealed by inhibition of migration of the cell mixture. Thymus cells from a third-party strain sharing donor transplantation antigens caused similar inhibitions. In another approach, the addition of lymph node cells (LNC) from graft-immunized mice to PEC induced in the donor strain caused the inhibition of migration of the cell mixture in an immunologically specific fashion. Experiments showed that low numbers of LNC (1 to 2% of the population) were able to inhibit antigenic PEC demonstrating the sensitivity of this test and its applicability for the analysis of transplantation reactions at a cellular level.</description><creator>Lake, Philip</creator><contributor>Sehon, A.

The ability to transplant intestine would certainly find a useful place in the surgeons' armamentarium in treating a condition which requires excision of the entire small intestine. A morphological study of intestinal mucosal changes during rejection is presented in this thesis. The intestinal mucosa was found to reject in a fashion very similar to kidney and other organ allografts with the same general survival time. Clubbing, round cell infiltration and ischemic changes (lifting of the epithelium) are characteristic changes observed during rejection. Vascular damage and occlusion of the small vessels with platelet thrombi and fibrin deposition seem to have a significant role to play in the rejection process, as shown both in the carbon injection study and electron-microscopic studies presented. Immunosuppressive studies presented show that survival of intestinal allograft can be prolonged by conventional immunosuppressive agents (Anti-thymocytic-serum and immuran). However, it seems that intestine is more difficult to immunosuppress than kidney allografts. Donor graft perfusion with ATG during operation does not seem to have any appreciable effect ln the survival of intestinal allografts.</description><creator>Kwan, Alan H.</creator><contributor>Hinchey, E.

Two developmental processes were followed, maturation of reticulocytes in humans, rabbits and low-potassium sheep, and development of erythrocytes during ontogeny in LK lambs. Human and rabbit erythrocytes contain similar high potassium concentrations, though human membranes exhibit more alkali cation-dependent ATPase than rabbits. In both species, a decline in this activity is observed with cell maturation. LK sheep erythrocytes have low potassium content and little Na+-dependent ATPase. Reticulocytes possess elevated potassium levels and increased ATPase activity. Both parameters decrease during maturation, but the loss of ATPase activity is due mainly to a decrease in the Mg++-dependent component. LK lamb erythrocytes possess elevated potassium content and ATPase activity. Na+-ATPase resembles HK rather than LK erythrocytes, both in quantity and K+-response kinetics. Ontogeny is associated with changes in cell potassium levels and Na+-ATPase activity to mature LK characteristics.</description><creator>Kuebler, Evelyn S.</creator><contributor>Blostein, R.

Various classes of type A spermatogonia were identified on the basis of their nuclear morphology and topographical distribution along the tubular basement membrane. The data suggested that the isolated type A spermatogonia were generally non-proliferative and were possibly equivalent to the "reserve stem cells" postulated by Clermont and Bustos-Obregon (1968). Paired type A spermatogonia also appeared to belong to this class of cells. Type A1 spermatogonia, which formed linear groups of more than four cells, originated during the peak of mitosis of type A4 spermatogonia. The data indicated that the type A1 spermatogonia were produced by some type A4 cells and/or a variant of this type of cells showing an irregular lobed nucleus (A irregular). The remaining type A4 cells produced differentiated spermatogonia (Intermediate and type B) which generated spermatocytes. Type Al cells ae well ae type A2, A3 and A4, which derive from each other, thus constituted a class of "renewing stem cells".</description><creator>Hermo, Louis S.</creator><contributor>Clermont, Y.

Studies were performed to determine whether the GVH reaction itself could be altered by various cell treatments. GVH reactions were induced in adult CBA X A F1 mice by the injection of various doses of parental (A strain) lymphoid cells. Later the GVH animals received either an A strain thymus graft (PTG), CAF1 thymus graft (FITG) CAF1 bone marrow cells (SM)) CAF1 spleen graft (SG), F1TG and SM) F1TG and SG) or sham thymus graft (ST). At the higher cell doses it was found that F1TG by itself, or in combination with SM or SG shortened animal survival time. SM and SG treatment prolonged animal survival time. The results suggest that SM and SG protect F1 animals from the lethal effects of the GVH reaction, whereas F1TG increases the intensity of the GVH reaction.</description><creator>Grushka, Miriam</creator><contributor>Lapp, W.

At any given temperature, the addition of elastic loads resulted in a decrease in both tidal volume (VT) and respiratory frequency (f), the relationship between VT and f being given by: VT = m (f – fo), where m is a constant reflecting the vagal (lung volume-dependent) contribution to frequency, and fo ¬¬¬¬¬¬¬is the non-vagal (bulbo-pontine pacemaker) component. Indeed, following vagotomy, f was the same as the intercept fo determined at the same temperature. The log values of both fo and 1/m show a linear relationship to absolute rectal temperature on Arrenhius plots, providing average µ values of 33.8 and 33.0 Kcal/mole, respectively (corresponding to Q10 values of 6.1 and 6.0, respectively). Thus it appears that body temperature has the same effect on the contribution of both the vagal and bulbo-pontine pacemaker mechanisms controlling respiratory frequency.</description><creator>Grunstein, Michael M.</creator><contributor>Milic-Emili, J.

One group was given tap water, and the other 0.5% NaCl to drink after nephrectomy to enhance the changes produced by electrolyte derangements and to accelerate hypertension. In a third group, special permeability alterations were studied in rats treated similarly to group l (tap water only) , but subjected also to intravenous peroxidase tracer protein in order to document altered permeability in cardiac muscle cells.</description><creator>Eu, Hui-Young</creator><contributor>Rona, G.

To analyze the significance of grains over cells, 10 µCi per gram body weight of Na 125I was given intravenously into adult male rats which were sacrificed in 30-45 seconds by perfusing with glutaraldehyde; over 700 photographs of EM radioautographs were examined. Quantitative studies (by drawing appropriate boundary circles about each grain to locate the probable source of radioactivity) showed that of 7736 silver grains surveyed, 85-87% were over follicie lumens (the peak being adjacent to the apical cell membrane) and 13-15% were over follicular cell cytoplasm (again, the peak being adjacent to the apical cell membrane).</description><creator>Chajut, Norbert R.</creator><contributor>Nadler, N.

Bio-Gel A-1.5 M gave a reproducible elution profile consisting of 5 fractions, designated l -&gt; V. The physicochemical properties and degree of heterogeneity of the fractions were studied in dissociating and/or non dissociating solvents by the following methods: ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, sedimentation velocity, high-speed meniscus depletion sedimentation equilibrium, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immuno-diffusion, determination of spectral quantities, amino acid analysis and sulfhydryl group estimation. Comparison of the data with the literature suggestion that Fractions I, II and III, IV, and V were a-, β-, βs- and γ-crystallin respectively. Preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.1% Triton X-100 of Fraction Il, an intermediate molecular weight fraction, yielded three bands, designated P, Q and R, which were recovered from the gel. Subfractions P and Q were initially stable, forming aggregates that precipitated. Over 90% of the insoluble material could be solubilized in 8 M urea, 0.01% dithiothreitol.

This state of cell-mediated immunity was found to correlate with a reduce capacity of the spleen cells taken from such animals three days after priming to produce anti-sheep erythrocyte antibody in vitro. Evidence presented suggested that the depression is due to a competition between the cell mediated and humoral responses for the same thymus-derived lymphocyte. Thymus-derived lymphocytes perform a helper function in the synthesis of anti-sheep erythrocyte antibodies in mice. The helper cell could be replaced by a cell-free supernatant derived from short term culture of the thymus-derived cells with the antigen. This supernatant "factor" was shown to be heat labile, non-dialysable and immunologically specific. This finding suggested that direct cell-to-cell contact is not required in the cell co-operation in the anti-sheep erythrocyte antibody synthesis in mice.</description><creator>Yu, Herbert D-B.</creator><contributor>Gordon, J.

The effects of procaine and mepivacaine were studied on mitochondrial respiration, calcium stimulated respiration and gramicidin-induced K+ efflux and swelling. High concentrations (about 10^-3 and 10^-4 M) of procaine and mepivacaine were found to stimulate the respiratory rates and decrease the RCRs of mitochondria. High concentrations of procaine and mepivacaine also inhibited the rate of Ca++-stimulated respiration, induced by the presence of both limited and massive amounts of Ca++, under both normel stoichiometric and "superstoichiometric” conditions. High concentrations of mepivacaine inhibited gramicidin-induced K+ efflux and gramicidin-induced swelling.</description><creator>Weinberger, Viviane S.</creator><contributor>Hosein, E.

It is believed that most political thinkers concern themselves with four basic issues when discussing violence; the definition of the concept, the reasons for its existence, the effects it has on normal social relations and its justification as a political tool. These four categories are explicated in the first part of the paper, and the views of different social and political thinkers are examined in the context of this framework. In the second part, this framework is applied to the writings of Pierre Trudeau and Pierre Vallières. It is shown how their views on violence reflect the worldview of a liberal (Trudeau) and a revolutionary (Vallières).</description><creator>Tetrault, Paul A.</creator><contributor>Metcalfe, R.

In all animals, addition of elastic or flow-resistive loads resulted in an immediate decrease in ventilation. Smaller animals exhibited higher ventilatory stability to added elastic loads. However, when the loads were expressed as a percentage of the passive elastance of the respiratory system, stability was found to be similar for all animals. The relative contributions of the passive elastance and of vagal reflexes were also found to be approximately the same in all species. In addition, all animals exhibited much greater stability to a given increase in resistance than to an equivalent increase in elastance, suggesting that the properties of the respiratory system are better designed to withstand transient changes in resistance rather than in elastance.</description><creator>Strobach, Helene</creator><contributor>Milic-Emili, J.

The Golgi apparatus exhibits an hemispherical shape lying over the nucleus. During late prophase and metaphase of the first and second maturation divisions the characteristic cap shape of the organelle is undetectable. It appears instead as a single agglomeration of lamellae, vesicles and branching tubules. During anaphase this single agglomerate breaks up into small Golgi fragments which persist in early telophase. Such a Golgi fragment is composed of 2-3 short saccules either single or loosely piled up and surrounded by vesicles and tubules of various kinds. By late telophase one Golgi fragment adheres to the nucleus, while the remaining ones gather around it to form the single Golgi apparatus. After each division the Golgi apparatus is re-formed and disposed in a corona-like manner caping the nucleus. Thus the Golgi apparatus undergoes marked morphological changes during meiosis but remains present throughout the two successive divisions.</description><creator>Pelletier, Real J.</creator><contributor>Clermont, Y.

D'un point de vue anthropologique le structuralisme a heurté le marxisme de plein front. Cependant certains marxistes groupés autour de Louis Althusser ont tenté de profiter des apports du structuralisme en appliquant aux oeuvres de Marx une méthode de lecture "symptômale". Le résultat a été de nous livrer une conception de l'homme qui, si elle se rapproche de la conception structuraliste, ne nous semble pas être celle de Marx dont elle heurte l'intention globale. Une étude de la méthode structurale et de la lecture althussérienne nous révèle en effet que, sides convergences existent quant à la structure complexe des sociétés humaines, une divergence fondamentale existe quant au sujet de l'histoire et sa perception de la société. Le rejet épistémologique du concept d'homme nous apparaît comme un refus de cette possibilité du sujet.</description><creator>Lemay, Robert M.</creator><contributor>Walker, J.

Those used in therapeutics, however, are restricted to two major groups, the plant glycosides such as digitalis and the catecholamines such as isoprenaline. The effects of the glycosides on the heart are characterized by a slow onset of action and a prolonged increase in the contractile force (Thorp and Cobbin, 1967). Although of definite clinical use, glycosides have the disadvantage of a narrow margin of safety between their effective and toxic doses. Thus, in order to improve the contractility of the failing heart, it is necessary to administer a near toxic dose. The second important group of cardiac stimulant drugs, the catecholamines, have an immediate and short action which limits their use primarily to the treatment of cardiovascular emergencies. In view of the shortcomings of both of these groups, new cardiac stimulants are sought.</description><creator>Lee, Wendy W.</creator><contributor>Richardson, J.

In this retrospective, non-randomized study, effectiveness was assessed by 5-year relative survival rates and direct costs by expenditure for hospitalization, surgery, anesthesia, radiation therapy. Results failed to show correlation between increased survival and increased costs. With radiation therapy, survival was decreased regardless of type of treatment and stage of disease. Without radiation therapy the over-all group treated by Simple Mastectomy had a slightly increased survival over Radical Mastectomy group: inexplicably, patients' survival was increased in early disease with Radical Mastectomy and in locally advanced disease with Simple Mastectomy.

The standard technique is the constant infusion method utilizing inulin as described by Shannon and Smith (33) in 1935. The GFR is calculated using the derivative formulation based on the equation of Van Slyke (32) modified for use with inulin, GFR = urine inulin concentration x urine volume / plasma inulin concentration x time, for each short urine collection period of 20-30 minutes.

The paramedian lobule sends three, non-overlapping, ipsilateral projections upon the cerebellar nuclei. The first projection is located in the ventral part of the lateral nucleus (NL), the second in the caudal part of the posterior interposed nucleus (NIP), and the third projection is found in the dorsal portion of the anterior interposed nucleus (NIA) continuing through the NL-NIA transition zone. Crus II sends two ipsilateral projections upon the cerebellar nuclei: the first is located in the anterior half of the NIP, and the second in the dorsal part of the NL continuing through the NL-NIA transition zone. Within each zone of projection of the paramedian lobule and Crus II, an orderly distribution of cortico-nuclear fibers is revealed by differences in localization of degenerated fibers after lesions in different regions of the paramedian lobule and Crus II. Since both of these lobules receive an afferent input which is organized somatotopically, the topographical distribution of cortico-nuclear fibers from the paramedian lobule and Crus II means a somatotopy.</description><creator>Diakiw, Nathalie</creator><contributor>Courville, J.

Average MUA was generally less variable and better related to the animal's response than was the AEP. The lateral septal area was the only structure where the poststimulus pattern of MUA was consistently related to whether or not the animal bar pressed. Medial septal prestimulus MUA levels were highest when the animal did not subsequently bar press, while poststimulus MUA levels were always sharply reduced from the prestimulus range, regardless of stimulus or response conditions. These results were frequently independent of whether the response was correct or incorrect.
