He called this the "Law of' Independent Movement of Ions”.  The next advance to the theory was made by Arrhenius (13). He assumed that a solution is composed of ions and neutral molecules and that the proportion of ions increased with increasing dilution.</description><creator>Tink, Roland.

But they gave a proof which is now not accepted. The first satisfactory proofs were not constructed until early in the twentieth century. These early proofs by Hilbert and others were established only if the function together with its first and second derivatives is continuous. A presentation based on these early papers and attacking the problem by the sole use of the theory of differential equations is given by E.L. Ince in his book "Ordinary Differential Equations".</description><creator>Tiffin, Brian. F.</creator><contributor>Kozakiewicz, W.

Vision purement poétique à ses débuts, elle est devenue, grâce à des expériences scientifiques de son poète, une vision, ou plutôt une prophétie scientifique. Étymologiquement parlant, le mot Unanimisme suggère une union d'Âmes. Or, il faut préciser ici ce qu'est une âme pour Romains. Puis, tâcher d'expliquer ce qu'est l'Unanimisme.

This Dutch physician described the structures now known as the "Graafian Follicles," which are visible on the ovarian surface during the fertile period of life. It was not until after primitive microscopes became available that the Russian anatomist Von Baer (1) saw and described the ovum, which is on the borderline of unaided visibility. The elucidation of the ovary as an organ of internal secretion must be attributed to Knauer (2) and Halbon (3), who proved that ovarian transplants could renew the sexual cycle of spayed animals.</description><creator>Solomon, Samuel.</creator><contributor>Heard, R.

Education, formal or otherwise, is a factor in determining what any life will be. From birth to death the educative process is acting upon each human in the nature of his experiences. The importance of these experiences is recognized but no amount of experience can have the cumulative effect of formal education. Traditionally, education is divided into three parts: primary, secondary, and higher. Primary education is usually considered to be the training of children in the basic tool-subjects of reading, writing, and arithmetic.</description><creator>Shearman, George.

It is relevant as well to consider Eyring’s picture of dielectric relaxation as an activated rate process. Following this, pertinent aspects of the structure and general properties of cellulose will be traced (33).

Towards the end of their path the competing processes of electron capture and less result in an "effective" ionic charge which thus alters the ionizing power, and therefore the energy less, of the charged particles. Furthermore, electron capture and loss in itself is a source of energy loss. Since Henderson's work with alpha particles, an extensive literature has arisen on experimental investigations of electron capture by various ions in various materials.</description><creator>Schiff, Harry.</creator><contributor>Jackson, J.

As Professor Parsons observes:- "The analysis of modern medical practice has not only given us a 'case study' of a type of social structure which is interesting and significant in itself … more than that, it has opened a 'window' which can be used for the observation of balancing processes within the social system, which have generalized significance far beyond the 'room' within the larger edifice of society into which this particular window opens … ".</description><creator>Robinson, Patricia.

The study by social workers is in turn part of a pilot study, conducted in cooperation with a physician, a psychiatrist and a psychologist. The pilot study is one of a series of such to precede a larger study with the stated aims of determining adverse environmental factors responsible for mental ill health and eliminating them at the source.The minor studies and the major project are under the direction of Dr. Eric Wittkower. [...] This study deals vith the parent families of the eighty patients. The other three sections deal vith various aspects of the patients' 111ness, the adaptive processes in the patients' families and some aspects of the patients' personalities. Each of the social workers ininterviewed twenty patients. The material obtained was shared among the four participants, each d,ealing with a separate aspect of the total social work study.</description><creator>Phillips, George.

Although he attributed his sense of "well-being" to a substance present in this testicular extract, this conclusion was completely erroneous in the light of subsequent investigations. Nevertheless, Brown-Sequard described the process of his alleged rejuvenation so convincingly, that there resulted a great stimulation of research in this field of study. Thus was furnished the impetus that led to the development of endocrinology.</description><creator>Peron, Fernand. G.</creator><contributor>Heard, R.

Unquestionably one of the most important of these factors, which ia almost invariably operative in commercial electro-refining, is the presence in the electrolyte of one or more so-called addition agents. An addition agent may be regarded simply as any substance whlch, when present in the electrolyte in relatively small amount, is capable of modifying the physical properties of the deposit. The term is generally reserved for substanoes which impart beneficial or desirable properties that would not otherwise be realized under comparable conditions of electrodeposit1on. The number of addition agents in use is very large but few have been subjected to fundamental investigation. The present investigation is an effort to obtain fundamental information which might promote some clarification of the mechanism by which addition agents exert the various effects attr1butable to them.[...]</description><creator>Parsons, Basil.

Given a space S and a mapping t of S into itself, under what circumstances is there or is there not a fixed point? By a fixed point we mean, simply, a point x in S for which tx*x. Most investigations are concerned with single valued continuous mappings and the trend has been to search for ever larger classes of spaces for which fixed point conditions can be derived.

This phrase, a prophesy at the beginning of aviation, is now the law. Nationality is also symbolic of the role of aircraft in the modern world, in which they are heralds of international goodwill or forerunners of the evil intentions of an aggressor. The preamble of the Chicago Convention states : " International civil aviation can greatly help to create and preserve friendship and understanding among the nations and people of the world, yet its abuse can become a threat to the general security.

Dr. J. S. L. Browne postulated that these hormones might exert their effect by mobilizing, or "loosening", the body tissue proteins from the internal body sources for the purpose of supplying protein building materials to loci where they might be needed (1). It was suggested that this hypothesis might be tested in the plasma protein depleted rat by studying the effects of these hormones on the regeneration of plasma protein.</description><creator>Neiman, Gregory.
