Denis Williams, in his recent review article, The Thalamus and Epilepsy (1965), has posed the question in a somewhat different form: "Is the intact centrencephalon essential for the propagation of seizures?" It is not realistic to consider the reticular formation either functionally or structurally in isolation. Its extent, events and effects are by very definition widespread and diffuse. Current concepts of epileptic pathway propagation unfortunately lack precision.</description><creator>Needham, Charles W.</creator><contributor>Gloor, P.

The amount of published data dealing with glycolysis in different tissues and systems, as well as referring to special aspects of the process, are abundant and most of them of great interest. The accumulation of knowledge on the subject is of such magnitude that it is difficult for any single individual to read and summarize all that is published about it. In the present work, the writer will deal only with the aspects of glycolysis in muscle, limiting the references to those investigations which in some manner are linked to the work presented in this thesis.</description><creator>Garcia-Arocha, Olga L.</creator><contributor>Wood, T.

After centrifugation, the activity is found in the postmitochondrial supernatant (30 x 10^3 g supernatant). Neither the postmicrosomal supernatant (100 x 10^3 g supernatant) nor the microsomal pellet (100 x 10^3 g pellet) alone has activity, but if the two are recombined a response to vitamin K1 is obtained. Liver homogenates and their subcellular fractions from warfarin pretreated rats fail to produce factor VII in the presence of vitamin K1. To localize the intracellular site of inhibition by warfarin, "cross-mixing" experiments were performed. When the postmicrosomal supernatant from warfarin pretreated rats was mixed with the microsomal pellet from vitamin K-deficient rats a response to vitamin K1 was obtained, whereas the recombination of the postmicrosomal supernatant from vitamin K-deficient rats with the microsomal pellet from warfarin pretreated rats gave no response. The results show that the formation of plasma clotting factor VII by vitamin K1 can be produced in a cell free system and that the intracellular site of inhibition by warfarin is in the microsomal fraction.</description><creator>Wang, Richard C.</creator><contributor>Lowenthal, J.

In the present study, ethanol absorption was investigated in 60 human subjects in an attempt to establish the factors affecting the normal variation range. In all cases, a standard dose of ethanol was administered in a fasting state and their blood ethanol concentrations were studied. The time period taken for the maximum blood ethanol concentration to be achieved reflects gastric absorption. By studying the timing of this maximum, the subjects could be divided into 3 groups; rapid, standard and delayed absorbers. The effects of milk, olive oil and glucuronolactone an ethanol absorption were investigated. Milk and olive oil decreased the overall blood ethanol concentration in the majority of subjects, while glucuronolactone had variable effect.</description><creator>Fam, Fathi</creator><contributor>Skoryna, S.

In 36% of the units single shocks evoked single spike discharges with mean latencies ranging from 50 to 300 msec. In 16% of the units single shocks evoked a depression of background activity with latencies ranging from 60 to 300 msec and lasting 700 msec on the average. With repetitive stimulation over a wide range of stimulation frequencies the maximum excitatory or inhibitory effect was obtained in individual units at frequencies below 10 cps. A unit was either excited or inhibited, but not both, over the whole range of stimulus frequencies used. The known phenomenon of reversal of blood pressure reflex response (from depressor to pressor) with increasing frequency of somatic afferent stimulation can be explained on the basis of some of these findings.</description><creator>Wyszogrodski, Issie</creator><contributor>Polosa, C.

Half of the animals developed a hyperdynamic circulation in response to sepsis, and the rise in cardiac output was significantly correlated with an increase in muscle capillary blood flow, demonstrating that no pre-capillary arteriovenous shunts were present. The increased flow was also related to decreased arteriovenous oxygen extraction. It was also demonstrated that after muscle exercise, in contrast to the findings after sepsis, the arteriovenous oxygen extraction was increased. This study suggests that the sequence of events seen in hypovolemic or cardiac shock (where low tissue perfusion and tissue hypoxia cause secondary cellular damage) is reversed in septic shock; a primary cellular defect occurs, causing the hemodynamic disturbance as an attempted compensatory mechanism.</description><creator>Wright, Charles J.</creator><contributor>MacLean, L.

When blood is used to support the heart, both its viscosity and diffusible calcium concentration play an important role in determining the level of left ventricular function. The existence of a linear relationship between the viscosity of blood and left ventricular pressure has been demonstrated. Various compounds capable of raising the viscosity of plasma have been evaluated. Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) is the most suitable because of its stability and lack of toxicity. When the viscosity of plasma is progressively raised, a calcium dependent linear relationship between perfusate viscosity and left ventricular pressure was also obtained. Although the properties of blood, resulting from its high viscosity cannot entirely be duplicated by artificially raising the viscosity of plasma, a new equilibrium can be achieved which although different from that of blood produces the same effects.</description><creator>Sze, Stephen</creator><contributor>Pitzele, S.

The corticosterone from peripheral blood was measured by a method based on the competitive binding of corticosteroids to Corticosteroid Binding Globulin. The Second and Third International Standard ACTH have been compared and the ACTH potency of synthetic analogs and of different species measured. This assay has been applied to the measurement of ACTH from various tumors and metastases with ectopic ACTH syndrome. A very good correlation has been achieved between the data presented in our results and those of others. The chief contribution of this assay is its application of the competitive protein binding method which requires only 10 µl of rat plasma for routine determination of corticosterone.</description><creator>Smith, Glennell R.</creator><contributor>Chretien, M.

A predominant end product after complete enzymic hydrolysis of agarose is the tetrasaccharide, neoagarotetraose, which is resistant to further degradation by agarase. This project involved the isolation of a 8-tetrasaccharidase from Pseudomonas atlantica, which hydrolyzes the 8-1, 4 linkage of neoagarotetraose. The cell-bound β-tetrasaccharidase, selectively released by EDTA-Tris-NaCl treatment of P. atlantica cells, was free of α-disaccharidase activity. β-Tetrasaccharidase and agarase were separated by isoelectric focusing and were shown to possess distinct pl values. Determination of the isoelectric points facilitated separation of the enzymes on DEAE-Sephadex. Specificity studies were carried out on the crude and DEAE-purified β-tetrasaccharidase preparations. The possible location of the β-tetrasaccharidase in the cell and some of the enzyme characteristics are discussed.</description><creator>Ross, Linda J.</creator><contributor>Yaphe, W.

Hexokinase was identified as the first rate-limiting step. In slightly acidic muscle extracts, the phospho- , fructokinase step was limiting. This was related to the amount of soluble and insoluble forms of the enzyme. The relative amounts of each form depended on the pH. The rate-limiting effect was shown to be eliminated when the muscle extracts were prepared in a slightly alkaline medium. The importance of the ATPase in the homogenates and extracts in controlling the rate of glycolysis was also shown. Increasing the amount of ATPase up to a certain level stimulates glycolysis by supplying ADP for the phosphoglycerate kinase and pyruvate kinase steps. Various enzymatic and colorimetric methods for the assay of intermediates of the pentose phosphate pathway were studied. Transaldolase was partially purified from Candida utilis.</description><creator>Poon, Wai M.</creator><contributor>Wood, T.

Damage to mitochondria by freezing at 77°K may be reduced by DMSO addition. The supplements Ficoll, dextran, MgCl2, KCl, dithiothreitol (DTT) and DMSO had no importance as stabllizers of the activity of mitochondria in liquid suspension (0°c), whereas Tricine (N-Tris (hydroxymethyl) methylglycine) and BSA, both, significantly stabilized succinate oxidase activity and Tricine also slowed the decline of respiratory control by ADP.

Two seasons of experimentation with the summer form and one with the winter form indicated that these could be grown successfully. Date of seeding was determined to be a critical factor affecting, yield, particularly with the summer form. It was suggested that the summer form should be seeded as early as possible in the spring and the winter form during the latter part of August. Population density did not have a major effect on the seed yield of either the summer or the winter form. Nitrogen level affected the yield of the summer form. Vernalization of the winter form took place mainly during the month of November, while winterkilling did not occur until March.</description><creator>Madill, John E.</creator><contributor>Lawson, N.

The ductal inlet was in line with the umbilical vein outlet (48.2%) or displaced to its right (1 - 8 mm.). The duct terminated in the left hepatic vein (48.4%), the inferior vena cava (25.8%) or the confluence of the left and middle hepatic veins (25.8%). Anatomical patency persisted in the forty-five specimens aged 0 - 7 days. A non-sphincteric lip was observed at the narrowed ductal inlet. After 7 days the duct was closed in most specimens at least at the portal end. Closure proceeded, by subendothelial thickenings, from portal to caval end. The ductal wall had abundant collagen, extensive elastic networks and a moderate muscular component. The ductal elongation rate was greatly reduced postnatally.</description><creator>MacDonald, Frank</creator><contributor>Osmond, D.

Sequences of 2, 4 and 6 digits were also presented monaurally. Whereas for the normal-hearing group right-ear dichotic scores were significantly superior, inter-subject variability resulted in a non-significant right-ear trend for the hearing-impaired group, with individuals showing marked right or left-ear advantage. The groups did not differ significantly in relative right-left hand proficiency. No correlation was found between hand and ear laterality in either group, nor between degree of ear asymmetry and vocabulary scores for hearing-impaired subjects. Discrimination of a dichotic pair by the latter subjects rarely occurred, with one digit apparently masking or suppressing the other. Prediction of speech lateralization in hearing-impaired children from dichotic digit scores was not recommended.</description><creator>Ling, Agnes N.</creator><contributor>Doehring, D.

The hypoxaemia and widened A-aDO2 observed in aspiration pneumonitis improved with IPPV, suggesting maldistribution of ventilation compatible with pulmonary oedema. Progressive plasma volume loss averaging 500 ml. after 24 hours was associated with hypotension and was best corrected by careful replacement with colloid solutions. Cardiac failure only occured in patients with pre-existing heart disease or overtransfusion. The pneumonitis was initially non-infective; and antibiotics did not prevent subsequent pulmonary infection. The mortality was 40 percent in aspiration pneumonitis and 70 percent in shock and sepsis. Advanced age, pH of aspirated gastric contents below 1.75, prolonged hypoxia and concurrent sepsis were the main factors associated with high mortality.</description><creator>Lewis, Ronald T.</creator><contributor>Hansen, L.

Because of the beneficial effect reported from pre-feeding a shocked animal an elemental diet, we served this preparation to our burnt animals. The elemental diet is a liquid diet equivalent to the normal diet, but in which total protein has been replaced by amino acids. We observed a significant improvement of the 24 hour mortality rate and a marked reduction in the incidence of the gastrointestinal lesions. It is impossible to feed the elemental diet to a patient prior to burn, but because the gastrointestinal lesions secondary to burns encountered clinically are delayed, we believe that the elemental diet could find some application in extensive burn therapy.</description><creator>Langlois, Pierre</creator><contributor>Williams, H.

To determine the possible origin of these conjugates, their excretion was measured in women prior to and following parturition and in non-pregnant women. Double isotope assays were employed to characterize and quantify all urinary steroids, the main ones being the sulfates of cortisol, cortisone, corticosterone, 11-dehydrocorticosterone, and the glucuronides of tetrahydrocortisone and tetrahydrocortisol. Prior to delivery the mean excretion of cortisol sulfate and cortisone sulfate was 193 and 54 µg /day. The values for the glucuronides of tetrahydrocortisol and tetrahydrocortisone were 986 and 2000 µg/day. The mean excretion rate of corticosterone sulfate and 11-dehydrocorticosterone sulfate was 219 and 35 µg/day respectively. Following parturition the excretion of all these sulfates decreased three to sevenfold, falling within the range observed for non-pregnant women. The data are consistent with our previous hypothesis that during the last trimester of pregnancy these steroid sulfates originate mainly from the fetus. Following birth their urinary output by the newborn reflects processes which were initiated in utero.</description><creator>Kertesz, Janos P.</creator><contributor>Klein, G.

Sodium salts of these products were examined by intubation technique in rats for their suppressive activity of intestinal absorption of radioactive strontium and calcium. In vitro binding capacity was tested by dialysis against water containing strontium and calcium. 'Poly-L-guluronic acid' was found to be most effective; its degradation products did not show any higher activity. These degradation products had a lower degree of polymerization than the parent compound and it appears that the maximal gel formation with strontium occurs. It was concluded that high biological activity is dependent on chemical composition, including guluronic acid content, viscosity, chain length. Inhibition of calcium absorption was invariably low and the various preparations did not show any significant difference in their effectiveness.</description><creator>Hurlburt, Andrea J.</creator><contributor>Skoryna, S.

The only significant changes observed were for the PV and RCV and these changes can probably be accounted for by pre, intra and post-operative blood loss. The stable extracellular spaces were parallelled by unchanging large vessel and whole body hematocrits. Although not statistically significant, some interesting tendencies were observed when the sodium and inulin spaces were compared, suggesting that the simultaneous use of a large non-diffusable molecule and a smaller diffusable isotope could be beneficial in estimating the interstitial water space.</description><creator>Freeman, Joel B.</creator><contributor>Gutelius, J.

The technique is rapid (8 hours), sensitive (to 1 microgram/100 ml.), and requires small sample volumes (1 ml.). The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and precision of the assay have been determined. The literature on progesterone in pregnancy has been reviewed concerning; synthesis and metabolism, reported plasma levels and alternative assay techniques. Plasma progesterone levels, (in microgram/100 ml.), are reported throughout normal pregnancy to delivery, (early: 1 - 5, late; 5 - 25), postpartum (0), and fetal levels (umbilical vein; 40.8, artery; 18.7). There is poor correlation between progesterone levels and the "progesterone effect" by vaginal cytology. In threatened abortion, abnormally low progesterone levels (below 1), carry a poor prognosis. With intrauterine fetal death, levels varied from abnormally low to normal values, (1.1 - 15.8).</description><creator>Dorr, Patrick.</creator><contributor>Murphy, B.
