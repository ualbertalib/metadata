The LCP selected for this work was a main-chain type copolyester exhibiting low solubility and high chemical resistance.  Therefore, melt-blending was used to prepare blends.  Polarized light microscopy, in conjunction with a heating/shearing stage, was employed to observe the evolution of the phase-separated structure in the blends.  Phase separation in the blends was observed with increasing temperature.  Two phase separation temperatures (Tsp1 and Tsp2) were determined for each LCP/PC blend composition.  Thus, the phase diagram, obtained under quiescent conditions, exhibited three regions separated by two internal boundaries.   Thermally induced phase separation in the blends at different positions of the phase diagram was investigated.  A wide range of phase-separated morphologies was observed.  Blends containing 20 – 30 wt.% LCP developed into inter-connected structures, which is one of the characteristic of spinodal decomposition.  Blends with other LCP contents (up to 60 wt.%) formed droplet-type structure.  Coarsening of the phase-separated domains was also observed in the late stages of the phase separation.   The effects of low steady shear rate on the phase diagram and phase-separated morphology of the blends were examined.  Compared to the phase diagram under quiescent conditions, phase separation temperatures were shifted to lower values at the corresponding concentrations.  Also, the speed and extent of phase separation in the 50 wt.% blends increased, when shear was applied.  Thus, the blend exhibited shear-induced phase separation behavior at low shear rates.</description><description>Cette thèse a pour but d’approfondir les connaissances sur les procédés de séparation de phases dans des mélanges de polymères cristallins liquides (LCP) et de polycarbonate (PC) soumis à des fluctuations de température et de cisaillement (cisaillement faible et constant).  Le LCP choisi pour ce travail était un type copolyester de chaîne principale, à résistance chimique élevée et à solubilité faible.  Un procédé de fonte a été employé pour préparer les échantillons.  La photomicroscopie polarisée couplée à un système de chauffage/cisaillement a été utilisée pour observer l'évolution des structures des phases séparées dans les mélanges. La séparation de phases a été observée dans le mélange au fur et à mesure que la température augmentait. Deux températures de séparation de phases (Tsp1 et Tsp2) ont été déterminées pour les diverses compositions des échantillons de LCP/PC. Ainsi, le diagramme de phase montre trois régions, séparées par deux frontières internes. La séparation de phases induite thermiquement dans les mélanges à diverses positions dans le diagramme de phase a été investiguée. Une grande variété de morphologies a été observée. Des mélanges contenant de 20 à 30 wt.% de LCP ont développé des structures interconnectées, caractéristiques de la décomposition spinodale. Des mélanges à plus forte concentration de LCP (jusqu'à 60 wt.%) développaient une structure de gouttelettes. Dans les étapes avancées de la séparation de phases, la limite entre les domaines de phases séparées devenait plus grossière. Les effets du cisaillement constant à faible taux sur le diagramme de phase et sur la morphologie des mélanges à phases séparées ont été examinés. Comparativement aux diagrammes de phases en conditions de repos, les températures de séparations de phases en instance de cisaillement étaient plus basses.

CPS determines particle-particle interaction forces through creating particle collisions and extracting the interaction forces from the degree of asymmetry of the collision trajectories. Since the force to deflect a micron-sized particle is much smaller than that to deform a macroscopic spring or cantilever used in a commercial force apparatus, this new technique increases the resolution of force determination by four orders of magnitude. Based on the CPS principles, we have built a force apparatus called "microcollider". It successfully determined the van der Waals forces and the electrostatic force between two 5 $ mu$m latex spheres at different salt concentrations. A "hairy" latex model was introduced to explain the measured van der Waals forces which are weaker than those predicted by theory assuming smooth latex surfaces. This is consistent with other experimental findings about the surfaces of latex particles. A similar "hairy" model was applied to determine the adsorption layer thicknesses of two triblock copolymers adsorbed on latex particles. The results show that the configuration of the buoy block composed of polyethylene oxide (PEO) is more extended than a random PEO coil, which agrees with theoretical predictions. Moreover, excellent quantitative agreement between the adsorption layer thicknesses determined by CPS and other methods has been found. Dynamic steric interactions between two high molecular weight PEO adlayers have also been studied. Both the elastic modulus and the adsorption layer thickness were determined. The results show that a thick layer has a lower elastic modulus than a thin one composed of the same polymer. This implies that an extended loop/tail structure in a thick layer is less stiff than a flat compact one in a thin layer, which is consistent with theory. In addition, the microcollider can accurately determine particle-wall interactions as well. A rather weak electrokinetic lift force was measured. The results are in good agreement with the solutions rigorously derived from two new theories.</description><creator>Wu, Xin, 1967-</creator><contributor>Ven, T. G.

These informal exchanges are argued to develop in response to the weak penetration of formal state structures and capitalist market relations in peripheral regions. This case study of the survival strategies of low income rural mothers who live in Quebec village demonstrates that these mothers' avenues for economic and social integration are restricted by the formal and informal sectors which constitute and reinforce one another. First, an extensive data and document analysis of the Quebec pronatalist and welfare policies reveals that they fail to provide low income rural women access to appropriate training and education, to transportation and adequately subsidized child care, or to secure jobs. This restricts these women's integration into formal or informal systems of support and exchange. The second section draws on interviews with 20 community leaders and on two years of participant observation. Contrary to the literature which suggests that extensive informal ties promote socially and economically inclusive rural communities, this case study reveals that centralized state development policies limit local community initiative and independence. Hence, community effort to aid low income families are limited to charity which does not fundamentally alter these families' marginal position. The third section draws on semi-structured interviews with 20 low income single and married (or common-law) mothers. Comparing the single and married mothers' strategies reveals that studies of the rural informal sector have narrowly defined the sector, by excluding unpaid domestic and child care work. It is shown that the married mother's strategy to stay in the home is a viable one because she alone performs the unpaid work of the home. This results in her isolation in the domestic sphere. For the single mothers who seek paid work, the gende</description><creator>Young, Grace, 1956-</creator><contributor>Benaquists, Lucia (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Family policy -- Québec (Province)</subject><subject>Rural poor -- Québec (Province)</subject><subject>Poor women -- Québec (Province)</subject><subject>Rural families -- Québec (Province) -- Economic conditions.</subject><subject>Rural women -- Québec (Province) -- Economic conditions.</subject><title>The survival strategies of rural low income mothers</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4t64gp927.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w3763856p</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Sociology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:r494vm597</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:18:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis describes detailed studies of the upconversion dynamics of Er$ sp{3+}$:YAlO$ sb3$ (YAP), Er$ sp{3+}$:YAG, Tm$ sp{3+}$:Y$ rm sb2BaF sb8$ (YAB) and the avalanche upconversion dynamics of Tm$ sp{3+}$:YLiF$ sb4$ (YLF). Upconversion dynamics of Er$ sp{3+}$:YAP, and Er$ sp{3+}$:YAG are analyzed by a rate equation model which includes four energy transfer processes. It was found that good fits to the experimental data can be achieved only when the fourth power activator concentration dependent energy transfer terms (when the energy transfer is fourth order kinetically) are included in the rate equation. To study avalanche upconversion dynamics of Tm$ sp{3+}$:YLF measurements of the time dependent upconversion luminescence intensity were made under different pumping wavelengths and different pumping powers at both low temperature and room temperature. The pumping power dependent upconversion luminescence was also measured. To describe the avalanche upconversion dynamics a rate equation model which includes both the cross-relaxation and energy transfer processes was developed. Satisfactory fits or simulations of the experimental data were obtained in every case. Through this work it was found that the energy transfer term is proportional to the second power of the activator concentration (second order kinetically) at low activator concentration and proportional to the fourth power of the activator concentration (fourth order kinetically) at high activator concentration. To obtain the fourth power activator concentration dependent energy transfer term, the existing three-body interaction model obtained from the second order perturbation theory was extended to the case of four-body interaction, and a two-body interaction dipole-dipole energy transfer model based on regular distribution of the donors and acceptors and two dimensional transfer was built. Upconversion dynamics of Tm$ sp{3+}$:YBF is analyzed by a rate equation model which includes two energy transfer processes. Satisfactory fits of the experimental data were obtained by this model. Pump-probe measurements of the temperature and power dependence of the upconversion gain for the blue emission at 482 nm from Tm$ sp{3+}$:YBF are presented.</description><creator>Wang, Jianan, 1957-</creator><contributor>Simkin, D.

Ten Grade 7 students, who had received no prior technology education instruction, were formed into single-sex dyads and provided with a design brief from which they designed and made a technological solution. The natural talk between the subjects was transcribed. A description of their designing-in-action was added to the transcript. Actions were coded using an empirically derived scheme grounded in both a general problem-solving model and theoretical models of the design process. Segments coded as designing were analyzed using descriptive statistics. This analysis provided the data for mapping, that is, visually representing the design process used by subjects. Results showed that novice designers do not design in the way described in textbooks. Their strategy is not linear but highly iterative. Subjects developed their ideas using three-dimensional materials rather than two-dimensional sketches. They were unlikely to generate several possible solutions prior to modelling, but developed solutions serially. The act of modelling stimulated the generation of additional ideas. Evaluation occurred repeatedly throughout their designing.</description><creator>Welch, Malcolm W.

The experimental portion of the study was designed to provide information on the moisture and temperature distributions in relation to elapsed time and distance from the heat source. Tests were conducted on three different materials: (a) buffer (equal proportion of silica sand and sodium bentonite), (b) backfill (25 percent low swelling clay and 75 percent crushed granite rock), and (c) sand. Each material was compacted to its maximum dry density and optimum water content. The experiments were performed with the application of external hydraulic and temperature gradients in opposite directions. Swelling pressure tests were performed to quantify the local swelling pressure as well as the wall's effect on the resultant reaction pressure. The effect of swelling pressure on hydraulic pressure and local volume change has been studied using the experimental results. In the theoretical part of this research, a numerical solution of the governing coupled heat and mass flow equations was obtained via the implicit finite difference method. The solution was then used in conjunction with Powell's optimization technique to back-calculate the transport coefficients. A sensitivity analysis of the volumetric water content and temperature with respect to the transport coefficient was performed. Using the calculated transport parameters, the moisture content profile was predicted. The experimental results have shown that moisture flows from the hot and cold ends to the middle part of the soil column. The developed local swelling pressure appears to have significant effect on moisture movement and hydraulic pressure. The use of a sand layer between the buffer and waste container has been observed to be very useful in reducing the shrinkage of the buffer material. The numerical results strongly support the dependence of the transport coefficients, in the governing coupled heat and moisture flow equations, on temperature and volumetric water content.</description><creator>Shooshpasha, Issa.</creator><contributor>Yong, R.

A review of large maize development projects and a survey of maize farmers on small landholdings indicated that mechanized production of maize grain is technically and economically impractical. Maize is normally grown and harvested in the green immature stage by small-scale farmers as a fast, easy, and relatively profitable sideline vegetable crop. An imported hybrid and an improved local landrace (ICTA Farm Corn) yielded more green maize than a Mexican-bred locally-distributed variety, following early (June) rainy season plantings. Hybrid and local unimproved open-pollinated maize were grown with two levels of weed control and with two levels of fertilizer application following late (November) rainy season plantings. For commercial carnival season production of green maize on productive soils in Trinidad, the purchase of imported hybrid seed is economically justifiable, but high inputs into weed control and fertility management may not be needed. A consumer preference study of the main varietal types eaten as boiled ears indicated panelists could not discern differences when seasoned with Creole seasoning, but preferred yellow, large-eared varieties when not seasoned. In a series of 11 variety trials on Inceptisolic and Ultasolic soils in Trinidad, imported hybrids and ICTA Farm Corn consistently yielded greater than 9 other varieties. Grid mass selection for ear weight and ear size was carried out in ICTA Farm Corn. Green maize ear length (1.9% cycle$ sp{-1}$), width (1.5% cycle$ sp {-1}$), and ear weight (2.4% cycle$ sp{-1}$) increased linearly with selection, leading to increases in green marketable (4.4% cycle$ sp{-1}$), green total (3.0% cycle$ sp{-1}$), and grain yield ha$ sp{-1}$ (4.3% cycle$ sp{-1}$). Phenotypic correlations indicated high levels of association between grain yield and both green marketable ear weight (r = 0.91</description><creator>Spaner, Dean Michael.</creator><contributor>Mather, D.

The resulting ingots, containing monocrystals of up to 2 centimeters in one dimension, were free of microcracks, voids and free of adhesion to the inner wall of the quartz ampoule. This was made possible by the unique use of a coating of boron nitride deposited on the inner wall of the ampoule prior to charging with the elements. The boron nitride acted as an effective getter in reducing the oxygen content in the starting copper, thus eliminating the adhesion between the ingot and the quartz. Reduction of the oxygen in the copper, by prior heat-treatment under high vacuum pumping, was found to be less effective than the boron nitride. The one-ampoule method used, resulted always in ingots having a uniform composition and conductivity type, which was p-type for stoichiometric starting proportions of the elements. In ingots with non-stoichiometric starting compositions, the resulting conductivity type, in the main part of the ingot, was also uniform, either p-type or n-type, with a composition close to stoichiometry. However, for non-stoichiometric melts, the last region to freeze contained binary compound phases of the elements with an excess over stoichiometry. In the main single phase chalcopyrite region, it was found that, generally speaking, n-type conductivity prevailed when the indium content was greater than about 25% and p-type when it was less than this proportion, as determined by EPMA. This was apparently irrespective of the copper or selenium content. The ingots were found to cleave, up to 1 cm$ sp2$ in area, in one of two principal cleavage planes, which are the $ {$112$ }$ and $ {$101$ }$.

Relevant concepts and techniques of statistical polymer physics are discussed; in particular, a simulation technique that is very efficient for studying polymer brushes is introduced. This technique is demonstrated through simulations of a well characterized polymer brush system. The results of original investigations of phase separation in polymer brushes are also presented. An instability in the lateral monomer density of a polymer brush is observed under sufficiently poor solvent conditions. The onset of this instability is found to agree with a previous prediction. A compositional instability is found in the lateral densities of a two-component polymer brush under conditions of sufficient immiscibility between the two components. The effects of varying solvent conditions are considered. Finally, the onset of the compositional instability is determined using the technique of the self consistent mean field, and the results compared to simulation.</description><creator>Soga, K.

Sixty seven paraffin-embedded lung tissue samples of silicotic gold miners (39 non-lung cancer (NLC-SI) and 28 lung cancer (LC-SI)), were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy for angular particles and fibres/cleavage fragments. Crystalline silica was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction on silver membrane filter. Results indicated that both silicotic groups had non-significantly different concentrations and sizes of all particle types except quartz. Indeed, the NLC-SI group had a higher concentration of quartz than the LC-SI (3.77 $ mu$g/mg dry lung tissue compared to 2.47 $ mu$g/mg, p = 0.006, Mann-Whitney test). After adjusting for the differences in age at death, silicosis severity, and other dust exposure variables, but not for unknown smoking habit, the NLC-SI group still had a higher, through statistically non-significant, quartz concentration than did the LC-SI group (3.34 and 2.35 $ mu$g/mg respectively, p = 0.106, ANCOVA). This pattern was in good agreement with a pattern of a higher silicosis severity score in the NLC-SI group. The calendar year of first exposure was a prime determinant of lung burden of total particles, silica, and clay, with the coefficients of determination $ rm (R sp2)$ of 11-15%. A significant correlation between the concentrations of silica particles and quartz was observed, although quartz was the only significant predictor of the silicosis severity in the gold miners $ rm (p &lt; 0.001, R sp2 = 20.5 %).$ A significant correlation between quartz concentration and the year interval since last exposure to death (r = + 0.25, $ rm p &lt; 0.05)$ suggested a possibility of impaired lung clearance of quartz. Years of dust exposure did not show a significant linear relationship with any types of lung particles. The very low asbestos concentrations detected in only a small number of cases ruled out the suspicion of asbestos as a confounder of lung cancer in the miners. In conclusion, this study of lung concentration of quartz and other minerals did not support the association of silica, silicosis, and lung cancer.</description><creator>Loosereewanich, Preecha</creator><contributor>DuFresne, Andre (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Health Sciences, Occupational Health and Safety.</subject><title>Association between pulmonary dust retention and dust exposure history, silicosis severity, and the presence of lung cancer in silicotic gold miners of the Province of Ontario, Canada</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j3860851j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/000001669</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Occupational Health</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9p290c10n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:18:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>During HIV-1 assembly, the major mammalian tRNA$ rm sp{Lys}$ isoacceptors, tRNA$ rm sp{Lys1,2}$ and tRNA$ rm sp{Lys3},$ are selectively incorporated into the virus. My project has been to study the mechanism involved in this process. This was done by transfecting COS-7 cells with wild type and mutant HIV-1 proviral DNA, and analyzing the effects of these mutations on this process. In the wild type virus, 60% of viral low molecular weight RNA is tRNA$ rm sp{Lys},$ compared to 6% of the tRNA in the cytoplasm, i.e, the packaging of tRNA$ rm sp{Lys}$ is selective. HIV-1 contains approximately 8 molecules of tRNA$ rm sp{Lys3},$ the primer for reverse transcriptase, per virion. Mutations which either remove the 5$ sp prime$ portion of the RNA genome, including the primer binding site, or which reduce genomic RNA incorporation approximately 10 fold, have no effect upon select tRNA$ rm sp{Lys}$ incorporation, indicating that genomic RNA does not play a role in this process. On the other hand, a large deletion of RT sequences in Pr160$ rm sp{gag-pol}$ reduces tRNA$ rm sp{Lys3}$ incorporation to approximately 1 molecule/virion, i.e, inhibits select packaging of tRNA$ rm sp{Lys}.$ Initial evidence implicating Pr160$ rm sp{gag-pol}$ as being the viral precursor protein carrying tRNA$ rm sp{Lys}$ into the virus is as follows: (1) Viral particles composed only of Pr55$ rm sp{gag}$ do not selectively package tRNA$ rm sp{Lys},$ while viral particles composed of both Pr55$ rm sp{gag}$ and Pr160$ rm sp{gag-pol}$ do. (2) Immature viral particles, unable to process these precursor proteins due to an inactive viral protease, still show select tRNA$ rm sp{Lys}$ packaging, indicating that processing of precursor proteins is not required. We next investigated regions within Pr160$ rm sp{gag-pol}$ which may play a role in the tRNA$ rm sp{Lys}$ packaging process using mutational analysis.

The use of power electronics in fast acting power controllers is one of the backbones of the implementation of FACTS. This thesis deals with the use of force-commutated Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) ac controller technology in phase-shifting and var compensation applications. The proposed technology employes as the building block a 4-switch PWM ac controller, which is controlled by means of duty cycle variation. The difficulties of using PWM in high power applications are overcome with a new multi-module PWM ac controller operated with symmetrically phase shifted carriers. This solution results in harmonic cancellation and consequently in high quality (less distortion) waveforms with the power switches (GTO) switching at low frequencies, thus keeping the communication losses low. The resulting power controllers can be considered as intermediate FACTS devices in terms of performance and flexibility. An application of one phase-shifter and two var compensators in a tie line is also proposed for suppressing inter-area power oscillations. In this scheme the inter-area mode is deactivated if the FACTS devices keep constant the active and reactive power that flow in the tie line. Furthermore, the two interconnected subsystems were virtually decoupled with the proposed approach, in the sense that the small signal disturbances that occur in one side of the tie line do not affect the machines of the other side.</description><creator>Lopes, Luiz Antonio Correa.</creator><contributor>Ooi, Boon-Teck (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Foos, Geza (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Energy.</subject><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>On the utilization of force-commutated AC controllers in AC power transmission systems</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1v53jz81f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zw12z6979</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:05741t38p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:18:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis my initial goal was to use yellow warblers to examine the effect of paternal care on female mate choice. I first examined whether mate choice based on paternal care could be considered adaptive. Paternal care was variable among males and important to female fitness, but, contrary to a previous report, male chest striping could not be used to predict paternal care. Females did not compensate for reductions of male parental care, which resulted in significantly reduced nestling growth. In chapter two I tested the idea that monogamy in birds is maintained because of the need for biparental care. I reduced the need of strict biparental care by providing pairs at some nests with supplemental food, and found that the main effect of supplemental food was on maternal, not paternal behaviour. The first two chapters suggest that males and females provide for their brood independently from each other, which is in disagreement with current models on the maintenance of biparental care. These models assume that any given factor must affect maternal and paternal care equally for biparental care to be maintained. In Chapter three I showed that the effects of brood size and nestling age on parental care are similar for both sexes. In Chapter four I deal with age-related changes in reproductive success and the possible effects on female mate choice. Age affected the likelihood of breeding in females, but only the time of breeding in males. These changes were accompanied by age-related increases in size in both sexes. These results raise the possibility of age-related increases in parental ability, and female preference for older males.</description><creator>Lozano, George A.</creator><contributor>Lemon, Robert E.

With respect to human health resources, there is lack of agreement among the competence level, performance and the needs of both the system using them and the target population. Therefore, it is important and necessary to consider both the community and health services as partners in the task of defining these changes and in the provision of health services to meet the above mentioned criteria. The main purpose of this partnership is to encourage efforts to promote, oversee, and apply the actions in each one of the instances in order to improve training of human resource, strengthen local health systems, and empower the communities. Human resource competence and performance, the capacity to provide services, and the degree of community participation and commitement to health, are key elements in improving service quality. The philosophy of current curricula reform at the Valle University stresses the partnership relationship between academic institutions, services centers, and the community, in the training of health professionals. The proposed investigation focuses on the community-based training aspect of student performance assessment and its relation to the health care system and academia. Specifically, the study will focus on designing valid and reliable instruments for community assessment of student performance, using both qualitative and quantitative aspects of data collection and analysis to assess "patient satisfaction" as an indicator of quality of care. The results of this study demonstrate that the proposed assessment activity will allow the educational and health services institutions to have relevant and dynamic information as feedback for planning and adjustment of their programs. At the same time, it will allow the community to participate in an effective way in aspects related to their health care. The results of this study will be used as a basis for producing guidelines for involving communities (users) in the health care students evaluation process.</description><creator>Salazar, Ligia de.</creator><contributor>Patel, Vimla L.

In primary cultures of murine or rabbit spinal cord, or human fibroblasts, brief exposure to activators of PKC led to the following changes in IFs: (1) Disassembly of GFAP-filaments in astrocytes and of vimentin in fibroblasts and fragmentation of the neurofilament (NF) network in neuronal cell bodies (occurred within 30 minutes). The distribution of PKC isoforms was investigated in these cell types and no IF-associated isoform was found. Disassembly of IFs may be explained by direct phosphorylation of N-terminal domains of IFs by PKC. (2) Activation of PKC led also to changes similar to those occurring in various motor neuron diseases: Focal swellings of proximal neurites of motor neurons, but not other types of neurons (within hours), and hyperphosphorylation of C-terminal domains of NF proteins (persisting over days). NF phosphorylation was determined by increased immunoreactivity with antibodies SMI31 and SMI34 recognizing NF proteins (NF-M &amp; NF-H) when C-terminal KSP repeat domains are in intermediate and hyperphosphorylated states, respectively. Increased SMI34 labeling was prevented by pretreatment with the selective NMDA receptor antagonist, D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV), but not by the AMPA/kainate antagonist, CNQX, or the metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist, MCPG, indicating a cooperative effect of NMDA receptor activation in PKC-induced NF hyperphosphorylation. Since PKC does not phosphorylate C-terminal domains of NF proteins, involvement of other kinases was investigated. Hyperphosphorylation of NFs induced by PKC was prevented by the specific Ca$ sp{2+}$/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitor, KN-62, but not by its analogue, KN-04. The following mechanism is proposed for NF hyperphosphorylation in motor neuron diseases: Activation of PKC, as a nonspecific response to injury, acts cooperati The results of the present thesis together demonstrate multiple effects of PKC activation on modulation of IFs that might contribute to dysfunction of cells in certain diseases.</description><creator>Doroudchi, Mohammad Mehdi</creator><contributor>Durham, Heather D.

This thesis tested the postulate that selective target injury within the CNS may reflect target-cell rather than effector-cell properties. Differences in susceptibility of CNS neural cells to a common immune mediator or the cell-specific expression of a surface receptor for a putative injury mediator could result in specific target cell injury. With regard to the former possibility, OL amongst neural cells were selectively vulnerable to the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF), death occurring via apoptosis. With regard to the latter possibility, the cytokines $ gamma$-interferon, TNF, and interlukin (IL)-1, selectively upregulated the expression of heat shock protein-72, a postulated ligand for cytolytic $ gamma delta$-T cells, on OL in mixed glial cell cultures via a final common pathway involving IL-1 binding to its receptor on OL. In addition, OL amongst other glial cells in vitro selectively expressed fas, a cell surface receptor that transduces apoptotic cell death signals when ligated by agonist antibodies or by fas ligand (FasL). Fas ligation on OL resulted in OL cell death via a novel apoptosis-independent lytic mechanism. Selective upregulation of fas on OL and FasL on microglia in MS lesions compared to control CNS tissue further implicated fas signalling as a potential contributor to OL pathology in MS. Only ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) amongst an array of neurotrophic factors and cytokines protected OL from TNF-mediated apoptosis. CNTF did not protect other neural cells from TNF-mediated apoptosis, nor did it protect OL from lytic injury mediated by activated $ rm CD4 sp+$ T cells or by fas ligation.

Through an analysis of the development process occurring in a completed sites and services project in Zihuatanejo, Mexico, this thesis investigates such a concept as a physical phenomenon. The physical evolution of the houses towards consolidation is analyzed with regard to two of the factors that shape the development process: the habitable area, and the construction quality, from which the people's physical priorities for housing are inferred. The findings of this study are compared with those of earlier studies, and the broader implications of such findings are briefly outlined.

Data, obtained during cloudy daylight and at night were used to produce meaningful surface radiation maps of the experimental site. For all periods of observation the range in values recorded between any two sensors was greatest between those positioned in the forest. Spatially, net radiation varied most within the forest. The location of high and low net radiation values recorded during the day are the reverse at night. The spruce canopy reduces net radiation at the snow surface on cloudy days by obstructing a portion of the incident diffuse sky radiation. Conversely, the canopy is shown to exert considerable effect as a source of longwave radiation. Surface net longwave radiation increases sharply with proximity to trees. The effect of local and snow surface topography is greatest on clear days when irradiance is highly directional. On clear nights the forest edge is distinguished by a steep gradient of net radiation. On cloudy nights the variability and range in surface net radiation are greatly reduced.</description><creator>Nadeau, C.

A control plot with no form of soil conservation was also established. Topographic and soils surveys of these plots were conducted. Rainfall, runoff and soil loss were measured over one wet season. Crop yields and construction and maintenance costs were also determined. For rainfall amounts between 14.2 and 211.2 mm, runoff depths varied from 0.6 to 203.6 mm in the control plot, 2.1 to 199.2 mm in the contour drained plot, 3.2 to 155.1 mm in the strip cropped plot and 1.3 to 94.7 mm in the terraced plot. The largest amounts of runoff were most often recorded in the strip cropped plot, while on most occasions, the terraced plot produced the least runoff. Soil loss rates varied from 0.01 to 1.77 kg/ha in the control plot, 0.07 to 16.88 kg/ha in the contour drained plot, 0.2 to 28.86 kg/ha in the strip cropped plot and 0.01 to 6.62 kg/ha in the terraced plot. Construction costs per hectare were EC$5565 for the contour drainage system, EC $5425 for the strip cropped system and EC$6350 for the terraced system. Further monitoring of the conservation systems is required for prediction of their long-term effectiveness in runoff and soil erosion control.</description><creator>Norville, Peter</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Soil conservation -- Saint Lucia.</subject><title>The design and evaluation of soil conservation systems in St. Lucia /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rb68xc82k.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pv63g1380</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Agricultural Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zw12z660n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:18:36Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Impatiens walleriana Hook.f. is a popular bedding plant with a variety of flower colours excepting yellow. Transfer of this characteristic could be achieved through somatic hybridization, thus this study was an attempt to establish the basic parameters of tissue and protoplast culture. The condition of the stock plants and surface sterilisation techniques are important for this species. Most tissues responded to trials for callus induction with rhizogenesis. Evaluation of media and plant growth regulator combinations revealed that axillary shoot proliferation was most efficient on MS medium with 3.0 mg/L BAP and 0.1 mg/L IBA. Protoplast isolation was most effective in 0.5% w/v cellulase and 0.25% w/v pectinase with 0.25 M mannitol and 0.25 M glucose yielding 2.70 $ times$ 10$ sp5$ protoplasts per gram of leaf tissue. The presence of mucous, raphids and excessive debris inhibited successful culture of leaf mesophyll protoplasts. Cotyledon protoplasts show promise for such investigations.</description><creator>Delafield, Susan J.</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Impatiens -- Breeding.</subject><subject>Impatiens -- Color.</subject><title>Development of tissue and protoplast culture techniques for Impatiens walleriana Hook. f. with a view to the transfer of yellow flower colour</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fx719n52d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zw12z660n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Plant Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vh53ww97s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:18:36Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In order to clone the DNA repair gene of Aspergillus nidulans, uvsF$ sp-$ pyrG$ sp-$ strains were transformed with a genomic library in a plasmid vector that carried the pyr-4 gene of Neurospora which complements pyrG mutants of Aspergillus. Out of the several transformants obtained, four were like wild type. For rescuing plasmids, transformant DNA was digested with Bg/II and self ligated, and used for transformation of E. coli. Two types of plasmids were obtained; these two had a region in common ($&lt;$1.0 kb) that was not a simple overlap and gave evidence for rearrangements. Surprisingly, only the plasmids with the larger insert of Aspergillus DNA were able to complement uvsF$ sp-$ in the secondary transformation. Northerns of polyA$ sp+$-enriched mRNA, probed with this plasmid, showed three bands. However, its subclone which spans the shared region hybridized to only one of them (1.0 kb). Two cDNA and five genomic clones were identified. The two cDNA clones though not identical, cross-hybridized. Three out of five genomic clones were identical. The cDNA hybridized to a short segment (2.2 kb) of one of the three types of genomic clones, locating the putative uvsF gene sequence.</description><creator>Oza, Kalpesh</creator><date>1989</date><subject>DNA repair.</subject><subject>Molecular cloning.</subject><subject>Aspergillus.</subject><title>Cloning of a DNA repair gene (uvsF) from Aspergillus</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d504rm53v.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vh53ww97s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gf06g407c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:18:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis broadly seeks to present some relevant legal aspects concerning Flight Information Regions (FIRs) and to analyze State responsibility vis-a-vis FIRs, as well as liability incurred by States on account of acts and omissions while discharging their responsibilities. The first part of this thesis is a presentation of the international rules and regulations applicable to FIRs, their legal implications and the extent to which they create obligations for States. Some relevant problems (accidents, airspace congestion, unlawful interference) likely to present an additional challenge for the discharge of responsibilities with regard to FIRs are also considered. Settlement of differences between States deserves special attention and is discussed in the light of the judicial machinery provided under the Chicago Convention 1944. Finally, the liability of States is analyzed and the need for a strict liability regime and a policy of risk management is considered.</description><creator>Correia e Silva, Benilde</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Transportation.</subject><subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</subject><title>Some legal aspects of flight information regions</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wd375x48m.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gf06g407c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3f462666x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:18:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Two underground concrete manure reservoirs of 70 m$ sp3$ were tested for their infiltration rate to water as well as to 1% and 3% total solid dairy manure. Positive and negative infiltration were measured for the water test while only negative infiltration was measured with the manure. Positive infiltration is met when the water table into the soil is above the liquid level into the reservoir. In that case, the water is moving from the outside to the inside of the reservoir. An opposite situation is met when the infiltration is negative. From the results, the infiltration rate varied from 0.00 to 6.684 $ times$ 10$ sp{-7}$ m/s. The minimum value was recorded at the reservoir 55 with 1% of total solid manure and the maximum value was recorded with same reservoir with positive pressure to water.</description><creator>Denis, Jacques</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Concrete -- Permeability.</subject><subject>Septic tanks.</subject><subject>Seepage.</subject><subject>Farm manure, Liquid -- Storage.</subject><title>La perméabilité des réservoirs à lisier en béton /</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3x816n69t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3f462666x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Agricultural Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):30400</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
