Besides quoting relevant bibliography, writings from the composer himself and recordings were used as sources. An overview of Prado’s biography and piano works sets the context of the present study. The correspondences between the musical text and extramusical references were identified in order to examine how the composer musically conveys such references. Performance implications of the associations were analyzed, providing suggestions for pianists who wish to perform these works.</description><creator>Thys, Marcelo</creator><contributor>Gandelman, Salomea (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2015</date><subject>Music -- 20th century -- History and criticism.</subject><subject>Prado, Almeida.</subject><subject>Piano music -- Analysis, appreciation.</subject><title>Almeida Prado and his extramusical inspirations : a study focused on selected piano works</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t722hc689.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dv13zx30s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Music (Performance Studies)</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Schulich School of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fj236501h</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:49:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis does not purport to present anything new on the subject of the education or superior chi1dren.

Experimental products obtainedby adding known proportions of materials representing sediments, etc., to igneous rocks are described for comparison with natural rocks. Experiments resulting in the separation of ore minerals from rock melts have yielded important evidence regarding the processes of ore separation from magmas.

This evidence was based mainly on the fact that many of these reactions apparently did not go to completion, and yet there did not seem to be a true chemical equilibrium between the reactants and the products. Thus, when an equimolecular mixture of the unsaturated hydrocarbon and halogen hydride was allowed to react, an excess of the latter was always found present, even when there appeared to be no further reaction.

Le présent document soutien que la multi-percussion soliste s'est développée comme une discipline hybride sous l'impulsion des compositeurs et interprètes, qui ont fait éclater les frontières techniques et expressives habituelles pour incorporer le medium électronique, tout comme des éléments provenant de la danse, du drame ou de l'art conceptuel. Le mémoire présent les résultats de trois études de cas qui documentent la manière dont j'ai repoussé les limites de mes propres pratiques d'interprète, grâce à plusieurs collaborations. Ces études de cas sont:1. Aphasia-Dialogue (2014) par M. Applebaum (cor. par D. Espinosa) 2. 150pF for body capacitance (2014) par H. Morales et D. Espinosa 3. Six Drawings by Randall (2012) par D. Adamcyk et D. Espinosa Ces oeuvres élargissent le répertoire de la multi-percussion soliste. Par la création de nouveaux instruments et de nouvelles techniques, elles amplifient les possibilités que présente le corps performant à devenir un instrument polyvalent, à la croisée de différentes disciplines artistiques: la musique, les arts visuels et la danse.</description><description>Solo multi-percussion is conventionally defined as a single person playing two or more percussion instruments. It was established as a specialized discipline at the end of the 1950s. In this paper, I argue that it has since developed into a hybrid discipline as composers and performers alike have pushed the technical and expressive boundaries to embrace the acoustic and the electronic, as well as the potential of dance and the dramatic or conceptual. The complex challenges posed by the repertoire are explored under three headings: sonic and physical organization, gesture, and rapid mastery. The paper then presents the results of three contrasting case studies that document how I have pushed the boundaries of performance practice in my work through different composer collaborations. The case studies are: 1. Aphasia-Dialogue (2014) by M. Applebaum (chor. by D. Espinosa) 2. 150pF for body capacitance (2014) by H. Morales and D. Espinosa 3. Six Drawings by Randall (2012) by D. Adamcyk and D. Espinosa These works expand the solo multi-percussion repertoire. Through the creation of new instruments and techniques, the works also heighten the possibilities of the performing body as a multi-faceted instrument that cuts across different artistic disciplines—music, the visual arts, and dance.</description><creator>González, Diego Espinosa Cruz</creator><contributor>Ferguson, Sean (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2014</date><subject>Music and technology.</subject><subject>Academic theses.</subject><subject>Performance art.</subject><subject>Percussion instruments -- Performance.</subject><title>The Expanding Solo Multi-Percussionist: The Performing Body Within Music and Beyond</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1c18dj478.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fj2365032</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Music</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Schulich School of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qf85nd988</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:49:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Les oeuvres classiques contemporaines qui comblent le fossé entre la musique classique et rock peuvent le faire en incluant des éléments rock. Ceci est généralement vu d’un mauvais oeil, car les compositeurs de musique classique contemporaine sont encouragés à écrire des oeuvres abstraites, sortant de la norme et opposée à tout ce qu’ils avaient entendu auparavant. Mais si les compositeurs incluent des éléments rock dans leurs oeuvres, il devient important de pouvoir reconnaitre et catégoriser ceux-ci afin que l’interprétation puisse être juste et éclairée. Cette thèse propose d’étudier l’intégration de quelques éléments rock choisis dans deux oeuvres contemporaines classiques pour clavier: « Keyboard Triptych » par Steven Gellman pour synthétiseur et piano, 1 joueur, et « Piano Sonata No. 1 » par Kris Becker. Les artistes désirant explorer ce sujet pourront utiliser cette thèse comme guide, qui les dissuadera de suivre, aveuglément, seulement la route des éléments classiques pour obtenir un portrait complet de la musique.</description><description>Contemporary classical pieces that bridge the divide between classical and rock can do so with the inclusion of various rock elements. Inclusion of these elements has been generally frowned upon, as modern classical composers are encouraged to write music that is abstract, bizarre, and different from anything heard before. When composers do include rock elements in their music, it is important to be able to recognize and categorize these elements for an informed interpretation. This study examines the inclusion of selected rock elements in two contemporary classical keyboard pieces: Steven Gellman’s “Keyboard Triptych” for synthesizer and piano, 1 player, and Kris Becker’s “Piano Sonata No. 1”. The study serves as a guide for other performers exploring other rock-influenced works for a more complete picture of the music, discouraging blind focus solely on classical elements.</description><creator>Krowicki, Marek</creator><contributor>Hashimoto, Kyoko (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Biamonte, Nicole (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Stubley, Eleanor (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Laimmon, Sara (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2015</date><subject>Music -- 21st century -- Analysis, appreciation.</subject><subject>Musical analysis.</subject><subject>Rock music -- Analysis, appreciation.</subject><subject>Music -- 20th century -- Analysis, appreciation.</subject><title>Contemporary Rock Formations: Rock Elements in Classical Music</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3x816q33v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qf85nd988</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Music</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Schulich School of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sj1394917</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:49:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Certain significant factors in the hydro electric industry of Canada emphasize the importance of this industry and the part it plays in the nation's domestic and industrial life.

The suggested explanation may be summarised thus: hypothesis (i) During the transfer process corpuscles and electromagnetic waves both exist, but the energy resides solely in the corpuscles. Hypothesis (ii) The presence of the electromagnetic fieldinvolves a distortion of space-time, and the patbstaken by the corpuscles are determined by the condition that they must correspond to geodesics in this distorted spacetime.

The success achieved in the treatment of gold ores by all-slime cyaniding processes has probably been the great factor in discouraging their concentration by flotation.It is always the plant-operator's ambition to increase the efficiency of his plant if the cost of extraction of gold from its ores can be reduced by a change in treatment from a long-proved, successful one, to a newer, but probably more economical one, then its experimentation is warranted.

At this time monks came to England and brought with them a large number of Greek manuscripts among which were poems of Homer. Schools for the study of Greek were founded and also libraries well stored with Greek books. Bede relates that five bishops in his time had mastered Greek, but there is no trace of its influence in extant Anglo-Saxon literature. John Scotus Erigena, sometime between 800 and 815 A.D., concentrated on the Greeks and his works conclusively prove his familiarity with Aristotle, Plato and the Neo-Platonists.

It should be added that to be 'insurance', the method used must be on an actuarial basis, although it need not be contributory. There are four main emergencies which Social Insurance is designed to provide against, namely: industrial accidents, sickness, unemployment and an impecunious old age. I shall in this monograph deal, first, with the theoretical aspect of Social Insurance, and, secondly, with the application of the principles to Canadian conditions. I shall limit the subject matter to a discussion of Workmen's Compensation, National Health Insurance, and Unemployment Insurance.

In the first place, we may study the structure of the muscle itself, and the mechanics of its operation. Secondly, we may study the energy supply of the muscle, its source, and the manner in which it is made available. Our knowledge of the energy supply of the muscle has developed to the extent, that, in al1 probability, we know more or the reactions taking place in the muscle cells than of those in any other cells of animal tissue.

It is true, however, that there are no organized schools among primitive peoples, but nevertheless there is education; schools were not necessary because education was largely incidental; in fact, education and living were almost synonymous. Any special training that had to be given was in the hands of the priest, medicine man, or tribal chief, but such training was of short duration and consisted mainly of an initiation ceremony given at puberty. As time went on the amount of specialised knowledge increased to such an extent that the communication of this knowledge was entrusted to one special person, the teacher. The child now had two types of education, the informal arid the formal. Until the Industrial Revolution informal education played an important part in every child's life, while formal education played a relatively unimportant part.
