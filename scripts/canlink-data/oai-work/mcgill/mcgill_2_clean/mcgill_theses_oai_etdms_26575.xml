Specifically, eight Peewee hockey coaches followed the same procedures and implemented the same physical team building activities with their teams throughout the regular season. Data was gathered in a variety of ways. Coaches' answered questions on a pre and post-intervention form for each activity and their behaviors were observed by members of the research team. As well, a semi-structured exit interview was conducted with each coach following the completion of the regular season. Cote, Salmela, and Russell's (1995) guidelines were used to inductively analyze and interpret the interview data. Results of the data revealed four higher-order categories concerning coaches' perceptions of the team building program: (a) coach characteristics and outcomes, which included skills coaches gained as a result of their participation in the team building program, as well as their beliefs, philosophies, and background experiences that shaped their coaching development, (b) team circumstances and climate, which involved interpersonal interactions, internal and external environmental factors, and elements influencing team atmosphere, (c) athlete outcomes, which included the feelings, attitudes, and values, as well as the intellectual/thinking-related skills and outcomes that athletes experienced as a result of their involvement in the intervention program, and (d) program involvement and assessment, which focused on coaches' roles and their confidence delivering team building activities, as well as their appraisal of the intervention program. Results of this study provided evidence of the benefits of a season-long team building intervention program for coaches, athletes, and entire teams. Specifically, coaches felt athletes enjoyed this experience and improved and/or acquired a variety of important life skills, such as problem-solving and the ability to focus and persevere when faced with challenging tasks. Likewise, coaches felt their communication and motivational skills improved as a result of their involvement in the team building program. Finally, coaches also felt athletes bonded daring activities and improved their abilities to work together as a group. The results of this study have advanced knowledge in sport psychology by providing a deeper understanding of how team building is perceived by youth sport coaches.</description><creator>Newin, Julie.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Sports -- Psychological aspects.</subject><subject>Hockey -- Coaching.</subject><title>Youth ice hockey coaches' perceptions of the effectiveness of a team building intervention program</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Julie Newin, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dn39x1756.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4f16c305v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p8418n46q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:22:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis examines three different collections from the early works of the Russian writer Aleksei Remizov (1887-1957): Posolon' (1907), Leimonarion (1907), and Besnovatye: Savva Grudtsyn and Solomoniia (1951). Each of them highlights a different approach taken by Remizov in preserving Russianness. In this analysis the concept of Russianness does not constitute a specific national or historical scheme. The reference is rather to a spiritual legacy, a condition of soul. Posolon' calls for the regaining of a lost cyclicity and looks back in time at the common folk's way of life. Leimonarion is one of the most expressive examples of the constant duality of Remizov's position on the dominant artistic and ideological ideas of the time; this collection looks at the old world through the new eyes of a modern era. "Savva Grudtsyn" and "Solomoniia" present a perpetual moral struggle, which pits the profanity of a secular world against the sacred values to which people ought to aspire. The results of the study show that Remizov, using different themes and different literary genres, pursues one broad concern: Russianness. This theme permeates not only his literary language, but also the content of the works discussed here. In Leimonarion Russia is kept together by her people and their belief in salvation; in Posolon' Russia is all about folklore, joyful games, tales and rituals; in Besnovatye Russia is saved by the simplicity and purity of the iurodivye , the 'Holy fools.'</description><creator>Mot, Magdalena.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Remizov, Alekseĭ, 1877-1957 -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><subject>National characteristics, Russian, in literature.</subject><title>Russianness in Aleksei Remizov's early writings</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Magdalena Mot, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qv33rw922.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p8418n46q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Russian and Slavic Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rr171x49j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:22:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Delhi Secondary School is a public school with approximately 6,000 students; 300 teachers, 6 administrators, and countless headmistresses and support staff. It claims that its admissions policy is non-discriminatory, boasting that it admits students from all castes, religions and genders. Ethnographic tools, participant observation, and interview were used to discover how Delhi Secondary School supports religious plurality within their educational community as advertised on their web site, specifically how the music specialist teachers in Delhi Secondary School recognize students' religious diversity in their music curriculum. Analysis of my field notes, interviews, transcripts, photographs and other documents revealed that Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain and Catholic religions were represented in the devotional music that was studied and performed by the students. These findings suggest that the school supports religious plurality through participation and acceptance of spiritual acts during lessons, morning assemblies, concert performances and other daily activities. I conclude that the study and performance of diverse devotional music has important social and musical functions in Delhi Secondary School.</description><creator>Mutter, Morgan L.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Religious pluralism -- India -- Delhi -- Case studies.</subject><subject>Music -- Instruction and study -- India -- Delhi -- Case studies.</subject><subject>Multiculturalism -- India -- Delhi -- Case studies.</subject><subject>School music -- Instruction and study -- India -- Delhi -- Case studies.</subject><title>Delhi Secondary School as a temple of worship : musical choices and devotional diversity</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Morgan L.

Controversially, the South African media has paid great attention to violence against white farmers amidst a seemingly endless flood of violence against black farm workers. The now commonplace tales of farm attacks incite racial tension and provoke paranoia, leading one to question why they are repeated at all. Recent works by South African authors have engaged this question, including Jonny Steinberg's Midlands (2002), J. M. Coetzee's Disgrace (1999), and Breyten Breytenbach's Dog Heart (1998). Critics have accused these works of perpetuating racism with their grim depictions of black-on-white violence but have failed to recognize the manner in which these authors contextualize the violence. I argue that each work registers the farm attack as a land claim, made in an era of failed land reform. Furthermore, these works reflexively explore the pragmatics of circulating the stories.</description><creator>Moth, Laura Eisabel.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>South African literature -- 20th century -- History and criticism.</subject><subject>Land reform -- South Africa.</subject><subject>Violence in literature.</subject><title>Taking back the promised land : farm attacks in recent South African literature</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Laura Eisabel Moth, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0z708w771.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c821gk02r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8s45q917m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:22:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis investigates early sixteenth-century motet settings of texts taken from the Song of Songs. By way of contextualization, I will explore the Christian history of Song of Songs exegesis from the third century to the twelfth. I will also consider generic properties of the renaissance motet---contemporary definitions of the genre, performance context, types of texts used, and repertory dissemination---and make a case that both the Song of Songs and the motet occupy a sort of "intermediate" position between the secular and the sacred world, participating in both the earthly and the spiritual. Several motets---Tota pulchra es by Ludwig Senfl, Tota pulchra es by Nicolaus Craen, Nigra sum sed formosa by Johannis Lheritier, and the anonymous Vulnerasti cor meum from Petrucci's Motetti de la Corona I print---will be analyzed through the lens of the historical Christian exegesis and generic considerations of the motet. I interpret diverse musical parameters---among them, texture, quotation of pre-existent material, motivic structuring, cadential manipulation, mode and modal commixture---as some of the ways in which the composers responded to their Song of Songs texts.</description><creator>Chiu, Remi.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Motets -- 16th century -- Analysis and appreciation.</subject><subject>Motets -- 16th century -- History and criticism.</subject><subject>Song of Solomon (Music) -- Criticism, interpretation, etc.</subject><title>Motet settings of the Song of Songs ca. 1500-1520</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Remi Chiu, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k35694749.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8s45q917m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Schulich School of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k35694731</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:22:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Neighbourhood trade-stores, or small scale retail outlets specialising in domestic provisions sold in small quantities, are common features of residential landscapes in developing countries. While these shops are fixtures in the everyday micro-geographies of urban places, little is known as to how they are economically and socially bound up with the neighbourhoods in which they are situated and, in turn, how these linkages influence the day-to-day life circumstances of local people. Through such a local-level investigation utilising multiple qualitative methods, I examine the intra-neighbourhood economic and social roles of small trade-stores in an urban neighbourhood in Cochabamba, Bolivia. My analysis reveals that trade-stores were a key influence on the welfare of neighbourhood residents. Economically, these shops functioned as safeguards for family economies by providing multidimensional material support. Socially, trade-stores acted as mechanisms for informal social control, nodes of local information exchange, and sources of local social opportunities and social support.</description><creator>Coen, Stephanie E.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Cochabamba (Bolivia) -- Economic conditions.</subject><subject>Cochabamba (Bolivia) -- Social conditions.</subject><subject>Neighborhoods -- Bolivia -- Cochabamba.</subject><subject>Convenience stores -- Bolivia -- Cochabamba.</subject><title>Economic and social dimensions of neighbourhood trade-stores in Cochabamba, Bolivia</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Stephanie E.

The first part, titled Cul sec, consists of five short stories revolving around the themes of alcohol and inebriation. These short stories contain characters having different relations to alcohol, be they negative or positive. The goal of this creation wasn't to explain or identify causes of alcohol consumption, but rather to build atmospheres and to expose various behaviours related to alcohol. Our characters also distinguish themselves for their passiveness, particularly regarding some problems they have to face. The second part of the thesis is a character study of Antoine in Andre Major's Winter of a Heart. More specifically, it is an analysis of the interior conflict he lives between his desire for a woman and an old romantic ideal of solitariness, conflict that will alter the apparent passiveness of the character and that will influence his work as a writer.</description><creator>Charette, Nicolas.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Major, André.

He distinguishes two kinds of love corresponding to each one of these possibilities, love of the world (cupiditas) and love of God (caritas), and proceeds to analyze these loves. The main argument of the thesis is that these loves disclose the world to man in two opposed manners. The author argues that cupiditas seeks to find satisfaction in the creation and discloses it as an end in itself, whereas caritas loves the world for the sake of God and discloses it as a means to attaining God.</description><creator>Collins, Joshua.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Love -- Religious aspects -- Catholic Church.</subject><subject>Augustine, Saint, Bishop of Hippo.

A factor analysis of the combined measurements has revealed 3 factors, accounting for 70% of the variability. They were interpreted as cognitive ability (eigenvalue=4.3), cautiousness (eigenvalue=2.1) and impulsive responding (eigenvalue=1.3). No association was found between the DRD4 VNTR alleles and impulsive responding (F1,93 =0.082, p=0.775). The smallest and youngest within this sample of young adults have been found to display the most cautious behavior (p=0.002). The heaviest subjects displayed the most uninhibited response-style (p=0.045). And lastly, monkeys with cognitive difficulties had the highest CSF levels of the dopamine metabolite, HVA (p=0.017). The ORT and TRAIT provide rapid screening measures of cognitive ability, cautiousness and impulsive-responding, but extensive validation of these measures with classical cognitive tests was beyond the scope of this project. The relationship between cognitive performance and resting levels of dopamine metabolites suggests that the battery may be useful in future studies of various psychopathological models in this species.</description><creator>Djivré, Ilan-Alan.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Biology, Genetics.</subject><title>Cognitive testing and analysis of the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) exon III polymorphism and CSF metabolites in male African green monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Ilan-Alan Djivré, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sq87bt826.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h128nf057</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Human Genetics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:37720d05f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:22:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>While acculturation is among the most popular concepts in cultural psychiatry and psychology, the conceptualization and measurement of this construct continue to be issues of significant debate. Recent literature supports the development of multidimensional models of acculturation, in contrast to traditional linear or unidimensional models. The current study examined a multidimensional model of acculturation in a multi-ethnic community sample of first-generation immigrants in Montreal. Two cultural orientations - Canadian and Self-Defined Ethnicity - were assessed independently among Caribbean (n=109), Vietnamese (n=97), and Filipino (n=109) participants. These two cultural orientations were examined across three dimensions of acculturation: ethnic loyalty, ethnic behaviour, and situational ethnic identity. Correlational and factor analysis were used to assess the distinctiveness of the three dimensions, and the relationship between the two cultural orientations. For ethnic behaviour and situational ethnic identity, the two cultural orientations were not related to one another. Among the Vietnamese and Filipino groups, loyalty to one's self-defined ethnic group was positively related to loyalty towards Canadians. Factor analysis revealed two independent components, corresponding to the two cultural orientations. Overall, results support both the need to assess cultural orientations independently, and the multidimensional nature of acculturation.</description><creator>Dere, Jessica.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Psychology, Social.</subject><subject>Sociology, Ethnic and Racial Studies.</subject><title>Examining the multidimensional nature of acculturation in a multi-ethnic community sample of first-generation immigrants</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Jessica Dere, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8336h2246.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/37720d05f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Social and Transcultural Psychiatry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7w62f846f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:22:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The main goal of this study was to evaluate the utility of physical activity (PA) measurement in an Inuit population with a self-administered questionnaire. The objective was to validate a culturally relevant physical activity questionnaire that measures Inuit PA levels. To do this, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was evaluated against the Caltrac accelerometer and anthropometric/physiologic measurements. There were a number of compliance problems encountered when implementing the Caltrac in the pilot community which resulted in too few Caltrac scores available for analyses. However, IPAQ PA score (N=44) was significantly inversely related to Body Mass Index (p≤0.05) and positively related to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p≤0.03). The results indicate that the IPAQ has potential but needs further refinements to be acceptable to Inuit populations and needs re-evaluation in a larger sample. The participants found it very difficult to remember the time spent performing each activity and, in general, the IPAQ was not well received.</description><creator>Dénommé, Daneen.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Questionnaires.</subject><subject>Exercise -- Health aspects -- Nunavut -- Baffin Island.</subject><subject>Inuit -- Nunavut -- Baffin Island.</subject><subject>Exercise -- Measurement.</subject><title>Physical activity validation pilot project in Inuit of the Baffin region</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Daneen Dénommé, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8w32r590n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7w62f846f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0r967396x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:22:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a composite of conditions that include an abnormal inflammatory response and emphysema. Cigarette smoking is the main risk factor for developing COPD and mouse models are widely used in the study of smoking induced emphysema. The C57BL/6 mouse strain develops airspace enlargement after chronic smoke exposure, with no change in lung mechanics. The broad objective of this thesis is to try to identify in mice, candidate genes that cause a difference in susceptibility to the development of the disease and to better understand the inflammatory process that occurs in response to smoke exposure. A detailed introduction to COPD and proposed mechanisms of its pathophysiology are presented in Chapter I. Chapter II consists of a manuscript containing data comparing the genetic expression profiles and inflammation in lung tissue of mice (C57BL/6) chronically exposed to cigarette smoke, with age-paired controls.

Methods . A hospital chart review of randomly selected patient files was undertaken. Comparisons were made between patients who were maintained on the same antipsychotic versus those who were switched or initiated on polypharmacy for socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, and psychiatric services utilized during the two year study period. Results. Eleven per cent (n=23) of the included patients (N=201) experienced a switch, and 11 % (n=22) had another antipsychotic added to their treatment. A history of recent psychiatric hospitalizations and secondary diagnoses of personality disorders were more common among switched and add-on patients than maintenance group patients. During the study period, significantly more switched and add-on patients used outpatient, emergency and inpatient psychiatric services than maintained patients. Conclusions. Patients whose antipsychotic treatment was changed had likely been experiencing clinically significant problems for which a change was implemented. The high rate of study service use indicates that these problems were conserved despite changes in antipsychotic medications.</description><creator>Schneider, Andrea L.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Psychology, Clinical.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Mental Health.</subject><title>Switching antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia : a two-year comparison of patient characteristics and psychiatric service use</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Andrea L.

Seniors are at risk of declining nutritional status as they age. We investigated medical, psychological, social and environmental characteristics as both predictors and correlates of elevated nutritional risk in community-dwelling seniors using data from a prospective study of 839 seniors aged 75 and over, in Montreal. At baseline, more than half (59%) of the participants were at elevated nutritional risk. Cross-sectional analyses supported the findings of previous research examining correlates of elevated nutritional risk. Longitudinal results showed that amongst those at low nutritional risk, only poor self-rated health was found to be a statistically significant predictor of elevated risk at 12-months (OR=3.30, p&lt;0.05). The findings of this research highlight the need for longitudinal studies in order to better understand and target nutritional risk in community-dwelling seniors.</description><creator>Roberts, Karen C.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</subject><subject>Gerontology.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Nutrition.</subject><title>Predictors of nutritional risk in community-dwelling seniors</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Karen C.

In this study, characteristics of orthogonal bremsstrahlung photons produced by megavoltage electron beams were studied and their suitability for radiotherapy imaging was evaluated. Orthogonal bremsstrahlung beams with kilovoltage effective energies can be obtained from megavoltage electrons striking low atomic number targets. A 10 MeV electron beam emerging out of the research port of a Varian Clinac-18 linac was made to strike carbon, aluminum and copper targets. Percentage depth dose and attenuation measurements of forward and orthogonal beams were performed, and experimental results were compared with Monte Carlo-calculated findings. Images of simple contrast objects taken using the orthogonal bremsstrahlung beams showed superior contrast levels in comparison to those produced by the forward beams.</description><creator>Sarfehnia, Arman.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Biophysics, Medical.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Radiology.</subject><subject>Physics, Radiation.</subject><title>The use of orthogonal bremsstrahlung beams for imaging in radiation therapy /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Arman Sarfehnia, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fj236230b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3r074v348</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zp38wc90p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:22:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The analysis in this thesis is motivated by two models in the literature. Dong and Atick [4] describe the relationship between spatial and temporal frequencies of videos of natural scenes. Langer and Mann [10] describe a geometric constraint on the power spectrum of individual image sequences produced by an observer moving laterally relative to a cluttered 3D scene. Langer and Mann's model proposes a bowtie pattern in the frequency domain, but does not consider the distribution of power within this bowtie. In this thesis we consider the distribution of power within the bowtie by applying the model of Dong and Atick. The model predicts a spreading of power away from the bowtie axis, and a bias of power towards low speeds. Using synthetic image sequences, we verify both of these predictions. Other contributing factors are discussed including occlusion, transparency and the distribution of objects over different depths in the scene.</description><creator>Rivait, Derek.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Three dimensional power spectra of motion parallax in cluttered three dimensional scenes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Derek Rivait, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sf2685403.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zp38wc90p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qz20ss75n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:22:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The following thesis deals with three current legal issues regarding airports. In the first chapter the development of airport ownership and management structures will be studied. Although in most cases airports are still owned and managed by governments or local bodies, since the 1960s, new approaches to ownership and management have come into practise. This phenomenon is studied from the perspective of its impact upon public air law. The second chapter deals with airport charges and their international legal framework. After examining the different forms of airport charges and the recommendations enacted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the author will be led to the conclusion that the current legal regime is unsatisfactory and that the most appropriate solution to this would be to incorporate the principles formulated by ICAO in an Annex to the Chicago Convention. The third and final chapter is devoted to the study of a legal dispute between Switzerland and Germany with respect to the approach paths to Zurich airport through German airspace. It is concluded that the unilateral legal measures taken by the German government are, with one exception, in conformity with international law.</description><creator>Hartmann, Cyril.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Airport zoning -- Germany.</subject><subject>Airports -- Law and legislation.</subject><subject>Airports -- Landing fees.</subject><title>Aéroports : quelques enjeux juridiques actuels</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Cyril Hartmann, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b2773v987.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qz20ss75n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q237hs20z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:22:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Sets and the Senses is a work for symphony orchestra that bears the interaction between science and art as its overriding theme. Formalizations of compositional parameters that relate to this interaction are established, in particular those relating to the contrast between systematic and intuitively composed music, in order to provide a vehicle for musical communication on the theme. A summary of scientific and artistic elements of the compositional process reveals in the work an ingrained hierarchy of science/art interactions. Specific strategies for manipulating the science/art parameters are described. Genetic algorithms as applied to computer-assisted composition are discussed.

The piece features certain sounds of British Columbia---birds, animals, wind, water, machinery, and folksong; their musical depictions represent a growing interest of mine, one which was expanded significantly in this piece. The primary goal of the thesis is a close interconnection of all musical material, at all levels; that a limited pool of material could produce, through motivic development, all the components of the piece, from small to large. The secondary goal is to give the music a "sense of place" through depictions of natural sounds occurring---in this case---in British Columbia. The tertiary goal is to write musical returns, or recapitulations, that are always significantly altered from their original presentations, to give the piece a feeling of consequence or alteration. This last goal arises from the aesthetic application of some of the composer's philosophical beliefs.</description><creator>Johnson, Stephen.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Orchestral music.</subject><subject>Orchestral music -- Analysis, appreciation.</subject><title>Hecate nocturne : for large orchestra</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Stephen Johnson, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kd17ct17h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1v53jx27f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Music</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:st74cq751</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:22:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Neural tube defect is one of the leading causes of birth defect in human.

The situation clearly calls for corrective action in the form of a normative framework of effective regulations. Such a regulatory framework must needs to be enforced by a respected and dynamic international organization. Our research on this topic leads us to believe that the International Labour Organization (ILO) would be in an excellent position to supervise a proactive strategy of this kind, directly or indirectly, as it has the political clout and history to compel multinational corporations to respect their workers' most basic rights. In order to establish our case, we examine the legal questions at stake in this case study. In particular, we address the key attributes of multinational corporations, the issue of territorial sovereignty, the tripartite system, and the need for national legislation in any strategy involving workers' rights vis-a-vis multinational corporations. Next, we summarize the current level of accountability that multinational corporations have to their cross-border labour force. We then go on to discuss the ILO, the organization at the core of our reflections on multinational corporations' current (lack of) workplace accountability. Our research leads us to conclude that the ILO has not only the power to play that role, but also the duty to do so.</description><creator>Tremblay, Simon, 1979-</creator><date>2006</date><subject>International Labour Organisation.</subject><subject>Labor laws and legislation.</subject><subject>International business enterprises -- Law and legislation.</subject><title>L'OIT et la responsabilisation extraterritoriale des états pour encadrer les activités des entreprises multinationales</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Simon Tremblay, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z603qx74s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d0053</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:tt44pn16q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:22:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Transport of oil or other hazardous substances by sea constitutes the backbone of the world economy. The fiscal benefits and dependence on the transport of oil and other substances by sea outweigh the dangers associated with the carriage of such substances by sea, especially the pollution of the marine environment. Although the absolute answer for the protection of the marine environment may be to prohibit the harm-producing activities altogether, and to turn to alternative energy-resources, it seems very unlikely that this will be the case in the near future. The feasible solution for the protection and preservation of the marine environment and safe marine transport calls for a liberal approach that redistributes these responsibilities amongst all the related interests. In this respect, this thesis examines the issue of places of refuge, as a measure to protect and preserve the marine environment, and the position in international law on the obligation to grant refuge to ships in distress. It is argued that the obligation to grant refuge, founded in early customary international law and denounced in current international documents, can be reformulated in an environmental context.</description><creator>Ucar, Zeynep.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Maritime law.</subject><subject>Marine pollution.</subject><subject>Harbors of refuge.</subject><title>Places of refuge and the obligation to accommodate ships in distress</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Zeynep Ucar, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9019s2753.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tt44pn16q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zs25x890x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:22:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>I address the problem of the lack of academic attention to evidentiary issues in Honduras in comparison to Common Law Countries. I feel that Honduran law students need to be taught a working scheme to deal with issues of admissibility and weight of evidence in order to achieve the rational determination of facts. Moreover, I draw such a scheme from the conceptual basis for admission of evidence and the probative processes identified by Wigmore. I think that if this scheme were applied to trial records, academicians would identify problems in the admission and weight of evidence and would develop approaches to make reason and justice prevail. The scheme is presented in the form of a chart and because it is adapted to the Honduran context I consider that it will have a positive effect on academic research, theorization and teaching of issues of admission and weight of evidence in Honduras.</description><creator>Vargas, Erick Rodolfo.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Evidence (Law) -- Great Britain.</subject><subject>Evidence (Law) -- Honduras.</subject><subject>Evidence (Law) -- United States.</subject><title>The Anglo American academic attitude towards the field of judicial evidence and its usefulness to rational fact finding in Honduras /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Erick Rodolfo Vargas, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8049g542w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zs25x890x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:70795800q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:22:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In spite of the general prohibition of the use of force in international relations contained in the UN Charter, some jurists maintain that humanitarian intervention is valid under comtemporary international law. Too make their case, they put forward a series of arguments which can be divided into two categories. The first holds that humanitarian intervention is compatible with the UN Charter, and the second, which is used more often, that a right of humanitarian intervention has arise out of state's practice. The present thesis surveys these arguments and comes to the conclusion that humanitarian intervention remains illegal under international law. Notwithstanding the formidable progression of human rights in international society, the rule prohibiting recourse to force still enjoys great currency among states at the beginning of this new millenium.</description><creator>Villeneuve, François, 1974-</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Nonviolence.</subject><subject>Human rights.</subject><subject>Humanitarian intervention.</subject><title>La légalité de l'intervention humanitaire en droit international : entre la non-violence et le respect des droits de l'homme</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© François Villeneuve, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pc289j289.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/70795800q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:m613mx85j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:22:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Numerical methods of analysis such as the finite element method and finite difference method have seen increasing use in recent years as tools for geomechanical mine design to predict problems of ground caving and failure. As a result of recent advances in computer technology, it is now possible to handle large-scale problems involving complex material and geometric nonlinearities at an affordable computational cost. The scope of this study is the stability of underground mine haulage drifts associated with sublevel stoping method with delayed backfill. This is one of the most popular mining methods today in Canadian underground metal mines. In this method, blasted ore is mucked with load-haul-dump vehicles and transported to the nearest dump through a nearby haulage drift. Therefore, it is crucial in a mining operation that a haulage drift remains functional during the life of the stope. This study is focused on studying the interaction between the haulage drift and nearby mining activity. The stability of the haulage drift is examined through a detailed parametric study of a finite element model representing typical mining layout most commonly adopted in Canadian underground metal mines. The model parametric study examines the influence of critical factors such as the stope mining sequences, mining depth and the distance between the stope and the haulage drift. The model is set up for nonlinear behaviour of the rock mass taking into account elastoplasticity of the rock mass and non-associated plasticity using Mohr Coulomb and Drucker Prager yield functions. Stability indicators are defined in terms of displacement, stress and the extent of yield zones. These indicators serve as a basis for assessing the effect of different parameters on the stability of the haulage drift. From the model parametric study, it is found that stope mining causes a lateral movement of the entire drift. The severity of such movement is increased with shorter distance between the stope and haulage drift. Of all mining sequences examined, same-level mining is the most critical step. It is also found that more yield zones develop around the haulage drift as the mining depth increases and as distance between haulage drift and the stope decreases. A 3-centre arc drift is compared with a rectangular one of the same cross sectional area. It is found that the 3-centre arc drift shape is more stable. This study also demonstrates that the nonlinear elastoplastic analysis gives more realistic results than traditional linear elastic analysis in terms of stress and displacement behaviour of the haulage drift.</description><creator>Zhang, Yaohua, 1963-</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Engineering, Mining.</subject><title>Nonlinear rock mass behaviour and application to stability of underground haulage drift</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Yaohua Zhang, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vx021f456.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m613mx85j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):26600</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
