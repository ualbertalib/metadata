These solutions are obtained using an especially developed method based on velocity singularities associated with the airfoil leading edge and ridges, which define the changes in the airfoil boundary conditions. The velocity singularity method has been initially developed by Mateescu. Closed form solutions are presented for the unsteady lift and pitching moment coefficients and for the chordwise distribution of the unsteady pressure difference coefficient in the general case of rigid airfoils executing oscillatory pitching rotations and translations, as well as for flexible airfoils executing flexural oscillations. For the case of incompressible flows, the present solutions were found in excellent agreement with the previous incompressible flow results obtained by Theodorsen, Postel &amp; Leppert and by Mateescu &amp; Abdo.</description><creator>Neculita, Catalin Silviu.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Unsteady compressible flows past oscillating airfoils</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Catalin Silviu Neculita, 2005</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/td96k286b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b5644r908</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sq87bt83g</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:03:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Human face detection in gray scale images has been researched extensively over the past decade, due to the recent emergence of applications such as security access control, visual surveillance and content-based information retrieval. However, this problem remains challenging because faces are non-rigid objects that have a high degree of variability in size, shape, color and texture. Indeed, few of the proposed face detection methods have been analyzed for performance under different conditions, such as head rotation, illumination, facial expression, occlusion and aging. Nowadays, most face detection methods are based upon statistical and learning strategies. Many of these appearance-based methods tend to increase data complexity, by mapping it onto a higher-dimensional space in order to extract the predominant features; this, however, often requires much more computational time. A novel technique that is gaining in popularity, known as Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), adopts a different approach to the problem by applying dimensionality-reduction to the data for learning and classification. Proposed by Roweis and Saul, the objective of this method is to determine a locally-linear fit, so that each data point can be represented by a linear combination of its closest neighbors. The first objective of the current research is to apply the LLE algorithm to 2D facial images, so as to obtain their representation in a sub-space under the unfavorable conditions stated above. The low-dimensional data then will be used to train a Support Vector Machine to classify images as being face or non-face. For this research, six different databases of cropped facial images, corresponding to variations in head rotation, illumination, facial expression, occlusion and aging, were built to train and test the classifiers. The second objective is to evaluate the feasibility of using the combined efficacy of the six SVM classifiers in a two-stage face detection approach. Experimental results obtained with image databases demonstrated that the performance of the proposed method was similar to and sometimes better than other face detection methods, introducing a viable and accurate alternative to previously existing techniques.</description><creator>Kadoury, Samuel.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Face detection using locally linear embedding</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Samuel Kadoury, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fj236231m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sq87bt83g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0c483j623</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:03:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Uncontrolled discharges of significant volumes of non-aqueous phase liquids such as petroleum fuels and chlorinated solvents have occurred at many sites. Understanding the fate and transport of NAPLs in the subsurface is necessary for assessing the extent and environmental impacts of the contamination, and its remediation. Temperature changes that cause freeze and thawing of soil moisture can result in the alteration of the soil pore structure, which can induce changes in the distribution and morphology of liquid phases present in soil. This study focuses on the effect of freeze-thaw cycles on the volume distribution, morphology and specific surface area of the NAPLs, gasoline and perchloroethylene (PCE) present at residual saturation in porous media. The volume distribution of NAPL blobs in packed sand columns were characterized using a medical X-ray CT scanner. The results show that gasoline blobs were mobilized to a significantly greater extent than PCE blobs. The morphology of the gasoline blobs such as volume, surface area and fractal dimension were also altered more than PCE blobs as a result of freeze and thaw. The extent of mobilization and morphological changes were a function of the freezing rate.</description><creator>Kashef Haghighi, Sormeh.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Environmental Sciences.</subject><title>Effect of freeze-thaw temperature cycles on the mobility and morphology of residual non-aqueous phase liguids</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Sormeh Kashef Haghighi, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4q77fr64m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0c483j623</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1544bp384</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:03:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A structural model in the frequency domain is developed to obtain aeroelastic solutions of a NACA64A010 in the transonic regime. Results from a fully nonlinear frequency domain flow solver and the structural model are compared to a state of the art time accurate flutter code. The prohibitive cost of using time accurate methods to solve problems in transonic aeroelasticity is introduced and then followed by an analysis of using a Non-Linear Frequency Domain (NLFD) approach. The computational cost and accuracy associated with using the NLFD method are compared with already established time accurate methods. In this work, an accurate representation of the transonic flutter boundary is obtained and compared to pre-existing numerical results, further substantiating the NLFD method's ability to account for strong nonlinearities in the flow field. The flight conditions considered herein are of a swept wing in the transonic regime, a test case extensively studied by Isogai. This research has further validated the NLFD method as an accurate and efficient alternative for computing aeroelastic solutions in the transonic regime.</description><creator>Kachra, Farid.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Engineering, Aerospace.</subject><title>Convergence acceleration to a periodic steady state for aeroelastic simulations</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Farid Kachra, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rf55z805q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1544bp384</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8g84mm54r</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:03:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Road irregularities are a source of structure-borne noise in a car cabin. An active suspension using an Hinfinity robust feedback controller is designed to reduce this vibration-induced noise. To define the control law on this suspension, a quarter-car suspension is first modeled through its resonance modes. Frequency responses are extracted from experimental measurements which are then curve-fitted to obtain the nominal model of the suspension and its parametric uncertainty. The vibration-induced noise in the frequency range 60-250 Hz is then reduced using robust feedback controllers. An Hinfinity controller and two mu-synthesis controllers are designed and compared. Simulation of these controllers using Simulink result in a reduction in vibration at resonance peaks of up to 31 dB.</description><creator>Jolicoeur, Marie-Pierre.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Model identification of a car suspension testbed for robust vibration control</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Marie-Pierre Jolicoeur, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1544bp39d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8g84mm54r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x059c7664</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:03:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis presents a novel approach to increasing the accuracy and robustness of 3D scene geometry estimates based on two 2D images of the same scene. Our approach focuses on finding feature correspondences, i.e. matching similar features between 2 images and estimating the fundamental matrix (FM), which is a key component to understanding scene geometry given two views. The accuracy of the fundamental matrix is acutely related to the number and accuracy of the correspondences. Determining point correspondences is a difficult and open research problem because many features are not robust enough to handle changes in illumination, scale, and viewpoint. As a result, there may be an insufficient number of correspondences present to estimate the fundamental matrix. Furthermore, if the FM can be estimated, it may not be accurate enough for the required task. Invariant features have been introduced in the literature to model local geometry in such a way that they are capable of being matched over more disparate changes of illumination, viewpoint, and scale. However, cases still exist where an insufficient number of correspondences are present to be able to estimate the fundamental matrix properly. In order to address this problem, we therefore introduce the Transfer of Invariant Parameters (TIP) as a new technique that will exploit the informative geometric parameters stored in several popular classes of invariant features in order to generate additional point correspondences. We anticipate that the addition of a small number of these points for each match will greatly reduce errors in the fundamental matrix estimate and permit its computation in contexts where there are an insufficient number of matches found. In addition, we present modifications to an existing RANSAC robust estimator to better exclude outliers. We demonstrate our approach with two of the most popular scale and affine invariant feature detectors. We test our methods on real images of 3D scenes and show that, with the inclusion of TIP points, it is possible to estimate the FM with fewer than seven corresponding features while still using standard estimation approaches. The resulting estimates also show that with the inclusion of additional TIP point correspondences, the average residual error is lower, fewer estimates are deemed catastrophic failures, and epipole locations are found to be more stable when compared to standard FM estimates.</description><creator>Riggi, Frank Peter.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Robust invariant feature correspondence for scene geometry estimates</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Frank Peter Riggi, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p5547r65p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x059c7664</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:44558d616</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:03:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The thermal plasma production of fumed silica in a transferred arc consists of the decomposition of quartz to SiO (g) and oxygen followed by an oxidizing quench back to SiO2. The particles formed have diameters of the order of 10 to 20 nm and are linked in a three dimensional branched chain aggregate. Previous work by Addona and Munz (1999) demonstrated the technical feasibility of producing fumed silica using this method, but was unable to demonstrate the special rheological properties of the powder. The most important characteristic of fumed silica is the presence of hydroxyls on the surface of the particles, in the form of isolated hydroxyl groups, hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl groups and siloxane groups. In the present work, we studied the changes in the powder quality by varying the quench conditions used for the production of the powder and by agglomerating the obtained particles. The fumed silica was agglomerated by conveying in a length of tubing with sharp bends. The powder was characterized using BET, Viscosity tests, FT-IR, TEM, SEM and XRD. The product was compared to both a commercial product (Aerosil 200) and the material previously produced by Addona. Tests were done before and after the agglomeration experiments. The experimental results showed that the agglomeration had no effect on the powder's rheological properties. We concluded that the smaller viscosity values obtained for the plasma produced fumed silica were due to the lack of the free hydroxyl groups from the surface of the particles.</description><creator>Pristavita, Ramona</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Silica fume.</subject><subject>Plasma arc melting.</subject><title>Transferred arc production of fumed silica : rheological properties</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Ramona Pristavita, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dz010q31t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/44558d616</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fn106z32z</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:03:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Cathode erosion under the action of an electric arc is a major problem in plasma torches. The reduction of cathode erosion through the development of superior cathode materials would result in more economical operation of plasma torches. Carbon nanotubes have favorable electron emission properties; they are studied here for the fabrication of superior cathode materials. In this work, the growth of carbon nanotubes (CNT) using thermal CVD is studied on different metal and metal alloy electrodes. Electroless Ni coated on Monel substrates and Ni deposited Si wafer substrates with 20 nm Cr under layer gave the highest density of CNT growth. Variations of the CNT coverage density was observed when varying the surface roughness on pure Ni and Monel with various degree of polishing prior to the CNT growth. Cupro-Nickel alloys and electroless Ni plated Cu did not show to be favorable for the growth of CNT. Tests on the growth of CNT in a PECVD reactor were not successful; the transport of the carbon precursor to the electrodes still needs further study. Other applications such as the use of the CNT layer as a nanoparticle filter and collector, the formation of a CNT-nanoparticle composite film, the growth of a 3D structure of a multi-branched CNT, and the growth of CNT on alloy meshes were also studied and discussed in this thesis.</description><creator>Reddy, Naveen Krishna.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Study of growth of carbon nonotubes on pure metal and metal alloy electrodes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Naveen Krishna Reddy, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/th83kz56p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fn106z32z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cr56n134j</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:03:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Wet snow accumulating and shedding from overhead transmission lines can lead to a number of serviceability, safety and mechanical reliability issues. An innovative and inexpensive method to reproduce wet snow accretions on a cable in a controlled environment is explained. Wet snow sleeves were experimentally reproduced by using this technique to study their shedding mechanism. A numerical modeling technique using nonlinear finite element analysis is proposed to evaluate the dynamic response of an overhead cable subjected to any snow-shedding scenario. A time function is associated to the mass and weight of each snow element, which enables its virtual removal from the model at the time prescribed by the user. The response of a single span of overhead ground wire subjected to total and partial snow shedding scenarios is evaluated.</description><creator>Roberge, Mathieu.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Overhead electric lines.</subject><subject>Engineering -- Cold weather conditions.</subject><subject>Snow.</subject><title>A study of wet snow shedding from an overhead cable /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Mathieu Roberge, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xs55mc32c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cr56n134j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rr171x46q</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:03:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The present thesis studies the stability of a rotating cylindrical shell containing a co-rotating axial viscous flow. The system can be thought of as a long thin-walled pipe carrying an internal axial flow while the whole is in a frame of reference rotating at a prescribed rate. The equations of the previously solved inviscid model are rederived and the problem is studied further. The results obtained for purely axial flow are reproduced, but as expected from literature, it is impossible to obtain satisfactory results for the system subjected to rotation due to the presence of singularities in the flow pressure solution. A hypothetical physical explanation for these singularities is put forward and has similarities with the phenomenon of atmospheric flow blocking. Considering the unsuccessful results obtained with the inviscid theory, it is believed that the added realism brought in by the introduction of viscosity in the theory can lead to a successful model. Assuming a travelling-wave perturbation scheme, the linear Donnell-Mushtari thin shell equations are coupled with the fluid stresses obtained by solving numerically the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation for a laminar or turbulent flow. A novel triple-perturbation approach is established to consider the interaction between the fluid and the structure. This triple-perturbation approach is in essence a superposition of three fluid fields caused by the three components of the shell deformation for a given oscillation mode. It is found that the usual technique for linear aeroelasticity studies consisting of applying the fluid boundary conditions at the undeformed position of the wall instead of the instantaneous deformed position greatly alters the stability of the system. To remedy to this problem, three different corrections are applied and tested on the carefully derived model. The dynamics of the system subjected to purely axial flow with no rotation is successfully studied with the viscous model for both laminar and turbulent flow conditions. Because no experimental or previous theoretical data is available, it is impossible to validate the results obtained in the laminar regime. For the turbulent regime, as the Reynolds number is increased, the results tend more and more towards those obtained with the inviscid theory. The results obtained for small rates of rotation show that both in the laminar and in the turbulent regime, the system tends to be stabilised when subjected to a small rate of rotation. On the other hand, this tendency should be reversed for higher rates of rotation, but it is impossible to show this due to the limitations of the root-finding method employed.</description><creator>Gosselin, Frédéric.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Applied Mechanics.</subject><title>Stability of a rotating cylindrical shell containing axial viscous flow</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Frédéric Gosselin, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8623hz027.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rr171x46q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:44558d62g</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:03:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Falconbridge Dominicana C. Por A. operating in the Dominican Republic produces nickel as an iron-nickel alloy from laterite ore. Material that is rejected from their mining operations due to its incompatible chemistry is currently being stockpiled against mine depletion. Recent interest in recuperating nickel from this reject material led to the examination of the suitability of carbothermic reduction followed by magnetic separation for nickel recovery from this reject ore. Five parameters were considered in a Design of Experiment framework, namely: heating time; temperature; material type, coke addition and oxygen partial pressure. Magnetic separation was conducted with a Davis Tube and a low intensity hand magnet. It was found that this reject material can successfully be treated using a carbothermic reduction process to produce 50 to 75 mum diameter metallic components within a gangue matrix. The recovery of nickel ranged from 61.7% to 21.9% to 16.4% in the high, low and non magnetic fractions, respectively, separated from the reduced material. The grade of nickel ranged from 1.97 wt% Ni to 1.58% to 0.75 wt% Ni in the high, low and non magnetic fractions, respectively. Heating temperature had the greatest positive influence on the performance of the process followed by material type and heating time. Oxygen activity and coke addition were seen not to influence the performance. The Boudouard reaction was considered to be the rate controlling step and a maximum possible operating temperature was considered to depend on the physical properties of the material, specifically the softening temperature.</description><creator>Goodall, Graeme.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Nickel -- Metallurgy.</subject><subject>Laterite.</subject><title>Nickel recovery from reject laterite</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Graeme Goodall, 2007</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zw12z555k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/44558d62g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mg74qm295</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:03:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>When faced with a new design problem, Engineers most often tend to rely on their accumulated knowledge of science, mathematics, and appropriate experience to reach suitable solutions. Case-Based Reasoning is a new engineering paradigm that reflects this fact by suggesting solutions to novel problems based on the recall and reuse of specific experiences. Such a paradigm relies on previous successful design solutions that are stored in the form of separate cases in a database. The aim of this thesis is to develop a process that will provide examples which can be used to set up a database of optimized designs for various electromagnetic devices such as loudspeakers and actuators. Each stored design will represent an optimum solution to a specific set of requirements for an electromagnetic device. These designs will eventually be used by a case-based reasoning system to reach a solution for possible requested future designs. The process will also involve developing a parameterization of a particular class of devices as well as testing optimization processes to be applied to the initial designs in order to ensure that the solutions stored in the case database represent effective and realistic devices which satisfy the requirements. This thesis also presents test results that illustrate how each optimized design conforms to certain requirements set as an input objective.</description><creator>Hammoud, Samer.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Electromagnetic devices -- Design and construction.</subject><subject>Case-based reasoning.</subject><title>A methodology for developing optimized electromagnetic devices to populate a case-based reasoning system /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Samer Hammoud, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8g84mm51x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mg74qm295</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nk322d48d</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:03:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A 2-D photonic crystal cavity device is investigated in this thesis. A simplified flexible local approximation method (FLAME) is used to analyze the electromagnetic characteristics of the cavity. FLAME is a computational technique that is well suited to problems involving a large number of repeated structures. It has been used before to analyze photonic crystal cavities. In this thesis, an improved FLAME is developed, leading to a standard eigenproblem, which allows the use of sparse-matrix solution methods. Consequently, much larger problems can be solved. In addition, a graded perfectly matched layer (PML) is applied to absorb more effectively the out-going waves. The new method is applied to cavities based on NxN arrays of rods, from N=3 to 9. Good accuracy is achieved compared with the finite-element method (FEM), with an error of less than 0.001% in the resonant frequency for a density of 42.6 nodes per wavelength (when N=5), which shows better consistency than the previous FLAME. Further, the new method converges more quickly than the FEM with linear elements, as the node density is increased, though it is less accurate than the FEM with quadratic elements.</description><creator>Gu, Huanhuan, 1983-</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Photonic crystals.</subject><title>Photonic crystal cavity analysis using a simplified flexible local approximation method with an anisotropic perfectly matched layer boundary condition</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Huanhuan Gu, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vd66w007j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nk322d48d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:np193944t</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:03:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The past half-decade has seen progress in methodology and reusable components available to designers of music authoring tools. This thesis examines currently prevalent architectures for music making software and applies currently available technical means to update design methodology and architectural patterns for the next-generation of tools. It aims to map the various categories of advances and the manner in which they relate to each other, to the problem of building these tools. The focus is on conceptualization. The thesis aims to understand, from historical perspectives, as well as from perspectives provided by other domains, the fundamental problems encountered in the process of designing authoring tools. Issues examined include building rich visual and interactive interfaces for authoring, the use of multiple notations and formalisms to describe multiple aspects of musical structure, end-user extensibility and end-user script ability. The results of design experiments implementing core ideas are documented, and the manner in which the ideas from these prototypes may be applied to the construction of real-world tools is discussed. As far as possible, the thesis investigates existing tools, frameworks, design ideas, and architectural possibilities that scale. In conclusion, the manner in which the investigation relates to the future of authoring tools, and to problems faced by contemporary artists and tool-makers is discussed.</description><creator>Raghu, Vamshi.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Composition (Music) -- Computer programs.</subject><subject>Computer composition.</subject><title>On the design of extensible music authoring tools</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Vamshi Raghu, 2007</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8623hz03h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/np193944t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Schulich School of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pr76f3709</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:03:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis uses the film philosophy of Gilles Deleuze in Cinema 1: The Movement-Image (1983, trans. 1986) and Cinema 2: The Time-Image (1985, trans. 1989) as a methodology for examining the subject of film in Thomas Pynchon's novel Gravity's Rainbow (1973). The first half of the thesis provides a review of the literature on the subject of film in Gravity's Rainbow, as well as a review of current scholarship on Deleuze's Cinema books, before providing a close reading of both Cinema books that summarizes and explicates the elaborate taxonomy of cinematic signs and images developed by Deleuze. The second half of the thesis uses Deleuze's cinematic taxonomy to analyze examples of time-images and movement-images in Gravity's Rainbow. The thesis concludes by connecting the work of Pynchon's novel to the work of Deleuze's study in a discussion of how film participates in the emergence of a new concept of history during the postwar period.</description><creator>Pokotylo, Heather.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Motion pictures in literature.</subject><subject>Pynchon, Thomas.

On the one hand, their access to public services and resources was importantly constrained, submerging many into increasingly pauperized conditions. On the other hand, new distinctions were created within these nationally defined groups as a result of discursive and residential strategies deployed by many of these immigrants.</description><creator>Recalde, Aranzazu.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Immigrants -- Argentina -- La Plata -- Legal status, laws, etc.</subject><subject>Argentina -- Emigration and immigration.</subject><title>Immigration, nationalism and transnationalism in Argentina : the impact of criminalizing discourses and practices on the Peruvian, Bolivian and Paraguayan immigrants in La Plata City</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Aranzazu Recalde, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pc289j271.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mp48sd06m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anthropology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n870zr05p</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:03:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis offers a critical study of Gabrielle Roy's presence in Jacques Poulin's works.

What factors positively influence the decision-making process in the case of a policy harmonization between two countries? By studying both countries' institutional differences and governmental and non-governmental actors' preferences in the energy sector, this research analyzes the bilateral cooperation between Canada and the United States regarding the creation of the Electric Reliability Organization. Although domestic institutional constraints are important to consider, I argue that both physical and economic market integration and the use of a non-governmental organization by central governments have facilitated the success of the cooperation process. Those factors have favored the convergence of decisional actors' preferences and the inclusion of the majority of actors from all sectors of the industry into the process. The analysis uses a sequential model implying the division decision-making process over foreign policy into specific stages to show the importance of domestic variables. Key words: Governmental cooperation, bilateral relations, actors' preferences, institution, energy sector, electricity, transmission network, reliability standards, market integration, restructured electricity market.</description><creator>Lemieux, Christine.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Electric power distribution -- United States.</subject><subject>United States -- Foreign relations -- Canada.</subject><subject>Canada -- Foreign relations -- United States.</subject><subject>Electric power distribution -- Canada.</subject><title>La coopération politique bilatérale entre le Canada et les États-Unis dans le secteur énergétique : l'harmonisation des normes de fiabilité reliées au transport de l'électricité</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Christine Lemieux, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1v53jx23b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5t34sj89c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:37720d045</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:03:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This master's thesis in literary creation is composed of two parts. The first one, a literary critic approaches the confrontation between memory and oblivion, in the novelistic work One hundred years of solitude from Colombian Gabriel Garcia Marquez through various themes. Primarily, we explain how this duality is seen through hereditary memories, loneliness, activity and inertia. In the next chapters, we show how this duality is also connected with death, collective and individual memories which contributes to make history and identity, with transformation of the past by careful scrutiny of the writing and sleep themes, and finally, to the memory awakened by associations coming from a sensual perception of the past, along with the significance given to objects and through the omnipresence of repetition.

Given the volume of capital they mobilize, hedge funds are capable of precipitating 'herding'---the underlying dynamic behind the transmission of financial distress and the precursor to systemic crises. Greater regulatory oversight of hedge-fund activities could reduce these excesses without necessarily impinging on the self-correcting mechanism of the free market. Presently, there is no regime or monetary authority in place that would compel states to undertake efforts to enhance existing regulatory structures so as to mitigate the exigency of systemic risk. That coordination has not been achieved exposes both the obstacles facing monetary cooperation for establishing a more robust international financial order and the limitations of liberal theories of international cooperation. It also makes evident the importance of hegemonic participation in the construction of economic regimes in an era of accelerating financial globalization.</description><creator>Kosobucki, Edwin A.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Hedge funds.</subject><subject>Financial services industry.</subject><title>Hedging risk : hedge funds and the politics of financial regulatory harmonization</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Edwin A.

The global pop-culture idiom born of the Jamaican socio-religious movement of rastafari allows these young Accrans to articulate self-concepts vis-a-vis very current trends in local and foreign youth cultures (such as hiphop), with reference to an ostensibly ageless collective identity. Questions of authenticity are made complex by the movement's weighty historical and political roots, its nuanced symbolic bonds with "local African culture", and the semiotic plasticity of its identifying practices. Ethnographic portions of this thesis are based on three months of fieldwork in Accra, during the summer of 2004. Key theoretical points are gleaned from a critical examination of early British Cultural Studies and its theoretical progeny, including the body of recent work tentatively dubbed "post-subcultural studies".</description><creator>Kerfoot, Janice.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Rastafari movement -- Ghana -- Accra.</subject><subject>Popular music -- Ghana -- Accra.</subject><title>Babylon boys don't dance : music, meaning, and young men in Accra</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Janice Kerfoot, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r207tp58j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p2676v87g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anthropology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hx11xf51f</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:03:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Niyaz Fateḥpuri (1884-1966 A.D./1302-1384 A.H.) was an accomplished literary critic, poet and religious scholar. He published a very successful magazine Nigar, primarily a literary journal, which soon became a platform for debating many of the most controversial religious, ideological, political and sociological issues of the time. It began publication in 1922 and continues to this day. This thesis, the first detailed study in English, aims to put forward and analyze Fateḥpuri's religious and social views in the context of the socio-political situation of the time. Through Nigar, Fateḥpuri campaigned against the traditionalists, who he felt were responsible for the lack of both worldly and spiritual progress of Muslims because they fostered an unquestioning attitude on religious matters. He discussed many religious concepts, for instance, revelation, free will and predestination, the hereafter, as well as the purpose of Islamic practices like prayer, fasting and charity. He believed that the basic purpose of religion was to teach akhlaq (ethical spirit) to people. Akhlaq, for him, meant doing good deeds for their own sake (as an individual's natural duty) and for the love of God. He offered what he believed to be the "rational" meaning of religion; his interpretation of religion was completely shorn of anything super-natural, and consisted of only those beliefs and actions which he thought were logical. However, he defended the traditional role of women in society, which he saw as managing the household effectively. He considered this rational, since nature had made men and women different to enable them to perform different roles in society. Women, however, were equal to men, since their role in society was as important as that of men.</description><creator>Shahin, Juhi.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Niyāz Fatḥpūrī, 1884-1966.</subject><subject>Ulama.</subject><title>Niyāz Fateḥpurī and the 'Ulamā' : criticism and debates (1922-1966)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Juhi Shahin, 2007</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5m60qs18v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hx11xf51f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Islamic Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h702q658j</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:03:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>With English becoming a world language, an increasing number of non-native-English-speaking (NNES) students are pursuing studies in English-medium universities. Of these NNES students, Chinese students constitute a large proportion. Most of these Chinese students are NNES and need English language support to help them meet academic demands in English-speaking settings. However, there are a very limited number of studies conducted on linguistic needs and deficiencies among Chinese students at English-speaking universities in Canada. The main objective of this thesis is to discover Chinese students' perceptions of academic English listening competence and to investigate their academic listening needs for academic success at Canadian universities. This small-scale study at two Canadian universities, conducted through a questionnaire survey and follow-up interviews, fills a gap in the limited number of studies concerning Chinese students' language-development needs at Canadian universities. Findings of this study support the following points. Firstly, Chinese students think that having sufficient English academic listening competence is crucial and necessary for academic success in academic English settings. Secondly, Chinese students still have difficulties in various academic listening skills, and factors that affect students' listening comprehension are both linguistically and socio-culturally related to the new settings. Thirdly, Chinese students still need target-language linguistic support even though they are admitted into English-medium universities. Finally, apart from academic listening competence, Chinese students report deficiencies in academic writing, reading and speaking as well. In addition, this study also suggests that Chinese students may lack good strategies for enhancing their English-language proficiency.</description><creator>Shen, Ying, 1974-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>English language -- Study and teaching -- Chinese speakers.</subject><subject>Listening.</subject><title>A study of Chinese students' academic listening needs for academic success in Canadian universities /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Ying Shen, 2007</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qf85nb51z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h702q658j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Second Language Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xs55mc33n</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:04:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The distinction between emotions expressed by and evoked by music is often blurred by the use of methodologies that are difficult to compare, preventing progress towards a unifying theory of emotion and music. In this thesis, a methodology for experimentation that clarifies how research in these areas can be conducted clearly and independently is proposed. The study of evoked emotions is emphasized, and two novel controllers are developed to examine methods of recording emotional response continuously. These controllers, along with a number of the proposed methodological changes, are tested against an established controller in an experiment designed to record emotional changes to participant-selected musical pieces. The results support predictions regarding the effects that the experimental setting can have on the emotional responses of the participant. Usability ratings of one of the new controllers were found to be slightly higher than those of the established controller, while providing an interface that is less emotionally distracting for the participant. It also provides the ability to record instances of physiological reactions evoked in the participant.</description><creator>Shortway, Nicholas.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Music, Influence of.</subject><subject>Music -- Psychological aspects.</subject><title>&amp;quot;This one goes to eleven--&amp;quot; : a methodological study of the recording and evaluation of emotional response to music</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Nicholas Shortway, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2r36tx76s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xs55mc33n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Schulich School of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:j098zb349</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:04:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis examines the interrelation between ritual (seva), aesthetic experience, and philosophy in the Puṣṭimarga Vaiṣṇava bhakti tradition of Vallabha (ca.1479-1531). In Vallabha's Suddhadvaita ("pure non-dual") philosophy, Kṛṣṇa is described as the embodiment of bliss or ananda. At the moment of creation, Kṛṣṇa manifests the world and individual souls (jivas) out of himself, but conceals the ananda within the jivas, and subjects them to his power of ignorance (avidya). Thus, jivas are in the search for restoring their ananda, which can only occur as a result of being in Kṛṣṇa's presence. I argue that it is by performing ritual that Puṣṭimarga devotees experience Kṛṣṇa's eternal lila ("play" or "sport"), transcend their states of avidya, and permanently restore their ananda. In Puṣṭimarga, emotion (bhava) is both the path to experiencing Kṛṣṇa and the goal of this path in and of itself. Puṣṭimarga theologians validate the salvific role of emotion by invoking Sanskrit aesthetic theory.
