The present experiments tested whether phosphorylation of VAChT by activation of PKC via phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) could affect the uptake and subsequent K+-evoked release of [3H]acetylcholine from rat hippocampal slices. No change in release was found. PMA also had no effect on the decreased release of [3H]acetylcholine caused by vesamicol, a noncompetitive inhibitor of acetylcholine uptake into synaptic vesicles. In addition, immunoprecipitation of VAChT and probing of western blots with an antiphosphoserine antibody showed no phosphorylation of the transporter. These results suggest that the phorbol ester mediated activation of PKC does not cause the phosphorylation of VAChT under the conditions used in this study.</description><creator>Ryan, Patricia, 1970-</creator><contributor>Collier, Brian (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Phorbol ester effects on the release of acetylcholine from rat hippocampal slices</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p5547t58p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z029p687z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mc87ps702</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:17:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Chromosome 11p15.5 harbors a gene or genes involved in Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) and that confer(s) susceptibility to Wilms' tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, and hepatoblastoma. PowerBLAST of P1 artificial chromosome clones from this region identified two novel transcripts with open reading frames encoding putative proteins of 253 and 424 amino acids. The larger of the transcripts was shown by Northern blot to be predominantly expressed in the fetal and adult liver and kidney. This transcript shares homology with integral membrane organic cation transporters, such as the tetracycline resistance proteins and bacterial multidrug resistance proteins; and was therefore designated ORCTL2 (organic cation transporter-like 2). An expressed sequence polymorphism provided evidence that the ORCTL2 gene exhibits "leaky" imprinting in both human fetal kidney and human fetal liver. Given the expression pattern of ORCTL2, it is possible that this gene may have a role in the development of phenotypes associated with BWS, including Wilms' tumor (WT). SSCP analysis on 51 sporatic WT samples did not identify any mutations in ORCTL2 which would implicate it in disease. Investigation of the transport properties of ORCTL2 show that this protein can confer resistance to chloroquine and quinidine when overexpressed in bacteria. Immunohistochemistry performed with anti-ORCTL2 polyclonal antibodies on human renal sections indicate that ORCTL2 is localized on the apical membrane surface of the proximal tubules. These results suggest that ORCTL2 may play a role in the transport of chloroquine and quinidine related compounds within the kidney.</description><creator>Reece, Mark T.</creator><contributor>Pelletier, Jerry (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Biology, Genetics.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Functional characterization of OCTRL2 : an organic cation transporter expressed in the renal proximal tubules</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m326m402b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mc87ps702</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1n79h661v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:17:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>With increasing interest in the transmission of audio-visual applications (e.g. MPEG-2) over ATM best effort services, such as Available Bit-Rate (ABR) and Unspecific Bit-Rate (UBR), efficient video-oriented control mechanisms for improving the video quality in the presence of loss have to be designed. In this thesis, we proposed and evaluated a new quality of service control framework for use with modified Unspecific Bit Rate service. We surveyed a number of issues related to the coding and control of MPEG-2 video data streams transmitted over ATM networks, analyzed the network factors affecting the quality of service of real-time video applications and showed how this proposed video-oriented QoS control framework improve the performance for such services. The presented framework relies on four components: a dynamic frame-level priority data partition mechanism based on MPEG-2 data structure and feedback from the network; an enhanced ATM Adaptation Layer type 5 (AAL-5) associated with a new slice-based MPEG-2 encapsulation strategy; a forward error correction (FEC) mechanism, which is implemented at the AAL-5 service specific convergence sublayer to provide the error detection and recovery capability, and a video-oriented cell discarding scheme, which adaptively and selectively adjusts discard level according to switch buffer occupancy, video cell payload types and FEC drop tolerance. This best-effort video delivery framework is evaluated using simulation and real MPEG-2 video data. The overall objective of this proposed framework is twofold. First, ensuring a graceful picture quality degradation by minimizing cell loss probability for critical video data while guaranteeing a bounded cell transfer delay. Second, optimizing the network effective throughput by reducing the transmission of non useful data. In comparison to previous approaches, the performance evaluation has shown a significant reduction of the bad throughput and minimization of losses of Intra- and Predictive-coded frames at the video slice layer.</description><creator>Pu, Song, 1968-</creator><contributor>Guemhioui, Karim El (advisor)</contributor><contributor>Friedman, Nathan (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>MPEG-2 transport over ATM networks with best effort service</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cn69m620c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1n79h661v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gq67jt37w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:17:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Breast and ovarian cancers are among the most common tumours affecting Canadian women. A proportion of these tumours was thought to be due to family history and the breast cancer susceptibility gene and are more likely to occur before the age of 50. It is hypothesized that women who have both primary tumours of the breast and ovary are more likely to have a mutation in this gene. The main objective of this study is to examine the role of family history in those women with breast cancer that subsequently develop ovarian cancer. The role of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the treatment of breast cancer, as a risk factor for future development of ovarian cancer, was also assessed. This was a case-control study.

These practices can each affect weed communities, crop weed interactions and crop yields. Little is known about their combined effects on weed populations and weed community dynamics in common cropping systems. The main objective of this project was to determine the effects of crop rotation, weed control, tillage and nutrient source and their interactions on weed communities and weed emergence. The field experiment was conducted on a Sainte-Rosalie clay and a Duravin loam in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec, Canada, in 1996 and 1997. Mechanical control was not as effective as chemical control in controlling weed populations. Weed density increased after the second pass of the rotary hoe in soybean. Cultivation in corn triggered flushes of weed emergence, but corn yield was not affected by the increase in weed density. Chisel plow tillage reduced the efficacy of mechanical weed control in both crops. Reduced soybean yields were partly attributed to the large quantities of corn residues under chisel plow tillage. Nutrient source had no effect on weed densities. However, environmental stress conditions experienced in spring 1997 resulted in reduced crop growth and increased weed biomass under organic fertilization. Seed production of dominant residual weed species was greater under mechanical compared with chemical weed control, but was unaffected by tillage and nutrient source. Particular attention to weed management will be required when including both chisel plow tillage and organic nutrient source in a corn-soybean rotation, especially when resorting to mechanical weed control only.</description><creator>Perron, France.</creator><contributor>Legere, Anne (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Corn -- Weed control -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Crop rotation -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Soybean -- Weed control -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Tillage -- Québec (Province).</subject><title>Weed response to weed control, tillage and nutrient source in a corn-soybean rotation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bk128d118.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x633f346j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Plant Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9z9032046</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:17:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The function of the normal cellular human prion protein (PrPC), a highly expressed protein of the brain, is presently unclear. Based on the amino acid sequence homology between PrPC, Bcl-2, and Bax proteins, we propose that PrPC may be implicated in modulating neuronal survival and death as a member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. The present study investigates interactions between human PrPC, Bcl-2, and Bax in human primary foetal neurons as well as in, human foetal and adult brains by crosslinking and co-immunoprecipitation. The PrPC-Bcl-2 interaction was also tested by the yeast-two-hybrid system. Results indicate an interaction between PrPC and Bcl-2 as well as PrPC and Bax in vivo and in vitro. In addition, the expression levels of PrPC, Bcl-2, and Bax were studied in the cerebellum of human foetal and adult brain. Results show that the levels of Bcl-2 and Bax decrease with age whereas the levels of PrPC increase. In the aging central nervous system, PrPC may functionally replace Bcl-2 or Bax. Overexpression or different modifications of PrPC such as conformational change and mutations may disrupt the protein-protein interactions between PrPC, Bcl-2, and Bax. If PrPC-Bcl-2/Bax interactions function in neuronal survival, disruption of these interactions could explain the underlying molecular mechanism of neuronal death in prion diseases.

Activation of the presynaptic GABAB receptors decrease or block inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitter release and activation of postsynaptic receptors produces a slow hyperpolarization of the neuron. Previous electrophysiological reports in the literature have demonstrated that activation of GABAB receptors, with the agonist baclofen, can have a proconvulsant effect in some models of epilepsy recorded in the adult brain. The purpose of this study was to examine how baclofen influenced 4-aminopyridine (4AP)-induced epileptiform activity in the juvenile rat hippocampus. Our results show that baclofen application to 4AP-treated slices obtained from juvenile rats, reduces excitatory and inhibitory transmitter release. This action eventually abolishes the asynchronous action-potential dependent EPSPs and IPSPs, as well as the synchronous brief interictal discharges. Baclofen, however, does not abolish the synchronous depolarizing GABA-mediated potentials or ictal discharges, which reflect intense action potential firing invading presynaptic terminals. The results obtained in this study indicate that GABAB receptor activation does have a proconvulsant effect in the 4AP model of epilepsy. We suggest that activity-dependent changes in excitability and disinhibition are responsible for this proconvulsant activity.</description><creator>Motalli, Rita Nadia.</creator><contributor>Avoli, Massimo (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>GABAB receptors and epileptiform activity in the juvenile rat hippocampus</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vm40xt92v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/76537322f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:v692t844b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:17:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>According to the classic neuron doctrine, action potentials (APs) are generated at the axon hillock and then travel orthodromically to the axon terminals. However, APs can also be generated from sites remote from the axon hillock, that is, at ectopic sites located in axons or dendrites. Ectopic action potentials (EAPs) generated at axon terminals have been shown to travel antidromically to the soma where they can lower the excitability threshold for somatic AP generation. EAP's are thought to be important in synaptic plasticity and in neuronal network synchronization, both in physiological as well as pathological conditions. In this study, we investigated EAP generation in CA3 neurons of rat brain slices perfused with 4-aminopyridine (4AP, 50muM) using intracellular recordings as well as various phamacological agents. We found that EAPs were: (i) generated at or near the terminal region of the Schaffer collaterals in CA I, (ii) dependent upon activation of voltage-dependent Na+ channels, and (iii) GABAA receptor-dependent.</description><creator>Méthot, Mario.</creator><contributor>Avoli, Massimo (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>GABA-dependent generation of ectopic action potentials in the rat hippocampus in vitro</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/df65v986c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v692t844b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h415pc66d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:17:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Recently, an important role has been attributed to endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor and a mitogenic factor. The prostate and the vascular endothelium, including that of the penis, are known to produce ET-1. Furthermore, it has been shown that there are two receptor subtypes in the penis, ETa and ETb. Radiation treatment is known to cause an increase in ET-1 and may be a fundamental cause of radiation-associated impotence (RAI). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of ET-1 in RAI. In the first part of our study, rats were divided into groups according to a different radiation dose. A ET-1 time course in tissue and serum was established. Markedly higher ET-1 levels were found in a high radiation dose compared with a lower dose and in the control group. In the second part of the study, rats underwent evaluation of erectile function after radiation therapy. Subsequently, rats were given an antagonist of ETa (BQ-123) to assess whether the erectile response could be potentiated. Our results show that the use of this specific antagonist results in an improved erectile activity in a rat animal model.

The present study provides evidence that age-related oligospermia may be caused by the altered ability of testicular germ cells to undergo the first mitosis and meiosis. This is due to decreased DNA replication and/or repair in response to DNA damage. Young and aging rats were exposed to either saline or an alkylating agent, cyclophosphamide. The ability of the male germ cells to replicate and/or repair their DNA was estimated by examining expression of PCNA (an essential component of DNA replication and repair machinery) and incorporation of BrdU (analog of thymidine). PCNA expression correlated with that of BrdU incorporation. The ability of germ cells to replicate and/or repair their DNA was affected by both the aging process and cyclophosphamide exposure in a stage-specific manner. At mitosis 1, expression of PCNA and BrdU incorporation decreased with both age and drug exposure. Mitosis 2 was not affected by either age or cyclophosphamide. Meiosis was affected only by the aging process. These differential effects are due, probably, to the different types of DNA damage caused by aging and drug exposure: age produces a long term chronic damage while cyclophosphamide exposure produces an acute short term damage. The results of this study suggest that different mechanisms may be involved in mediating cell cycle arrest and DNA repair at different stages of spermatogenesis.</description><creator>Liachenko, Anna.</creator><contributor>Robaire, Bernard (advisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</subject><title>Changes in the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and bromodeoxyuredine (BrdU) incorporation in the testes of rats with age and after acute exposure to cyclophosphamide</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rx913r97v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j67316154</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xd07gv82s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:17:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Bulimia Nervosa (BN) is believed to have a multidimensional causality including developmental factors and neurobiological vulnerabilities. This study examined diverse clinical features (e.g., binge and vomit frequency, eating attitudes, impulsivity, dissociative symptoms, and affective instability) and two putative causal agents (e.g., childhood sexual/physical abuse and serotonin abnormalities) in bulimics with and without a comorbid Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Twenty-seven BN sufferers and 25 normal-eater controls underwent a multidimensional assessment of eating symptoms, psychiatric symptoms, personality disturbances, experiences of childhood abuse and serotonin (5-HT) dysfunction. The latter was measured using paroxetine binding in blood platelets. In contrast to control subjects, borderline and nonborderline bulimics both displayed comparable abnormalities on paroxetine binding Bmax measure and eating symptomatology, whereas the borderline bulimics alone displayed particular elevations on measures of childhood trauma, impulsivity, dissociation, and to some extent affective instability.

The cap structure (m7GpppN, where N is any nucleotide) is extremely important for the processing and translation of mRNA. A modified form of this cap is also present in some snRNAs. Several cap-recognizing proteins that mediate these processes have been characterized. This thesis describes a novel human cytoplasmic protein that is 30% identical and 60% similar in sequence to the human translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). This protein, named 4E-Homologous Protein (4EHP), binds specifically to the cap structure. Sequence alignment and site-directed mutagenesis analysis of 4EHP strongly suggest that it shares with eIF4E a common mechanism for cap binding. Some of its characteristics include: (1) it has two alternative N-termini, (2) it is a phosphoprotein, (3) it interacts with higher-molecular-weight proteins, and (4) it is low in cellular amount. Putative functions for 4EHP are discussed.</description><creator>Kim, Hyung Chan, 1972-</creator><contributor>Sonenberg, Nahum (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><title>Characterization of a novel mammalian cap-binding protein</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0g354h47n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8910jw756</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bg257h07f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:17:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The two-dimensional solidification of a dilute binary melt in the small Peclet number with small surface tension is considered.

The quality of the product is the single most important reason that determines its acceptance and success. The basic project management problem is "delivery of a product with targeted quality, within the budget, and on schedule". We propose a state-of-the-art approach that gets closer to the solution by improving the software development process used. An important objective in all software development is to ensure that the delivered product is as fault-free as possible. We proposed three hypotheses that relate the OO design properties---inheritance, cohesion, and coupling---and the fault-proneness as software's quality indicator. We built classification models that predict which components are likely to be faulty, based on an appropriate suite of OO design measures. The models represent empirical evidence that the aforementioned relationships exist. We used the C4.5 machine learning algorithm as a predictive modeling technique, because it is robust, reliable, and allows intelligible interpretation of the results. We defined three new measures that quantify the specific contribution of each of the metrics selected by the model(s), and also provide a deeper insight into the design structure of the product. We evaluated the quality of the predictive models using an objective set of standards. The models built have high quality.</description><creator>Ikonomovski, Stefan V.</creator><contributor>Ratzer, Gerald (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Artificial Intelligence.</subject><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Detection of faulty components in object-oriented systems using design metrics and a machine learning algorithm</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9g54xk731.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bv73c2774</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mk61rk24f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:17:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Drosophila groucho gene has been implicated in the specification of a number of different cell lineages and is believed to be a component of the Notch signal transduction pathway. Mammalian homologues of Groucho, the TLE proteins, have similarly been implicated in cellular commitment events in higher organisms. As little is known about the molecular mechanisms of the TLEs, I chose to study these proteins utilizing a number of cellular, molecular and biochemical approaches. These investigations have shown that primary cultures of both undifferentiated and differentiated neural cells express TLE proteins. Furthermore, upon neural determination of pluripotential P19 embryonic carcinoma cells, a number of transient changes occur in the expression profile and phosphorylation state of the TLE proteins. Phosphorylated TLE1 proteins with an apparent molecular mass of roughly 118 kDa are induced as a function of differentiation and exhibit a higher affinity for the nuclear compartment than do their lower molecular mass cousins (90--93 kDa). These results implicate phosphorylation in the activity of TLE1 proteins and suggest that phosphorylated forms of higher molecular masses are involved in nuclear functions. Finally, these studies suggest that different TLE proteins respond in variable ways to the neural commitment of P19 cells, suggesting that individual members of this protein family may have non-redundant functions.</description><creator>Husain, Junaid.</creator><contributor>Stifani, Stefano (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Analysis of TLE expression and phosphorylation during mammalian neurogenesis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20sv948.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mk61rk24f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8623j109r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:17:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Despite its importance in activities of daily living, little research has been done on the recovery of upper extremity (UE) function in acute stroke. The objectives of this prospective study were to quantify the recovery of UE function during the first five weeks post-stroke; to compare the recovery of UE function with the recovery of lower extremity (LE) function; and to identify predictors of recovery of UE function. Fifty-five first-time stroke patients were evaluated using measures of UE and LE function at the first and fifth week post-stroke. Standardized response means were used to compare the recovery of UE and LE. Multiple linear regression was used to identify predictors of UE function. There was no evidence that the recovery of the UE was different from that of the LE. Measures of UE function at the first week post-stroke were the most important predictors of UE function one month post-stroke.</description><creator>Higgins, Johanne.</creator><contributor>Mayo, N.

This thesis reports an attempt to express rat COII from a nuclear transgene. Using PCR strategies, the mitochondrial matrix targeting sequence from rat ornithine carbamyltransferase, was attached to a version of the rat COII gene which had been recoded into the universal genetic code. The transgene was cloned into the pLXSN retroviral vector and GP+E-86 ecotropic packaging cells were transfected with the construct. Infectious retrovirus particles were collected and used to infect C2C12 mouse myoblast and NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cell lines. Expression of mRNA from the transgene was assessed in both cell lines using an RT-PCR strategy. For each cell type, protein expression from the transgene was assessed in the two clones showing the highest levels of mRNA expression. COII protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis using peptide-specific polyclonal antibodies directed to the C-terminus of rat COII. The transgene was expressed in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system in which transcription and translation are coupled. In vitro translation products were immunoprecipitated using the COII peptide-specific antibodies.

In early experiments tritiated thymidine was used to label the satellite cells prior to injection into the injured myocardium. Tritiated thymidine however was not seen in the retrieved heart specimens. This gave rise to the criticism that there was no definitive proof that cardiac tissue fibres originating in the injured myocardium were a result of the satellite cell implantation. It was felt that tritiated thymidine was an inadequate label possibly due to a dilutional effect. It was also thought that the cryo-injury was too severe to allow for a sufficient micro environment for cell growth. The purpose of the present study was to develop an appropriate labelling technique that would confirm without doubt that the satellite cells injected indeed led to myocardial regeneration.

The major aim of this study was to determine whether human airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells may be a source of eotaxin in asthma. The evidence presented in this thesis shows constitutive eotaxin gene expression in ASM in vitro that is markedly increased following stimulation with the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1beta. Release of eotaxin was confirmed in ASM culture supernatants which contained significant chemoattractant activity for eosinophils that was partly inhibited with antibodies directed against eotaxin or RANTES, and maximally inhibited by a combined blockade of both chemokines. Strong signals for eotaxin immunoreactivity were also observed in vivo in smooth muscle in asthmatic airways. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that ASM may contribute to airway inflammation in asthma through the production and release of eotaxin.</description><creator>Ghaffar, Omar.</creator><contributor>Hamid, Qutayba (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</subject><title>Constitutive and cytokine-stimulated expression of eotaxin by human airway smooth muscle cells</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rf55z9910.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9c67wp91q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pathology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cv43p036r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:17:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Prosaposin is a glycoprotein that exists in two forms: a 65-kDa isoform which is found in lysosomes and a 70-kDa form which is secreted to the extracellular space. In the lysosome, prosaposin is proteolytically cleaved into four polypeptides named saposin A, B, C and D. Each of these subunits mediates the breakdown of glycosphingolipids in conjunction with specific hydrolases present in the lysosome. The absence of either a saposin or the specific hydrolase is the cause of a number of lysosomal storage diseases, such as a variant form of Gaucher's disease and metachromatic leukodystrophy. Although the 65-kDa isomer is found in lysosomes, the precise site of entry of this protein along these acidic compartments is not known. Therefore, the first objective of this study was to find out whether prosaposin enters into the lysosome, endosome, or both. The second objective of this study was to determine whether lysosomotropic agents, such as ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) and leupeptin, affect the concentration of prosaposin in the endosomal/lysosomal pathway.

We apply program slicing, introduced by Weiser, to extract reusable functions for later study. Program Slicing is a method of finding all statements that might directly or indirectly affect that values of variables. It is implemented by analyzing the program's data flow and control flow. We extend the definition of program slice to an encapsulated slicing algorithm, since we intend to present a new approach on decomposing a routine into a set of routines and get an executable sequence of those subroutines to obtain the same effects as the original routine. Here, the routine could be function, procedure, or method, etc. The approach is related to assign programs and subroutines as object methods exploiting object-oriented design metrics in another part of the study. Our study is to propose a functional reusable slicing algorithm. The goal for our whole project is using some specific techniques to extract the reusable components from the existing procedure code based on certain applications as well as preserving the functions of target code.</description><creator>Fu, Jian, 1974-</creator><contributor>Lounis, Hakim (advisor)</contributor><contributor>Ratzer, Gerald (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>A new approach on slicing techniques for program reuse /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2z10ws49s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6108vd668</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4j03d2179</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:17:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Daily 1200 UTC sea-level pressure, 850-hPa height and temperature, and 500-hPa height fields are used in a compositing analysis to document the synoptic evolution of wintertime precipitation events over Montreal. Since there has been a bias in past studies towards analyzing extreme events, four precipitation intensity categories are defined. A summary of the findings are as follows: (i) Heavier precipitation events are associated with a ridge-trough couplet as opposed to a trough for lighter events. The magnitude of the downstream ridge is influenced by the strength of warm advection at the 850-hPa level. (ii) Differences in the intensity of precipitation can be related to preferred climatological storm tracks and possible moisture inflow from the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Great Lakes.

The courseware can be installed under 32bit versions of Windows' operating systems. CD-ROM's were used as the courseware distribution media. A LAN version, which uses NetBEUI protocol to access Windows' workgroups, has also been activated. Course material was first digitized and then placed in a Windows' Graphic User Interface (GUI) using Microsoft Visual Basic versions 4--5. Multimedia files, including images, sound, and movies were then added to enhance visualization. Students can navigate through the courseware in a non-linear fashion akin to multimedia hyperlink technology. The courseware contains all of the conventional course material in text format with multimedia additions so that students can follow class material on computers. Simulation and prediction tools were also added in order to aid students in problem visualization and solving. The course instructor can update material by uploading material through an ActiveX web site. The courseware is then automatically updated when an active TCP/IP connection is detected on the client side using a similar ActiveX control. Program performance is optimized through the use of a high-speed CD-ROM drive and at least 32 megabytes of RAM. The network version performs substantially slower than its CD-ROM equivalent since a Network bandwidth bottleneck occurs.</description><creator>Delombaerde, Fred.</creator><contributor>Madramootoo, Chandra (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Hydrology -- Study and teaching (Higher).</subject><subject>Computer-assisted instruction.</subject><subject>Hydrology -- Interactive multimedia.</subject><title>Development of multimedia courseware technology for use in hydrology and water management instruction</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4j03d218k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/db78tf207</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:v405sc444</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:18:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is an ubiquitous pathogen which can cause severe opportunistic infection in immune compromised or suppressed patients. Current vaccine strategies use recombinant glycoprotein gB subunits; however, little is known about the immunogenicity of this glycoprotein and the possible induction of autoimmunity. Using established ELISA assays and immunoblotting, anti-viral and autoantibody responses were detected following intraperitoneal injection of a recombinant Adenovirus-gB construct. The immune response to gB was studied in MRL/mpj (H-2k), BALB/c (H-2d), C3H (H-2 k) and BALB.k (H-2k) mice. A significant IgG anti-viral response was induced in all four strains. IgG autoantibodies, including Rheumatoid Factor (RF), anti-DNA, and anti-U1 70K were also induced. Antibodies to U1 70K are typical of patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD). The most significant antibody responses were to gB and to U1 70K, with higher levels detected in the autoimmune prone mice. Since multiple genetic factors influence the immune response, immunization of this construct in genetically predisposed individuals could trigger the onset of an autoimmune disease state such as SLE.</description><creator>Curtis, Heather.</creator><contributor>Newkirk, M.

We have previously shown in our laboratory that several seIective sigma 1 ligands potentiate the neuronal response to NMDA in the dorsal hippocampus of rat. The non selective beta/sigma2 ligand, DTG, also potentiates the neuronal response. However, when it is administered at doses between 3 and 40 mug/kg, the increase of NMDA-induced activation turns in to an epileptoid activity. Data presented in this thesis suggest that similarly to sigma 1 ligands, selective sigma2 ligands such as Lu 28-179, Lu 29-252 and BD 1008 dose-dependently potentiate the NMDA response. Interestingly, the effects of these drugs are not reversed by the non selective sigma 1/sigma2 antagonist haloperidol, by the neurosteroid progesterone nor by the selective a sigma1 antagonist NE-100. The sigma 2 ligand CB-64D also potentiates, dose-dependently, the NMDA response, its effect, however is reversed by haloperidol and by the neurosteroid progesterone. All sigma2 ligands failed to generate any epileptoid activity on their own but, with the subsequent administration of a sigma1 agonist (JO-1784), an epileptoid activity was induced. This epileptoid activity was not observed following the subsequent administration of the sigma 1 agonist (+)-pentazocine. The sigma receptor is believed to be a non opioid receptor insensitive to naloxone. However, recently, a protein has been identified that resembles the sigma opioid receptor originally proposed by Martin and colleagues in 1976. Therefore to answer this discrepancy, we verified the spectrum of sigma ligands for which the potentiation of the NMDA response is mediated by the naloxone-sensitive sigma receptor. The potentiation of the NMDA response induced by (+)-pentazocine, but not JO-1784, BD-737 and L, 687-384, was suppressed by naloxone. The data presented in this thesis suggest that: (1) similarly to sigma1 ligands, sigma2 agonists potentiate the NMDA response; (2) the coactivation of one type of sigma1 and sigma2 receptors appears to be necessary to induce epileptoid activity; (3) haloperidol may not act as a sigma2 antagonist; (4) and (+)-pent azocine might act on two types of sigma1 receptor: one which is haloperidol sensitive and an other, which is naloxone sensitive but different than the opiate receptors.</description><creator>Couture, Sophie.</creator><contributor>Debonnel, Guy (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</subject><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Electrophysiological studies in rat dorsal hippocampus : modulation of the neuronal response to N-methyl-D-aspartate by selective sigma1 and sigma2 ligands</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bn9998753.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j96023097</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):2175</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
