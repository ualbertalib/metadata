Concurrent Engineering (CE), a new methodology and a systematic approach to the integrated design of products and related processes including manufacture and support is ideal, for this environment. Organizations implement CE to achieve specific goals. This thesis focuses on the goals of time, cost and quality for implementing CE. The existence of specific models or methods of implementation of CE for specific goals has been investigated and metrics for specific models classified. Case studies of organizations implementing CE are outlined and differences in implementations pointed out. Organizations focusing on time put. more emphasis on stages/activities between detailed specification and detailed design stages in a CE NPD process. Organizations focusing on quality and cost put more emphasis on the stages/activities between preliminary design and volume production. Metrics for CE processes targeting specific goals have also been classified. However, it has been found that metrics are not restricted to specific goals.</description><creator>Balakrishnan, AnandKumar.</creator><contributor>Thomson, Vince (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Concurrent engineering : models and metrics</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v405sc52t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9s161835r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z029p6887</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:21:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Photovoltaic cells having the structures CuInSe2-CdO and CuInSe 2-CdS-CdO have been fabricated on a cut or cleaved p-type Bridgman-grown CuInSe2 ingot. The CdO window layer in both cases was deposited by dc reactive sputtering. In the CuInSe2-CdS-CdO structures, the CdS interlayer was deposited by a solution growth method and these cells, incorporating the CdS interlayer, yielded a conversion efficiency of about 6.9%. By comparison, the cell with the structure CuInSe2-CdO, where the lattice mismatch between the CuInSe2 and the CdO is some 23%, showed a surprising efficiency of 6.8%. This result, indicating that the defect centers at the CuInSe2-CdO interface arising from the large lattice mismatch, play a smaller role than expected, suggests that the seat of photovoltaic action may lie away from the substrate-window layer interface as a buried homojunction within the CuInSe2. While the conversion efficiencies Of the two kinds of cells were similar, there were slight differences in their other characteristics whereby the device without the CdS interlayer had a higher illuminated open circuit voltage, lower short circuit current density, higher forward ideality factor above 2 and higher internal series resistance. The acceptor concentration of the stoichiometrically-prepared CuInSe 2 was estimated to be about 1017 cm-3 in the bulk of the wafers but almost an order of magnitude smaller than this near the surface after annealing in argon. Using the photocurrent-capacitance method, minority electron diffusion lengths in the CuInSe2 were estimated to be about 3 mum for the devices made with cleaved substrates and about half this value for the cells made with abrasively-polished substrates.</description><creator>Al-Quraini, Abdulmuti Awni.</creator><contributor>Champness, C.

Although not traditionally used as a modifier, calcium also has the potential to modify the eutectic silicon in Al-Si alloys. Metallographic observation and thermal analysis studies in A357 alloy indicate that. when the cooling rate is quite low. Ca modifies the eutectic silicon. but the effect of Ca as a modifier is not as strong as is Na or Sr. When the cooling rate is high, a fully modified structure can be obtained with calcium. Recovery of Ca in the melt is high and certain. It does not fade with long holding times. Moreover, a premodified ingot can be used, and even when such all ingot is remelted repeatedly there is no calcium loss. Calcium does increase porosity in castings. In general modification treatment with Ca improves mechanical properties, especially elongation. Calcium adversely interacts with strontium and reduces the ability of strontium as a modifier. Microstructural and thermal analysis studies show that Ca has a deleterious effect on Sr-modified castings and vice versa.

Supervisor support, and the effectiveness of family-friendly work place policies were explored. All agreed, that motherhood, has had a positive impact on practice including increased empathy and understanding, for both parents and children. The following workplace initiatives were determined to be helpful: flexible and predictable work hours; part-time options; and compressed-work-week. Despite half feeling unsupported by their supervisors, the majority indicated that they are managing well primarily due to flexible work hour scheduling. The attitude of supervisors, regarding the value of parenting, appears to be the key factor relating to their level of support. There was some indication of role conflict and much evidence of accommodation, including turning down supervisory/management positions, postponing education and restricting types of practice.</description><creator>Barkley, Patricia J.</creator><contributor>Davies, Linda (advisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Working mothers -- Canada.</subject><subject>Work and family -- Canada.</subject><subject>Women social workers -- Canada.</subject><title>Mothering and the social work profession : a multiple role analysis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v692t848f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2v23vw178</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:v405sc533</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:21:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Built on the ruins of earlier cities, the Mughal Emperor Shahjahan founded Shahjahanabad in 1639. Cradling a fort, the city expended itself down the social/housing strata to a wall. This wall not only brought coherence to any one group but provided an interaction amongst them. These cohesive units formed neighborhoods called mohallahs, marked by religious, economic and social liaisons, their identity legitimizing the power of certain individuals and institutions. The Palace-Complex formed the pinnacle in this urban hierarchy.

Continuing the traditional relationship to the theatre as well as to the harmonic proportions of the orders although recast in terms of the century in which he wrote, Le Camus uses the paradigm of the theatre as the space of reception for his architecture. Definitively establishing the conventions and taste of the theatre in eighteenth century France, Denis Diderot's The Paradox of Acting established the role of the poetic genius in relation to his or her audience. The relationship to the audience as enabled by the conventions of good taste allows for an understanding of Le Camus' unique analogy of architecture and the sensations, giving to his architecture the ability to provide a cathartic morality as put forth by Diderot.</description><creator>Macek, Daniel G.</creator><contributor>Perez-Gomez, Alberto (advisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Le Camus de Mézières, Nicolas, 1721-1789.</subject><subject>Architecture -- Philosophy.</subject><subject>Diderot, Denis, 1713-1784.</subject><title>Nicolas Le Camus de Mézières : at play in the hôtel</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/44558j48g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dv13zw677</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q237ht90v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:21:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis investigates the causes and consequences of intra-urban relocation of squatter settlements. The process of removal and resettlement of land invasions is analyzed in the light of past and contemporary experiences within the context of the developing countries, and a theoretical background is presented as a support for the main argument of the study. The urban network of Brasilia, the capital of Brazil, was selected as case study to illustrate the use of resettlement as a planning instrument and to discuss the impact that such undertakings bring upon the relocated communities. The study demonstrates how the development style adopted by the local government, which combines clearance and relocation of squatter settlements with a strong emphasis on peripheral development, has resulted in the formation of a highly dissociating environment, in which the practice of land invasion has become the primary strategy of poor dwellers to achieve land tenure.</description><creator>De Oliveira, Marcio N.</creator><contributor>Bhatt, Vikram (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Squatter settlements -- Brazil -- Brasília.</subject><title>The relocation of squatter settlements in Brasília /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1831cn07s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q237ht90v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q524jr01d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:21:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is devoted to an unsuccessful mission to Sofia undertaken in the fall of 1914 by Noel Buxton, a Liberal British M.P., who aimed to win Bulgaria over to the side of the Triple Entente.

Some, like Karol Berger, have pointed to ideological influences of the Polish emigration in Paris, while others, like James Parakilas, have given credit to the generic characteristics of the European literary ballad. In my own view, however, the most salient extra-musical factor in the background to Chopin's Ballades are Ballady, a series of poems by the 19th century Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz. After Chopin's death, Mickiewicz's Ballady were frequently associated with Chopin's Ballades, and in the first chapter I demonstrate this by examining the reception history of these works. In the next chapter I analyze the ideology of the Polish emigration in Paris, including prominent themes of alienation, powerlessness, morbid anxiety, pilgrimage, and nostalgia, which were used by that expatriate society to identify itself. Finally, in the third chapter, I trace analogies between these themes and their manifestations in Mickiewicz's Ballady. This analysis of Mickiewicz's poems forms the basis of my interpretation of Chopin's Second Ballade, where I discuss how certain textual and thematic features of the poems taken as a group can be mapped onto the form and musical discourse of the piano piece. In sum, although the associations between specific poems and Chopin's Ballades have been made by many authors, no one has distilled a single narrative archetype from the group of Mickiewicz's Ballady to apply to Chopin's works.</description><creator>Zakrzewska, Dorota.</creator><contributor>Huebner, Steven (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Chopin, Frédéric, 1810-1849.

Although he grew up in traditionalist circles, his experience studying at this institution and in Arabia, in conjunction with his wide reading on various subjects, gave him an open attitude to innovation, particularly in the field of education. The backwardness of pesantren graduates in mastering secular sciences, compared to those who graduated from the Dutch schools, inspired him to modernize the pesantren system. The introduction of the madrasah into the pesantren system, an institution designed to offer courses in the secular sciences as well as on Islam, was evidence of his progressive aim to enhance the quality of Muslim education, and the traditionalist version in particular. In the political arena, he played a significant role in the struggle for independence and the development of modern Indonesia. Known as a prominent leader who had a close contacts with kyais through the pesantren network, he was able to mobilize Indonesian Muslims against colonial rule. His moderate attitude, which colored his political behavior, was vital to efforts at achieving compromise and at bridging the differences between traditionalists on the one hand and modernists as well as secular nationalists on the other.</description><creator>Zaini, Achmad.</creator><contributor>Federspiel, Howard M.

(Zacour &amp; Zacour, 1991), on ninth grade students' wellness levels, and to evaluate student and teacher impressions of the program. Experimental groups (n = 62) from one urban and two suburban secondary schools participated in the four day 175 minute Looking Good...Feeling Great! program, while control groups (n = 37) from the same schools followed their regular academic schedules. All participants completed TestwellTM (National Wellness Institute, Inc., 1994), a wellness inventory for high school students, as a pretest, one week later as a posttest, and one and one half months later as a follow-up test. Student focus groups and teacher interviews were conducted after the posttest. Results showed that (a) experimental group wellness scores significantly increased from pretest to posttest (ES = .22), (b) experimental groups maintained their increased wellness levels one and one half months following completion of the program (ES = .24), and (c) there was no significant effect of gender on experimental group wellness scores, although females scored significantly higher than males overall. In general, students and teachers conveyed favourable impressions of the program. However, somewhat negative impressions of the program from the students and teacher at the urban secondary school imply that this type of school may benefit from a wellness program that better suits the needs of its constituents. The results indicate that the Looking Good...Feeling Great! program can be an effective tool in helping adolescents acquire healthy lifestyles through the enhancement of wellness levels.</description><creator>Wagstaff, Catherine A.</creator><contributor>Downey, Margaret J.

The thesis basically assumes that in its early development (1844--1848), the movement may be seen merely as religiously dissenting from the mainstream of Shi'i tradition. In the course of history, however, and especially after the Bab, its founder, claimed in 1848 to be the return of the Hidden Imam and proclaimed the abrogation of Qur'anic shari'a, the Babi movement showed radical tendencies, thus threatening the established religious and political authorities. This later development (1848--1853) was characterized by armed revolts by the Babis against the government troops. This thesis also examines the nature of Babi religious dissent and demonstrate that the Babi revolts were to a large extent based on religious motives.</description><creator>Fuad, Ahmad Nur.</creator><contributor>Lawson, Todd (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Shīʻah -- Iran -- History.</subject><subject>Iran -- Religion -- 19th century.</subject><subject>Babism -- History.</subject><title>The Bābī movement in Iran : from religious dissent to political revolt, 1844-1853</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zs25xb73p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9k41zg65k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Islamic Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sj139415d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:22:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This paper examines the tensions resulting from multiculturalism's quest to achieve equality through the recognition of cultural difference. The author argues that multiculturalism is inherently limited in its potential to recognize deep difference because it operates through the framework of the conceptual heritage of the Enlightenment's political project. Multiculturalism's dependence on Enlightenment evaluative norms means that difference and diversity can be recognized to the extent that they further the objective of achieving liberty and equality for all. The author examines the theoretical legacy of the Enlightenment as it informs the multicultural project and also analyses the impact of poststructuralist theory on multiculturalist conceptions of identity.</description><creator>Trinca, Alysha.</creator><contributor>Wood, Elizabeth (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Multicultural education.</subject><subject>Multiculturalism.</subject><subject>Enlightenment.</subject><title>Multiculturalism and the resignification of the Enlightenment tradition : implications for education</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20sv973.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sj139415d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Culture and Values in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g158bk36s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:22:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study examined the relationship between the physical fitness of National Hockey League (NHL) entry draft players and performance in the NHL. Physiological profiles were compared by level (NHL vs non-NHL) and position (forwards vs defense). The fitness level was determined by an assessment of body composition, anaerobic fitness, strength, power, muscular endurance, flexibility, and aerobic fitness. Subjects were 422 male hockey players, consisting of NHL entry draft (n = 310), minor league professional (n = 59) and NHL professional (n = 53) players. Results revealed that when drafted, physiological profiles of players who reach the NHL were significantly different from non-NHL players. Players that eventually made the NHL tended to be heavier and had higher peak power (W), mean power (W), VO2max (L/min), grip strength and leg power. The fitness variables in the test battery had low predictive power to identify players who played in the NHL. Physiological profiles of forwards were significantly different from defense. Defense were taller, heavier, and fatter than forwards. Defense had higher peak power (W), grip strength and leg power compared to forwards. The forwards were higher in VO2max when expressed relative to body weight. NHL entry draft players were lower in upper body strength than minor league professionals and NHL players.</description><creator>Trépanier, Alex.</creator><contributor>Montgomery, David (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Physical fitness.</subject><subject>Hockey players.</subject><subject>National Hockey League.</subject><title>Physiological characteristics and performance of NHL entry draft players</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k3569656s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g158bk36s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physical Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rn301352x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:22:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study seeks to confront the ontological crises of the subject. Through an examination of twentieth century texts (including fiction, autobiography and Freudian case studies), I demonstrate the effects of subjective compliance with disembodied discourses. Using psychoanalytic theory, I ask: What are the ethical limits of interpretation within the psychoanalysis and literary criticism? And what alternative strategies of intersubjective exchange could we employ that would aspire to avoid instances of such hermeneutic tyranny? Further, what evidence is there that the subject, in the face of overwhelming discursive compliance, continues attempting to realize its ontological status? My hypothesis is that while theory (i.e. discourse) may prove beneficial to the subject, it should not endeavour to prevent the subject itself from Being. Taking subjective ontology, and not liberation or self-representation, as the primary goal of interpretation, I explore means by which we may provide "good enough facilitating environments" for the subject.</description><creator>Szollosy, Michael.</creator><contributor>De-Munchy, Marike Finlay (advisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Criticism (Philosophy)</subject><subject>Discourse analysis.</subject><subject>Ontology in literature.</subject><title>"La théorie c'est bon mais ça n'empêche pas d'exister" : subjective ontology and the ethics of interpretation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k643b328v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rn301352x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bv73c281q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:22:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is devoted to the study of Bint al-Shat&amp;dotbelow;i''s method of interpreting the Qur'an. The problems of consistency in terms of her hermeneutical theory and of the application of this method represent the focus of the study. It furthermore discusses her attitude towards tendentious and i'jaz-misoriented interpretations of the Qur'an, of which both classical and modern exegetes are guilty in her eyes. Secondly, it studies how she applies her method in specific situations. The cross-referential method, and the concept of irtibat&amp;dotbelow; (interrelation between verses) are two major points to be analyzed. Finally, it also discusses her theory concerning the asbab al-nuzul (occasions of revelation), and its application. Using phenomenological, comparative and analytical methods of analysis, and by means of primary and secondary sources, the thesis concludes that Bint al-Shat&amp;dotbelow;i' in many cases is not consistent in applying the method she established.</description><creator>Syamsuddin, Sahiron.</creator><contributor>Boullata, Issa J.

In each of these he devotes several chapters to a discussion of the leadership of the Shi`i community since the days of `Ali b. Abi T&amp;dotbelow;alib. The study shows that both books under discussion were designed by al-Shahrastani to serve different purposes and were composed according to different methodologies. He takes completely different approaches to his treatment of Shi`i doctrine in al-Milal and the Nihaya. Acting as a "historian of religion" in al-Milal, the author shows considerable objectivity and avoids passing judgement. He supports his account of Shi`ism with arguments acknowledged by the Shi`is themselves. This is because al-Shahrastani intended al-Milal as a scientific and systematic account of religions. However, as a "theologian" he held certain of his own beliefs regarding several doctrinal problems, which he also wished to make it public. It was to serve this purpose that the Nihaya was composed. Furthermore, in this work the author does not hesitate to attack opinions different from his own, including the doctrine of imama.</description><creator>Syamsiyatun, Siti.</creator><contributor>Ormsby, Eric L.

It argues that impediment intrinsic to the narrative text affects the enunciative process of the work on various levels. The workings of impediment in Vechnyi muzh are examined on the levels of theme, genre---both in universal and historical terms---and narration. Frustrated reader expectation, uncertainty, and disorientation are shown to be symptomatic of impediment due to three factors: (1) thematic ambiguity on the basis of Dostoevskii's subversion in Vechnyi muzh of the theme of adultery, and of the cuckold motif; (2) genre ambivalence arising from mixed genre signals embedded in the text; (3) inhibited narrative assessment due to restrained narrative technique, and limited narrative perspective.</description><creator>Steiger, Krystyna.</creator><contributor>Bevaha, Laura (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, 1821-1881.

Beginning with an overview of British subcultural theory, it uses two examples of contemporary musical practice to provide alternative readings of cultural activity in a global cultural economy. Examining music scenes in Montreal as well as New Zealand music fans in North America, the following is a consideration of the construction of cultural communities across the globe it offers an analysis of the depth and scope of their interactions and how a range of cultural values and meanings are produced, distributed and consumed within those communities. Rather than seeing subcultures as geographically located in specific and discrete locales, I aim to illustrate how the various networks connecting them (whether they be affective alliances or computer-mediated communications) have in many ways realigned these communities along axes which differ from those proposed by earlier subcultural theories.</description><creator>Stahl, Geoff.</creator><contributor>Straw, Will (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Rock music -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</subject><subject>Rock music -- New Zealand</subject><subject>Rock music -- Social aspects -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</subject><subject>Subculture -- Case studies</subject><subject>Rock music -- Social aspects -- New Zealand</subject><title>Troubling below : rethinking subcultural theory</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0p096934b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s7526f44v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Graduate Communications Program</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3j333448f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:22:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is a critical examination of postmodernist pedagogy currently used in the education of visual artists. It is particularly concerned with the teaching of the traditional disciplines of painting and drawing within a postmodern context. My hypothesis is that the teaching of visual arts within a postmodern orientation more or less relies on an anti-aesthetic stance that is content-centered, with an insistence on critically and politically aware art. The overall objective of this thesis is twofold: First, to generate some questions and ideas that could be of assistance to post-secondary art instructors. Second, to establish a framework for an extended qualitative research that will address the impact of postmodernism on education of artists. The title "beyond the anti-aesthetic" does not necessarily present itself as a negation of the postmodernist paradigm. It identifies a need to revitalize visual art instruction within the postmodern model, to re-address the interplay between form and content in visual art and enhance critical thinking.</description><creator>Spičanović, Vladimir.</creator><contributor>White, Boyd (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Aesthetics, Modern -- 20th century.</subject><subject>Art -- Study and teaching -- Philosophy.</subject><subject>Postmodernism and education.</subject><title>Beyond the anti-aesthetic</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2801pj44k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3j333448f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Culture and Values in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rb68xd91r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:22:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The first part of this M.A. thesis is composed of four stories whose common thread is memory.

This formula is analyzed with regard to the feminist critique of pornography and the assertions of gay advocates. Although the Falcon formula supports the feminist perspective with respect to the representations of sex practices, the linkage between femininity and getting fucked, as indicated by Dworkin, was not found in the selected Falcon videos. In fact, Falcon videos subvert this linkage by depicting masculine men fucking other masculine men. And, in accord with the claims of gay advocates, Falcon videos largely represent gay men having sex as opposed to straight men having homosexual sex. The Falcon formula appears to have developed not only in reaction to stigmatizing stereotypes of effeminate gay men and in reaction to the linkage between femininity and getting fucked, but also in response to the fantasy (of gay viewers) of being accepted into an exclusively male community.</description><creator>Siroonian, Jason.</creator><contributor>Rains, Prue (advisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Sex in popular culture.</subject><subject>Erotic videos.</subject><subject>Masculinity in popular culture.</subject><subject>Gay men -- Sexual behavior.</subject><subject>Falcon Studios.</subject><title>Gay pornographic videos : the emergent Falcon formula</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/db78tf22s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h415pc697</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Sociology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1c18dh846</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:22:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This is an attempt at construing descriptions of cognitive activities found in the Neiye, an early Chinese text (fourth century BCE) preserved in the Guanzi compilation. Through the notions of metaphor and cognitive model, and by means of hermeneutic principles developed by George Lakoff and other theorists, I scrutinize the text, trying to unravel the peculiar understanding of the cognitive functioning of the body upon which it is predicated. I focus on four words: xin (heart), shen (spirit), qi (breath), and qing (emotions). As a result of this enquiry, the physicality of cognitive activities in the Neiye stands out clearly. The importance of the body in cognitive activities should appear as clearly in translations if we want to get closer to the Chinese understanding of their own writings instead of reading them through categories which only make sense in our own constructed reality, our Lebenswelt.</description><creator>Simonis, Fabien.</creator><contributor>Yates, Robin D.
