Restricted to latino-american literature for ones, open to all literatures for others, this style suffers from a lack of unanimity. This is the reason why I have chosen to begin my thesis with a panoramic view of this style and identify its founders. Subsequently, I will try to establish the distinctions between Magic and Marvelous Realism through the thesis of Charles Scheel and Ook Chung. Those precisions made, I shall analyse the presence of Marvelous Realism in Ferron's Contes with the stylistic and/or structural traits of Mary-Ellen Ross, Charles Scheel, Cecilia Ponte and Irlemar Chiampi among others.

In Food, four graduate students, all to varying degrees perverse, come together in a cabalistic union. Bored and desperate, they begin to transgress a series of taboos, eventually performing communal acts of aggression, murder, and even cannibalism. Frank West, one of the students, is the novel's narrator and questionable moral center. It is through his confession that the four's "monstrous deeds" are filtered through. Thematically, Food examines the potential for evil in individuals, as well as the group dynamics which encourage such acts of violence to erupt. The required critical afterward looks at cannibalism as a literary trope in Food and Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, discussing how the athropophagous act can be read as a symbolic one, simultaneously creating and destroying boundaries between various dichotomies (such as eater/eaten or self/other) related to notions of identity.</description><creator>Aguirre-Sacasa, Roberto.</creator><contributor>Ponech, Trevor (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Literature, American.</subject><title>Food of the Gods</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n583xw95t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p8418q16d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qb98mh48t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:06:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The prevailing metaphysics of modern medicine and bioethics have been largely dualistic and materialistic in nature. The person is conceived of as a duality of mind and body, where the body is treated simply as a material object. In taking such a perspective, the background is set from which people can come to feel distanced from their bodies and believe it acceptable to alienate and sell their body parts. This thesis argues that the dualistic (and to a lesser extent the materialistic) conceptions of the person have contributed significantly to the objectification and commodification of the body. A most disturbing example of this is the patenting of human genetic material. In place of the dualistic metaphysic, an embodiment perspective is proposed that treats the person as a unique individual who is inseparably unified in mind, body, and soul. This view can help address the problem of patenting and commercialisation as it avoids the difficulties raised by the application of property language to the body. The body is not simply an object that can be bought or sold, but is an integral part of a person's identity. This does not mean that medical research must be prohibited, but simply that an individual's cells and any derivative cell lines should not be subject to patents. Above all, an embodiment perspective forces the medical and technological establishment, and society in general, to accept that people are unique unified individuals who cannot be objectified, commodified, or alienated from their bodies and selves.</description><creator>Williams-Jones, Bryn.</creator><contributor>Keyserlingk, Edward W.

In particular, it considers the historical context from which the gourmet rises and how "good taste" is communicated through the history of the gourmet. This finds particular expression in mass mediated society, specifically print culture, and reaches its apex in Gourmet: The magazine of good living. By disciplining base instincts such as civilizing the appetite, making distinctions from the masses, the everyday and the ordinary, "good taste" is standardized through the palate and acts as an index of the aesthetic quality of bourgeois sensibility. Gastronomic history, notions of restraint and delicacy from the French courts, and the development of the modern restaurant, are food for thought in the examination of contemporary associations between "good taste" and "good living."

Listening to the voices of protest in women's ancient songs will not only keep women in touch with the long history of their struggle, but will also return worth and importance to the devalued oral narratives that have been the repositories of women's knowledge and experience for centuries. Education programs that grow out of the rich and varied material of folk songs will, by definition, deal with the issues that are repeatedly raised, like embroidered patterns, in the songs themselves. Family, love, child-rearing and the myriad problems of fulfilling personal desire within the confinements of patriarchy will all, under scrutiny, yield crucial subject matter for education programs. At the same time, spinning new folksongs out of old ones will challenge women to think critically, and with the creativity essential to reworking our cultures so that both women and men are able to realize themselves more wholly.</description><creator>Varma, Anushree.</creator><contributor>Ghosh, Ratna (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Music in education.</subject><subject>Women -- Education -- India.</subject><title>The embroidered word : using traditional songs to educate women in India</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1544br45z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4q77ft420</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Culture and Values in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9g54xk58x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:06:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis undertakes a comprehensive examination of the effects of a variety of social, phonological and morphosyntactic factors on the process of s-weakening in the Spanish of San Miguel, El Salvador. The corpus used in this study consists of sixteen speakers native to San Miguel, evenly distributed according to age, sex and socioeconomic status. It was found that s-weakening appears to be in stable variation and that it is primarily governed by phonological factors: the quality of the segment following the /s/, the position of the /s/ in the syllable and word, and whether the /s/ is in a stressed or an unstressed syllable. Regarding the quality of the following segments, it was found that coronal stops caused /s/ to resist weakening. Consequently, it is argued that /st/ and /sd/ sequences are partial geminates in this dialect of Spanish, i.e. they share a place node. An account of the phonological factors conditioning s-weakening is provided within the framework of Optimality Theory, utilising the notion of crucially unranked constraints.</description><creator>Taler, Vanessa.</creator><contributor>Goad, Heather (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Auger, Julie (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Spanish language -- Phonology.</subject><subject>Spanish language -- Dialects -- El Salvador -- San Miguel.</subject><title>S-weakening in the Spanish of San Miguel, El Salvador</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qn59q6158.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9g54xk58x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Linguistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qn59q616j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:06:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis consists of De'ath Sound, a short poetic novel (of approximately 27,000 words), and Check Your Sex at the Door, a critical postface. In the novel, traditional notions of plot and character fracture, and the underlying story, a kind of impulsion towards plot, plays itself out in ambiguous, even disturbing ways. The work itself, much shorter than a traditional novel, shares some of the sensibilities and structures of a long poem. The use of repetition, recurrent imagery, and the rhythm of sound, informs the narrative. The postface, intimately connected with the fictional text, employs language, syntax, and rhythms of speech which echo those used in the fictional text. As in any good work of fiction, language is privileged, suffusing and even disrupting form and content.</description><creator>Stone, Anne, 1969-</creator><contributor>Westphal, Sarah (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Literature, Canadian (English).</subject><title>De'ath Sound</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kh04dr59g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qn59q616j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2r36v055m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:06:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This Master's thesis examines the status of myth and symbol in postmodern religious discourse, and proposes a new way of understanding representation in religion. The first chapter deals with the sense of symbol as it emerged out of literary and philosophical romanticism, and explores several divergent interpretations of the meaning of the symbol according to modernist and structuralist criticism. The second chapter, after analysing the function of myth and history in religious understanding, connects the romantic symbol to a contemporary hermeneutics based on the aesthetic and epistemological tenets of magic realism. It is my contention in this thesis that magic realism, in its conflation (and deconstruction) of the ideologically charged dichotomy of myth and reality, provides a hermeneutical tool with which to critique demythologization; and that, in its dual aspect as heir to both romanticism and realism, magic realism may be a more fertile source than either neo-romanticism or post-structuralism for a truly postmodern religious criticism.</description><creator>Shields, James Mark.</creator><contributor>Roberts-Skerrett, Kathleen (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Symbolism.</subject><subject>Magic realism (Literature)</subject><subject>Romanticism -- Religious aspects.</subject><subject>Myth.</subject><title>The lure of disillusion : toward a reappraisal of realism in religious understanding</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ft848s492.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36v055m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Religious Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3n204116d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:06:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Nietzsche urges us not to embrace any one perspective of the world, at the same time as he vociferously and repeatedly attacks whole ways of life. These two aspects of Nietzsche's work seem to be in tension with one another--what perspective allows Nietzsche to be so opinionated? Nietzsche insists that all experience is from a perspective and that there is no inherently privileged perspective. This is the "perspectivist" Nietzsche that Derrida focuses on. Yet not only does Nietzsche insist on denigrating the perspective of others, he seems to acknowledge that such attacks are not very worthwhile if they too are just from another perspective. Thus thinkers like Schacht argue that there is a privileged perspective in Nietzsche, and that this privilege is unique because of the relationship it has with the "natural" and the "healthy." The Gay Science presents a Nietzsche who integrates these two seemingly incompatible positions, for in this work Nietzsche makes an exciting synthesis possible through the idea of the eternal recurrence and through his attack on the unitary self. Nietzsche urges us to create ourselves as affirmers, but the stance of affirmation is not in itself a perspective; rather, a central characteristic of affirmers is the ability to embrace numerous perspectives.</description><creator>Shanske, Darien.</creator><contributor>Buckley, Philip (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm, 1844-1900 -- Contributions in philosophy of the self.</subject><subject>Self (Philosophy) -- History.</subject><title>Nietzsche on becoming a self worth being</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128ng68q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3n204116d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Philosophy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3r074x22w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:06:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Family and Community Medicine was introduced to Costa Rica through the McGill-CENDEISSS Project of 1989-1994. The development of this new speciality is interpreted as a "professionalization" drive, which, while appropriating the discourse of the international primary health care movement, in fact places more importance, as a social movement, on negotiating for and expanding its own jurisdictional space. Two bodies of literature are called upon to provide theoretical guidance, namely, writing on "professionalization" and ethnographic interpretations of "development" in the so-called Third World. The phenomenon of Family and Community Medicine in Costa Rica is described as an international, national, and local movement.

The analysis of typical narrative, descriptive and dialogal techniques used by the author brings to the fore at once the textual sites in which Gary's central precept, the univocity of meaning, is upheld, and the presence of ambiguities that undermine it. Likewise, the analysis of the novel's socio-historical context highlights its ideological dimensions, which is both inherent to the work and responsible for certain indeterminacies that foreclose the possibility of a unique meaning. Finally, it is shown that the rhetorical figures in Gary's text, which are designed, by their overwhelming presence, to forcefully reconfirm the univocity of meaning, also generate a series of equivocations. This thesis demonstrates that while Le grand vestiaire is indeed based on literary techniques that ensure its effectiveness, the novel is at odds with Gary's poetics and ultimately represents its functional ineffectiveness.</description><creator>Roy, Hugo.</creator><contributor>Lane-Mercier, Gillian (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Persuasion (Rhetoric)</subject><subject>Gary, Romain.

The importance of bronze in Shang and Zhou society and the vast quantity of bronze artifacts recovered indicates that the acquisition of metal ore would have been a major occupation of the state. The Shang and Zhou governments controlled their own bronze foundries but did not control the mines. The mines are located in southern China where the Chu state flourished during the Eastern Zhou period, likely due partly to their possession of mineral resources, and in Inner Mongolia where the steppe cultures existed. The Zhou and the Shang were likely obtaining raw materials from southern and northern cultures, either through trade or raid. Provenance studies based on chemical composition of artifact and ore will help resolve the source of Shang and Zhou ore.</description><creator>Reinhardt, Katrinka.</creator><contributor>Trigges, Bruce (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Yates, Robin (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Ikawa-Smith, Fumiko (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>China -- Politics and government -- To 221 B.C.</subject><subject>Bronze age -- China.</subject><subject>Smelting -- China -- History.</subject><subject>Copper mines and mining -- China -- History.</subject><title>Mining and smelting technology and the politics of bronze in Shang and Western Zhou China : an inquiry into the Bronze Age interaction sphere</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cz30pv61z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j3860891h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of East Asian Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zw12z7347</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:06:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this thesis is to explore the interplay of exegesis and ideology in the variety of Jewish medieval interpretation to Exodus 33:12-23. This thesis examines the intersection of ideology at three stages of the exegetical process. In the first stage, the commentator singles out "difficulties" in the biblical text. In the second stage, the commentator proposes formal solutions to these textual problems which provide a conceptual framework in which to introduce exegetical content. Finally, there are the actual comments themselves which provide the reservoir of exegetical content from which to glean the ideological tendencies of a particular commentator. The term "interplay" indicates the dynamic aspect of the relationship between exegesis and ideology and refers to the manner in which a commentator's ideological views influence his exegetical considerations and vice-versa. Contrasting various schools of exegesis to the biblical unit will sharpen the distinctive ideological positions of each author.</description><creator>Rand, Dan.</creator><contributor>Kaplan, Lawrence (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Religion, Biblical Studies</subject><title>The interplay of exegesis and ideology in the Jewish medieval interpretations Exodus 33:12-23 /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f1881p00r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zw12z7347</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Jewish Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9593tx13s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:06:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Book of Mercy (1984) occupies a central place in the career of Leonard Cohen, as comparison to a wide variety of Cohen "texts," from poetry, the novel and song to the personal interview and music video, reveals. Interviews and book reviews contemporary with Book of Mercy indicate that the latter contains a sincere message of faith and prophetic warning that Cohen publicly defends. Cohen's eclectic but reverent incorporation of language and ideas from Judaeo-Christian traditions of prayer and mysticism shows his regard for the sacred expression of his predecessors. As a result, Book of Mercy stands slightly apart from the rest of Cohen's oeuvre, yet it is not simply an anomaly. Instead, it forms an integral part of a prolonged narrative of spiritual desire that began in 1956 with Cohen's first book of poetry and has continued through to his latest album, The Future (1992) and a recent poem, "On the Path." Book of Mercy marked a renewed sense of artistic vocation and conviction in the work of Leonard Cohen that remains unshaken today.</description><creator>Pezzarello, Christopher Joseph.</creator><contributor>Trehearne, Brian (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Cohen, Leonard, 1934- Book of Mercy.</subject><title>"You have sweetened your word" : sincerity and prayer in Leonard Cohen's Book of Mercy</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7d278w264.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9593tx13s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pn89d857x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:06:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The main purpose of the present investigation was to compare the personality traits of cegep students enrolled in arts, sciences, and social sciences. In addition, the influence of gender on personality was examined, as well as its interaction with academic specialization. Finally, exploratory research was conducted to study the influence of selected socio-demographic variables on personality configuration. Participants were asked to complete a socio-demographic questionnaire as well as the French research translation of the NEO-Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI), which measures the five basic dimensions of personality. Thus, another purpose of this study was to provide validational information for the latter instrument. Results indicated that arts students score significantly lower on Extraversion than science and social science students. Furthermore, females were shown to score significantly higher than males on measures of Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Conscientiouness. In addition, the interaction of program specialization and gender was shown to be significant on the Openness to experience scale. Exploratory research indicated that students whose parents have a higher occupational level scored significantly higher than other students on measures of Openness to experience. Finally, the internal consistency of each scale and correlations between the scales of the instrument were calculated. The implications of our results were subsequently discussed, as well as potential issues for future research.</description><creator>Paquet-Gagnon, Anabel.</creator><contributor>Rejskind, Gillian (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Junior college students -- Québec (Province) -- Psychology.</subject><title>Personality measures and academic specialization in cegep students</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rb68xd700.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pn89d857x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:t722hb81n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:06:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The 60th Royal American Regiment was raised in an attempt to combine the qualities of a frontiersman and a trained soldier. This paper presents an in-depth look at the conditions which revealed a need to meet the challenges of frontier warfare. The specialized training, outfitting, and tactical education of this regiment, its performance in battle situations, and its ensuing impact on training and tactics throughout the army are all considered. The primary focus of this paper is the Royal American Regiment's performance in North America in the battles of the Seven Year's War, and above all its decisive involvement in the Pontiac Rebellion. Discussion of these engagements presents the thesis that the Royal American Regiment was at the forefront of a movement in training reform that helped add a new dimension to the British Army.</description><creator>Marston, Daniel P.</creator><contributor>Senior, Hereward (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Great Britain.

(1988; 1989). Model plausibility was assessed by fitting both models to a word repetition and a synonym generation rCBF PET dataset using methods based on the examination of interregional correlations, and structural equation modeling. Physiologically-based regions of interest were defined a priori through a review of PET activation literature. The current study demonstrated (1) the feasibility of using a priori defined physiological regions of interest in model evaluation, (2) the advantages of using structural equation modeling over interregional correlations, and (3) that neither model proved to be a particularly good fit to the data.</description><creator>Nikelski, Erwin James.</creator><contributor>Petitto, Laura (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Zatorre, Robert (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Neurolinguistics.</subject><subject>Tomography, Emission.</subject><title>Combining positron emission tomography (PET) data with neuroanatomical constraints : comparing models of single-word processing</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k0698950w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b8515q44t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3t945s812</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:06:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This inquiry examines the relationship between studio drawing instruction and art theory, by reviewing practical and theoretical art books, questioning peers, and conducting a focus group encounter. The resulting data, interpreted in light of 25 years of teaching experience, suggests that the chronology of exercises in all the reviewed drawing texts encourages a widespread use of outlining at the expense of a concentration on rendering mass and volume. In response to changing demands on art teachers, the author proposes an outline for an updated studio drawing manual which synthesizes theory and practice by addressing compatible themes, and proposes a chronology of effective exercises which enhance student understanding and capacity to render volume and mass. The author concludes that the field of teaching drawing can be expanded to reflect visual, spiritual and ethical concerns, and that reestablishing the primacy of the visual to the teaching of the visual arts is best achieved in a hospitable setting where the standards and validity of the discipline can be established according to visual criteria, and not remote theory.</description><creator>Nash, Joanna, MA.</creator><date>1997</date><subject>Drawing -- Study and teaching.</subject><title>The praxis of teaching drawing /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jh343v03z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3t945s812</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Culture and Values in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8w32r755g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:06:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The evolution of the fantastic short story has followed a similar path as contemporary short story and also took inspiration from many literary forms. As a result, it has undergone profound changes since the 19$ rm sp{th}$ century. And yet, studies of this genre are just beginning to break away from the thematic interpretation originally designed to provide a temporary solution to an experimentation problem. The study of a selection of short stories by Julio Cortazar, very representative of these neo-fantastic tangents allows us to observe the techniques which the fantastic genre can now be based upon. The second part of this thesis is made up of an anthology of short stories based for the most part on the fantastic.

It was learned that female engineers with children are as committed to their careers as childless female engineers. Moreover, there is no difference in income or job status between these two groups. There is also no significant difference in income between male and female engineers when controlling for employment status, degree, job status and experience. However, female engineers are not found in management positions as often as their male colleagues, even after controlling for experience. This lower job status, in turn, affects the women's incomes. A reason for the lower status of female engineers is likely due to engineering being very male-dominated. No such difference in job status exists in the field of computer science, where the proportion of women is much higher.</description><creator>Moorcroft, Karen.</creator><contributor>Rytina, Steven (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Women in engineering.</subject><subject>Women engineers -- Employment.</subject><subject>Women computer programmers -- Employment.</subject><title>Equity among male and female engineers</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bn999861r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4t64gq274</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Sociology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:v118rg46f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:06:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Canada's post-Confederation economy was marked by a search for capital that was used to complete large infrastructure projects such as the Canadian Pacific Railway. Since Canada's small tax base could not pay for the transcontinental railway, financiers in the City of London were the first choice as a source for this capital by the Canadian government. As P. J. Cain and A. G. Hopkins explained in British Imperialism: Innovation and Expansion, however, the ability to tap this resource was dependent on the gentlemanly credentials of the government's representative because the City's social culture was dominated by ideals of "propertied wealth", family connections and social activity. Sir John A. Macdonald's Conservatives, therefore, installed a representative in London that possessed these gentlemanly qualities in the hopes of securing capital for the completion of the CPR and promoting Canada's interests in the London business community. Three men between 1869 and 1885 served as Canada's High Commissioner. Sir John Rose, Sir Alexander Tilloch Galt and Sir Charles Tupper were all chosen for their apparent gentlemanly qualities. The men used these qualities with varying success to promote and eventually secure the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway.</description><creator>McElrea, Patrick D.</creator><contributor>Miller, Carman (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Canada -- Foreign relations -- Great Britain.</subject><subject>Great Britain -- Foreign relations -- Canada.</subject><subject>Railroads -- Canada -- History -- 19th century.</subject><subject>Canada.

During these years the British controlled Iraq under a mandate granted by the League of Nations. This, in spite of the simultaneous creation of an Iraqi monarchy. Neither the new monarch nor the people were content with the political arrangement, based as it was on foreign control, but the drive for independence emanated from a small group of political activists. Both major religious sects of Islam, Sunni and Shi'a, played a leading role in the nationalist movement; in fact, the movement cannot be understood without an appreciation of Islam, and its major variations, in Iraqi life. A historical background highlights the conditions which allowed Iraqism to take precedent over Arabism after the war and examines the reactions of Iraqis to the invasion by modern conquerors and their later occupation. Additionally, it provides a chronological account of the important events during the mandate period and the buildup of Iraqi resentment of foreign control which precipitated their demand for self-government. This thesis is a broad study of the nascent nationalist movement in postwar Iraq which engaged in a desperate battle to transform a mandated territory into a sovereign state. Focus is on the role religion played in its beginnings and on the contribution of both Shi'is and Sunnis whose combined and independent efforts led to the formation of modern Iraq.</description><creator>Lockwood-Drummond, V.

The grip of New Historicism now holds tightly enough, perhaps, to the point where it suffers from a lack of attention to formalist, aesthetic, stylistic differentials and peculiarities. A critical position, then, that addresses this lack of attention looks to be an assessment of the relationships between New Historicism and formalism: how, in fact, New Historicism owes a debt to the formalist ways of reading it works to overcome. Such ways of reading find one of their most powerful statements in Keats himself--and, in a startlingly close twentieth-century analogue, the reader-response theory of Wolfgang Iser. The readings here of Keats's poetry consider how it reveals that Keats, like Iser, holds the germ of New Historicism's methodology, as it falls under the general taxonomy of Iser's theory but for how it actually dramatizes and predicts that theory. Reading, for Keats, ultimately places one in a dynamic relationship with history--a relationship always of potential, perpetually "widening speculation" to "ease the Burden of the Mystery" that is history.</description><creator>Johnstone, Michael, 1971-</creator><contributor>Kaufman, Robert (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Keats, John, 1795-1821 -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><subject>Criticism.</subject><subject>Historicism.</subject><title>Breathing eyes : Keats and the dynamics of reading</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1544br47h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bk128c89z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:j6731595v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:07:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Sport is a particularly ideologically-charged terrain within contemporary gender relations because it is centered on the body. The body is our most 'natural' marker of sexual identity, and thus, in our socio-cultural imaginations, of gender identity. Accordingly, gendered boundaries in sport have traditionally constructed and promoted an ideology of 'natural' gender differences, and sport is a site--a microcosm--where traditional beliefs and assumptions about female weakness and male strength are promoted and maintained. Sport is understood to be both reflective as well as indicative of the female/male dichotomy which exists in the more general social mythology. Gendered boundaries are constructed, and work to ideologically contain the female athlete. However, these boundaries are also the ideological seams, through which one can potentially challenge the normalizing processes of sport.</description><creator>Kay, Joanne.</creator><contributor>Robinson, G.
