Fertilizers included K$ sb2$SO$ sb4$, a phosphate and base cations mix, and a commercial organic mix (Maplegro). No effect of fertilization was found on foliar nutrient concentrations and water status of trees during the 1990 growing season. This is possibly the result of dilution in tree biomass, the addition of non limiting nutrients or the experimental design. A positive effect of fertilization on growth was found for one site and, at another, fertilization was found to impair growth. Thus fertilization requirements of declining sugar maple are site specific. Soil Mg was higher around trees fertilized with Maplegro, and trees fertilized with K$ sb2$SO$ sb4$ had low leaf buffering capacities.</description><creator>Helle, Janos K.</creator><contributor>Cote, Benoit (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Sugar maple -- Growth.</subject><subject>Sugar maple -- Fertilizers.</subject><title>Effect of fertilization on growth, nutrient status and leaf water potential of sugar maple</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2j62s694j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6m311r48s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:j6731608q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:08:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A community health survey was conducted in Karachi, Pakistan, with three objectives: first, to estimate maternal mortality using the sisterhood method; second, to describe current fertility and family planning trends; and third, to determine which factors are associated with the utilization of prenatal care. The study population of 2,897 households was chosen randomly from the catchment area of the three maternity hospitals of the Aga Khan Health Services of Pakistan. Data were collected using household interviews of all married women less than 55 years of age. Results show a maternal mortality estimate of 153 deaths per 100,000 live births and perinatal mortality of 30/1000. Strong declining trends in fertility and increased utilization of prenatal care were documented in this urban population, in contrast to recent national survey data. After adjustment for socioeconomic factors and confounding variables, maternal education and perceived importance of prenatal care were found to be important predictors of the utilization of maternal health care. The majority of families in this population utilize the private sector for family planning and pregnancy care. The study demonstrates the importance of maternal education and attitudes in promoting utilization of adequate maternal health care, and documents the emerging role of the private sector in the provision of maternal health services in Karachi.</description><creator>Hagen, Catherine A.</creator><contributor>Hanley, J.

In a series of experiments it is shown that subjects do not perform rapid, goal-directed flexion and extension movements equally accurately in different parts of the elbow's workspace. In these experiments, movements of 10, 20 and 30 degrees in amplitude were tested using up to five different initial elbow angles. When performing flexions, subjects tended to overshoot targets when starting from extended positions, to undershoot targets when starting from more flexed positions, and to perform relatively accurate movements when starting from the centre of the workspace. Final position accuracy was more variable for extensions. When reliable differences existed for extensions, subjects tended to produce a pattern of results opposite to that of flexions: subjects overshot targets when starting from flexed positions and undershot targets when starting from more extended positions. A model of elbow movement based on the $ lambda$ version of the equilibrium-point hypothesis was used to assess the extent to which the pattern of errors obtained in the empirical studies could be reproduced by a control scheme that does not adjust commands in response to changing musculo-skeletal geometry, but rather uses one single invariant command throughout the workspace. The motivation for testing the invariant command notion was to explore the possibility that motion planning might be achieved without an explicit representation of musculo-skeletal geometry. Predicted patterns of final position errors across the workspace matched empirically obtained error patterns for flexions, but the model performed less well when predicting the pattern of errors observed for extension movements.</description><creator>Gribble, Paul L.</creator><contributor>Ostry, David (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Elbow -- Movements.</subject><subject>Joints -- Range of motion.</subject><subject>Human mechanics.</subject><title>Musculo-skeletal geometry and the control of single degree of freedom elbow movements</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tt44pq14k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bn9998710</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rx913r916</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:08:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Irregular problems arise in many areas of computational physics and other scientific applications. A parallel solution for such a problem requires a suitable mapping strategy to map the irregular problem to the interconnection topology of the parallel machine so that communication overhead is as low as possible, there is proper load balancing among the processors and, locality of the problem graph is preserved. As a result, there is sufficient speedup in computation. In this thesis, we discuss some general strategies and associated results in data-parallel solutions of such problems. Some of these strategies use the geometrical co-ordinates of the nodes of the problem graph for partitioning them to the processors. In certain situations, geometrical co-ordinates alone may not capture the topology of the problem graph. To handle this, we design a number of schemes for assigning topological co-ordinates to nodes, and then use the same mapping strategies for partitioning nodes to processors based on their topological co-ordinates. We test our strategies on experimental problem graphs and discuss the results.</description><creator>Goswami, Dhrubajyoti</creator><contributor>Panangaden, Prakash (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Data parallel solution strategies for irregular problems</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128ng78z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rx913r916</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hx11xg90b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:08:34Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this thesis is the determination of a minimum market price for Short-Rotation Forestry (SRF) willow biomass grown in monoculture and windbreaks in Quebec and Ontario. Full cost budgeting was used and developed on a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Harvest cycles of 3 and 4 years for monoculture plantations, and 8 years for windbreaks were investigated. Estimates for establishment and other preharvest costs were obtained from mid-sized (5 hectares) commercial SRF willow plots in Quebec and Ontario. For the monoculture plantations, irrespective of cycle length, and using the base case figures, the final delivery cost of willow biomass ranged between 74-126 $/odMg and 63--109 $/odMg based on current and projected costs respectively. These hold for yields between 7 and 11 odMg/ha/yr. Moreover, the 4-year cycle was revealed to be more economically efficient than a 3-year cycle. Along with yield, the main cost factors affecting the economics of SRF monoculture plantations are: harvesting, transportation to a processing plant, land lease management. For the two major energy markets, ethanol and electricity production (biomass in replacement of coal), SRF willow biomass in monoculture plantations does not appear to be a viable feedstock given present technology and yields. In the short run, a more promising outlet for willow biomass is space heat production for small buildings, farm complexes, etc. In this market, many potential buyers can afford to pay a higher price for biomass than ethanol or electricity utilities. In the windbreak system, biomass could be produced for between 44 and 68 $/odMg, assuming that yields between 12 to 20 odMg/ha/yr can be achieved. At this price, windbreak biomass is not a competitive feedstock for ethanol or electricity generation, but is attractive for space heat production.

This study aimed to evaluate new objective measures of vestibular function by determining (1) how these measures relate to subjective clinical estimates of vestibular function and (2) whether these measures can identify patients with true vestibular dizziness. Net $ {$slow-phase + saccadic$ }$ gaze stabilization and active comfortable torsal-head rotation were used to objectively characterize vestibulo-ocular and vestibulospinal function, respectively, in 39 dizzy patients and 30 normals. Blinded clinical ranking of apparent vestibular function of the patients was obtained from history and clinical examination. It was found (1) that clinical rankings were significantly correlated (r$ rm sb{s}$:0.39, p $&lt;$ 0.02) to a new objective parameter based on both vestibulo-ocular and vestibulospinal measures, and (2) that an objective measure of both vestibulo-ocular and vestibulospinal function permitted most dizzy patients and normal subjects to be identified (sensitivity: 87%, specificity: 83%).</description><creator>Fuoco, Gabriel</creator><contributor>Segal, Bernard (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><title>Objective and clinical assessment of vestibular function using new vestibulo-ocular and vestibulospinal tests : net gaze stabilization and active comfortable torsal-head rotation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hx11xg91m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v979v5012</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physiology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wh246v07t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:08:35Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis examines the efficiency of the price discovery mechanism in small regional markets utilizing the feed grain markets in the Maritime Provinces of Canada as a case study. Through the application of the Law of One Price (LOP), price transmission symmetry and Vector Error Correction Models (VEC), the author determined the price relationships that exist between the feed grain market in the Maritime Provinces and those in Western and Central Canada as external sources of supply. The results suggest that there exists a relatively high degree of arbitrage between Maritime feed grain prices and those of Thunder Bay or Chatham for equivalent quality, price transmission being strictly from West to East. Although the LOP hypothesis must be rejected in the short run, in most cases, it was found to hold in the long run. Local markets appear to be highly integrated and price adjustment occurs within a period of four to six weeks, generally corresponding to the lead time of feed grain orders and transportation from Western Canada. A price transmission analysis found no evidence of the exercise of market power in the pricing of local grain. In general, the pricing of local grains in the Maritimes may be judged as efficient considering that the lag in price response corresponds to the replacement period for Western grains.</description><creator>Froment, Gilles</creator><contributor>Coffin, H.

This work investigates the physiological aspects of protein accumulation potential in barley grain. A recently developed perfusion system was used in four experiments conducted in 1993 and 1994. In the field experiment, plants were allowed to take up urea at 15 or 30 mM N, or ethephon at 15 $ mu$ M. Abscisic acid and 2,4-D decreased total seed weight spike$ sp{-1}$. Gibberellic acid and 2,4-D increased seed protein concentration and content, while ABA decreased both of these. Kinetin and abscisic acid treatments resulted in the highest and lowest levels, respectively for flag leaf photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration and intercellular CO$ sb2$ concentration. Both protein content spike$ sp{-1}$ and seed protein concentration were elevated in plants fertilized with 10.7 mM N via the soil and plants perfused with 30 mM N via the peduncle. Plants receiving treatments of 10.7 mM N from the soil and mixture of 30 mM N and GA$ sb3$ or 2,4-D through the peduncle had increased protein content seed$ sp{-1}$, and the highest seed weight spike$ sp{-1}$, respectively. Peduncle perfusion with 30 mM N increased spike protein concentration and content and grain protein concentration without affecting seed weight spike$ sp{-1}$. Grain protein concentration was increased by peduncle perfusion with ethephon. The perfusion technique worked well under field conditions.

Bulls were ranked based on different degrees of NPPC (Uptakes of 0, 1, 2, and 3 or more latex beads), using the solutions coming from an animal model. A total of 42,103 first lactation records, collected from 1985 through 1993 in 2,919 Quebec dairy herds, were used to obtain EBV's for SCC and for log SCC (LogSCC) for 697 sires. Correlations between NPPC measurements and somatic cell EBV's were null. Canadian official ETA's for type traits related with mammary system had a tendency of being positively correlated with higher NPPC and negatively with Uptake-0. Canadian official ETA's for production traits were negatively correlated with higher NPPC and positively with Uptake-0. A total of 17,202 first lactation records of daughters of the 25 AI bulls were used to study the effect of NPPC and log SCC on survival in dairy cows. Survival after first lactation was more closely related to sires' NPPC-EBV's than to LogSCC-EBV.</description><creator>Dürr, João Walter</creator><contributor>Monardes, Humberto Gonzalo (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Neutrophils -- Immunology.</subject><subject>Dairy cattle -- Genetics.</subject><subject>Mastitis -- Immunological aspects.</subject><title>Associations between neutrophil potential phagocytic capacity in proven bulls and traits of economic importance in their daughters</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8g84mp392.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2n49t4132</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Animal Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:m900nw65q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:08:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Eukaryotic proteins with a carboxyl-terminal CXXX motif are modified by isoprenylation and subsequently processed by proteolysis of the three terminal amino acids and carboxylmethylation of the exposed cysteine residue. The myelination-associated 2$ sp prime$,3$ sp prime$-cyclic nucleotide 3$ sp prime$-phosphodiesterase (CNP) has a C-terminal CTII sequence and is isoprenylated; however, no examples of subsequent processing exist when a polar threonine is located adjacent to the cysteine. Here I show that CNP is capable of being carboxylmethylated in both insect cells and glioma cells. This processing is dependent upon isoprenylation of the cysteine and can be inhibited with the isoprenylated cysteine derivative, N-acetyl-S-farnesyl-L-cysteine. Carboxylmethylation results in an enhancement of hydrophobicity and membrane association. Although the role of the methyl group at the C-terminus of other isoprenylated proteins isn't fully understood, modulation of signal transduction pathways is strongly indicated. This modification of CNP may similarly regulate cell biological processes in myelinogenesis.</description><creator>Cox, Martha E. (Martha Ellen)</creator><contributor>Braun, Peter E.

We introduce a text data type, and implement relational algebra operations on the text data type. Our method stores the text data in text files external to the relations, and maintains pointers to the text data within the relations. Our algorithms minimize accesses to the actual text data so as to maintain the efficiency of database operations. We also implement a text processing mechanism where a text script can be joined to a relation, producing an individualized text script for each tuple in the relation. Our implementation includes queries involving pattern searches within text attribute values. All operations on text data are relational algebra operations, requiring the text data to be in relations, and returning relations as results.</description><creator>Chiama, Jared Alungo</creator><contributor>Merrett, T.

(2) using changes in hemolytic activity to indirectly examine interactions of plant extracts with cholesterol, cholesterol-analogues, conjugated bile salts and non-conjugated bile salts. (3) using radiolabelled cholesterol to examine direct binding capacity of extracts with cholesterol. Albizia anthelmintica, Myrsine africana and Acacia goetzii were most likely to contain saponins and had significant (p $&lt;$ 0.05) hemolytic activity that was effected by the presence of cholesterol, cholesterol analogues, conjugated and non-conjugated bile salts (p $&lt;$ 0.05). Methanol, ethyl acetate, aqueous and n-butanol extracts of A. anthelmintica and methanol, ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts of A. goetzii bound significant amounts of cholesterol solubilized in ethanol (p $&lt;$ 0.05). Thus, saponins are a detectable component of the Batemi diet and extracts likely containing saponins do interact with chemicals that have been proposed to be involved in in vivo mechanisms of saponin induced hypocholesterolemia. A. anthelmintica and A. goetzii seem likely to have hypocholesterolemic potential as dietary additives.</description><creator>Chapman, Laurie</creator><contributor>Johns, Timonty (advisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Saponins.</subject><subject>Anticholesteremic agents.</subject><subject>Hypocholesteremia.</subject><subject>Masai (African people) -- Nutrition.</subject><title>In vitro hypocholesterolemic potential of dietary additives used by the Batemi and Maasai people : (Hypocholesterolemic potential of additives from a traditional diet)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bv73c266m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9306t128c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:05741t895</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:08:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Family members have been observed to cope with the losses inherent in terminal illness by grieving. Little is known, however, about the factors which influence their grieving before the death of a significant other. This paper describes an exploratory, cross-sectional, correlational study designed to examine the relationships among general coping style, hope, and anticipatory grief in a convenience sample of 61 family members of individuals with terminal cancer. The organizing framework for this study was based on grief theory, Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) theory of stress and coping, and Davies, Reimer, and Martens' (1990) transition framework. Data were collected by a four-part questionnaire comprising the Jalowiec Coping Scale (Jalowiec, 1987), the Herth Hope Index (Herth, 1991), the Non-Death Version of the Grief Experience Inventory (Sanders, Mauger, &amp; Strong, 1985), and a background information sheet developed by the researcher. Findings revealed that family members experienced individual anticipatory grief patterns. Women experienced more despair and anger/hostility than men. Adult children, more highly educated family members, individuals not living with the ill person, and non-primary caregivers expressed more anger/hostility. Multiple regression results showed that emotive coping and hope accounted for significant proportions of the variance in despair, somatization, and loss of control. Emotive coping contributed significant variation in anger/hostility, whereas lack of hope accounted for a significant amount of the variation in social isolation. Neither the general coping styles nor hope significantly predicted death anxiety. Suggestions for research and nursing were indicated.</description><creator>Chapman, Kimberly J.

The latter are known to be involved in neurotransmission. However, the physiological significance of the $ alpha$-toxin sensitive population is unclear, although an involvement in trophic functions has been suggested. The present studies were carried out to investigate the possible involvement of the nicotinic $ alpha$-BGT receptor in growth related activity in neuronal PC12 cells and in H69 cells, a small cell lung carcinoma cell line. In PC12 cells, nicotine treatment resulted in a decline in neuritic outgrowth which could be prevented by treatment with $ alpha$-BGT or d-tubocurarine, a nicotinic antagonist, at concentrations which correlated very well with those required to inhibit ($ sp{125}$I ($ alpha$-BGT binding in PC12 cells. $ alpha$-BGT had no effect on ($ sp3$H) noradrenaline release, a function known to be mediated through the $ alpha$-toxin insensitive population of nicotinic receptors suggesting that $ alpha$-BGT interacts specifically with the $ alpha$-toxin sensitive population of nicotinic receptors to mediate its effects on neuritic outgrowth in PC12 cells. In H69 cells, exposure to nicotine or the nicotinic agonist, cytisine, resulted in an increase in cell number which could be blocked by $ alpha$-BGT as well as by d-tubocurarine, suggesting the involvement of an $ alpha$-BGT sensitive nicotinic receptor in mediating the observed effects on H69 cell number. Taken together, these two lines of studies using both a neuronal as well as a non-neuronal cell line suggest that nicotinic $ alpha$-BGT receptors may be involved in a growth related role namely that of regulating neuritic outgrowth in PC12 cells and cell proliferation in H69 cells.

An event-sampling design was used to overcome methodological limitations of past research in the area. Contrary to much previous research, neuroticism was not related to reports of physical symptoms, although it was related to unpleasant affect. Unpleasant affect bore a strong concurrent relation to the frequency of reported symptoms. Temporal relations between experiences of unpleasant affect and subsequent symptoms were found for some individuals, but wide individual variability was seen in both the strength and direction of this linkage. The findings suggest that when individuals are asked to report their subjective experiences of physical illness without the necessity to retrospect over significant periods of time, unpleasant affect is more strongly related to experience of symptoms than is neuroticism.</description><creator>Brown, Kirk Warren</creator><contributor>Moskowitz, D.

Persistence can be improved by the use of cultivars with good disease resistance and by applying phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). The objective of this study was to examine the productivity and quality of alfalfa cultivars differing in disease resistance, under various fertilizer regimes on three different soils. A completely cross-classified factorial experiment in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) was established in 1990 with three rates of P (0, 33, and 66 kg ha$ sp{-1}$), three rates of K (0, 124, and 248 kg ha$ sp{-1}$), and two cultivars ("Apica" and "Oneida VR"). Treatment combinations were established (with 10% timothy, by seed weight) on three soils with distinctive drainage characteristics (referred to as ideal, intermediate and marginal). Disease ratings, stand counts, yields and herbage mineral content were measured in each of two production years. Yields and plant populations were the lowest on the marginal soil, while disease levels were the highest. Fusarium spp. were the most common fungal isolates from diseased roots and crowns at all sites. Apica tended to persist better than Oneida VR and have lower levels of crown and root rot. Neither P nor K had an effect on yield or persistence at the Ideal site, with positive responses noted on yield at the other sites. Potassium improved persistence at the Intermediate site and had variable but positive effects on disease levels. Increased rates of K fertilizer resulted in reduced herbage Ca, Mg, crude protein (CP) and increased herbage K and Acid Detergent Fibre (ADF) levels. Regardless of management, alfalfa production on soils with inadequate drainage remains risky.</description><creator>Bosveld, Eric</creator><date>1994</date><subject>Timothy-grass.</subject><subject>Alfalfa.</subject><title>Management of an alfalfatimothy mixture for yield, quality and persistence on soils differing in internal drainage</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9880vt02h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g158bk258</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Plant Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3j333442s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:08:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Least squares linear regression is a common tool in ecological research. One of the central assumptions of least squares linear regression is that the independent variable is measured without error. But this variable is measured with error whenever it is a sample mean. The significance of such contraventions is not regularly assessed in ecological studies. A simulation program was made to provide such an assessment. The program requires a hypothetical data set, and using estimates of S$ sp2$ it scatters the hypothetical data to simulate the effect of sampling error. A regression line is drawn through the scattered data, and SSE and r$ sp2$ are measured. This is repeated numerous times (e.g. 1000) to generate probability distributions for r$ sp2$ and SSE. From these distributions it is possible to assess the likelihood of the hypothetical data resulting in a given SSE or r$ sp2$. The method was applied to survey data used in a published TP-CHLa regression (Pace 1984). Beginning with a hypothetical, linear data set (r$ sp2$ = 1), simulated scatter due to sampling exceeded the SSE from the regression through the survey data about 30% of the time. Thus chances are 3 out of 10 that the level of uncertainty found in the surveyed TP-CHLa relationship would be observed if the true relationship were perfectly linear. If this is so, more precise and more comprehensive models will only be possible when better estimates of the means are available. This simulation approach should apply to all least squares regression studies that use sampled means, and should be especially relevant to studies that use log-transformed values.</description><creator>Beedell, David C.

The Spitzer Quality-of-Life Index (QL-Index) has proven to be valid and reliable in various clinical studies. However, it has shown a lack of responsiveness when used with low back pain patients. In an attempt to improve responsiveness, a disease specific module was developed to complement the QL-Index. Patients, their significant others, and health professionals were interviewed to determine the contents of the LBP-Module, A prospective design was employed in the preliminary psychometric study (n = 31). This study demonstrated good internal consistency ($ alpha$ = 0.818) and high test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.91) for the combined use of the QL-Index and LBP-Module. It also showed strong evidence supporting construct validity. Effect size (ES = 1.42) and standardized response mean (SRM = 1.24) calculations demonstrated high responsiveness for the combined use of the quality-of-life measures. The LBP-Module presented in this thesis seems to be the first quality-of-life measure developed for persons with this disorder. It should therefore be a useful outcome measure in future studies.</description><creator>Beaulieu, Sylvie</creator><contributor>Wood-Dauphinee, Sharon (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</subject><title>Development of a quality-of-life measure for persons with low back pain</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vd66w1854.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/707959768</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Physical and Occupational Therapy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9p290c62d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:08:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The objective was to analyze the effects of logging and prescribed burning on carabid beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) at a jack pine stand and white spruce plantations in order to assess short-term impacts of these forestry practices on the diversity of this beetle group. In addition, soil scarification was also included at the jack pine stand. Based on previous reports on forest disturbance influences on carabids, it is hypothesized that short-term effects of studied forestry practices do not reduce carabids' diversity. Four carabid assemblage characteristics were compared: (a) number of catches; (b) dry mass; (c) species richness; and, (d) diversity index. Species responses and dry mass distributions were also investigated. Treatments either increased or maintained studied variables compared with control sites. Diversity indices were highest in burnt-over areas. Similar response patterns of species or groups of species were observed in both forest types. The presence of regenerating sites among the natural landscape increased carabid diversity.</description><creator>Beaudry, Suzanne</creator><contributor>Cote, Benoit (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Ground beetles -- Ecology</subject><subject>Prescribed burning -- Environmental aspects</subject><subject>Biodiversity.</subject><subject>Logging -- Environmental aspects.</subject><title>Effects of forest site preparation methods on carabid beetle (Coleoptera:Carabidae) diversity</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8c97ks53n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9p290c62d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kp78gj528</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:08:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A randomized clinical trial was undertaken to compare the effectiveness and direct costs of shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) for the treatment of symptomatic gallbladder stones. Over a period of 24 months from a total of 468 patients screened, 35 patients were randomized to ESWL, and 25 to LC. 32 ESWL patients were treated, all as out-patients, with a mean convalescence post-ESWL of 0.5 $ pm$ 1.2 days. In contrast, all LC patients were admitted to hospital for a mean duration of 2.8 $ pm$ 1.5 days with a mean post-operative convalescence of 18.2 $ pm$ 16.8 days as measured by research nurses. The two patient groups did not differ with respect to McGill Pain scores administered immediately after treatment. Three Quality of Life (QOL) tools improved similarly in both groups within the month following treatment. The only differences in QOL questionnaire results between both groups when administered 3 months following treatment and at six monthly intervals thereafter occurred for LC as greater incremental improvements were noted at 6 and 12 months follow-up. The overall stone disappearance rate in the ESWL group after a median of 15 months was 38%. Direct costs to the Quebec Health Care system during the study period were determined by analysis of patients in both treatment groups. In 1993 canadian dollars, average costs and their range were 2,889$ (1,704 $-5,830$) for patients undergoing LC, and 3,936 $ (2,367$--6,243 $) for patients treated by ESWL. The cost effectiveness ratios using the incremental differences in direct costs and duration of disability favoured ESWL at a cost of 58.9$/day of disability saved over the 15--18 months follow-up period.

The first type of activity is a positive-going interictal-like potential that corresponds to a burst of population spikes, and is abolished by non-NMDA receptor antagonists; the second type of field potential is a low frequency, negative going synchronous event which is sensitive to GABA$ rm sb{A}$ receptor antagonism. Knowing that in the hippocampus, adenosine A1 receptors are located presynaptically, on the terminals of excitatory neurons, and that their activation prevents glutamate release, I have used a specific adenosine A1 receptor agonist and altered the occurrence of the interictal-like potential. It is also established that $ mu$ opioid receptors in the hippocampus are located presynaptically on GABAergic interneurons where their activation prevents release of GABA. Therefore, I have used a specific $ mu$ opioid receptor agonist and altered the occurrence of the negative-going field potential. In summary, the experiments reported in this thesis demonstrate that 4AP-induced activity is generated through a presynaptic mechanism at both excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) terminals. The relevance of this work is two fold: (i) it helps to better understand the mechanisms of 4AP-induced epileptogenesis and (ii) it highlights the putative role of adenosine as an antiepileptic drug.</description><creator>Barbarosie, Michaela T.

This management information is stored in an object-oriented Management Information Base (MIB) that can be accessed by Common Management Information Service (CMIS) management applications. An approach for polling based on a variable polling frequency is proposed. A stateful model for a simple version CMIP proxy agent for SNMP which requires management information collected from SNMP agents to be stored in the proxy agent's MIB is also proposed. The proxy agent is implemented using the so-called OSIMIS-3.0 software package which implements CMIP, and an existing SNMP application. A policy of variable polling frequency which is based on the cost of polling, the cost of loss of relevant management information and the frequency of update of new information is used by the proxy agent. The agent is tested on a distributed network consisting of a LAN at McGill University and another LAN at the University of Montreal. The results from the test show that using the above model of a proxy agent between CMIP and SNMP yields a better response time as compared to the stateless proxy agent model used by the Network Management Forum (NMF93), as well as an up-to-date information about the network to a CMIS manager during critical situations.</description><creator>Agbaw, Catherine E.
