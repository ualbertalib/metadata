One is the inspiration-synchronous burst, the other is a previously unknown late-expiratory burst. The properties of the inspiration-synchronous burst and its temporal relation to the phrenic nerve burst were studied under conditions in which the frequency of the latter was changed over a wide range by superior laryngeal nerve stimulation, by changes in ventilation frequency while the phrenic nerve burst was locked to the pump, and by hypocapnic hyperthermia. The data obtained are consistent with the hypothesis of a common rhythmic driver for phrenic motoneurons and sympathetic preganglionic neurons. Stimulation of low-threshold afferents in the superior laryngeal nerve selectively suppressed the phrenic burst together with the inspiration-synchronous sympathetic discharge and produced vasodilatation. The contribution of the inspiration-synchronous sympathetic discharge to neurogenic vasoconstriction was estimated, in the hindlimb of the cat, from the magnitude of the vasodilatation. A late-expiratory burst of sympathetic discharge was produced by systemic hypercapnia and by raising end-expiratory pressure to between 2 and 7 cmH$ sb2$O. Circumstantial evidence suggests this late-expiratory burst is due to input from late-expiratory neurons to sympathetic preganglionic neurons. As a background to the experimental data a survey is presented of present knowledge of the mechanisms providing mechanical and neural coupling between respiration and circulation. The functional significance of respiratory modulation of sympathetic activity is discussed.</description><creator>Bachoo, Manjit</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><title>Central mechanisms responsible for generating respiratory-modulated sympathetic nerve discharge</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/41687j13h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g732d9684</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qn59q468w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis concerns the possible existence of central nervous system (CNS) chemosensitive mechanisms influencing sympathetic activity. The thesis is based on observations of sympathetic neuron and cardiovascular responses to CNS ischemia, systemic hypoxia and systemic hypercapnia. Investigation of the pressor response to cerebral ischemia in the cat indicates that it is mediated by superficial regions of the ventral medulla also involved in the pressor response to central hypercapnia. Experiments concerning the sympathetic response to systemic hypoxia in the CNS-intact sino-aortic denervated cat revealed a two-component response of the firing rates of single sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPN), the mass activity of the cervical sympathetic trunk, and the neurogenic component of hindlink vascular resistance (N-HLVR). The response consisted of: (i) an increase of all three variables during extreme hypoxia, and (ii) a decrease during moderate hypoxia. The hypoxic sympatho-depression resulted from loss of central respiratory input to SPNs as well as of respiration-independent input. The hypoxic sympatho-excitation involved only the latter input. Investigation of the sympathetic response to systemic hypercapnia in the acute C$ sb1$ spinal cat demonstrated a direct relationship between SPN firing rate or N-HLVR and arterial PCO$ sb2$ between normocapnia and severe hypercapnia. N-HLVR also increased in this preparation during systemic hypoxia.</description><creator>Rohlicek, Charles Vaclav.</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><title>Properties of sympathetic neuron responses to cerebral ischemia and to systemic hypoxia or hypercapnia which suggest mediation by central chemosensitive mechanisms</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b2773w33m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qn59q468w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physiology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1c18dg352</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation addresses the issue of cost subadditivity of two Canadian telecommunications carriers, Bell Canada and Alberta Government Telephones (AGT). Multi-output, multi-input models of the production structure of Bell Canada and AGT are estimated under various alternative hypotheses. Subadditivity tests are conducted for both these companies in order to increase understanding of the issues concerning the deregulation of the Canadian telecommunications network and to assist policy makers in their decisions. The hypothesis that both Bell Canada and AGT are natural monopolies cannot be rejected. Important cost savings are realized from having each of these firms alone in their respective markets producing the total of toll and local calls. Allowing competition in AGT's market would increase costs by approximately 20%, while costs in Bell Canada's market would increase by twice as much. It is found that Bell Canada's cost savings, though still quite important, are significantly reduced after 1983. Apparently, the high adjustment costs that Bell Canada incurs in installing new capital equipment, its organizational restructuring that followed the liberalization of customer premises equipment in 1982 as well as the recent technological changes may explain this turn-about in Bell Canada's cost structure. We conclude that the 1985 Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission's (CRTC) decision not to deregulate Bell Canada's long distance public voice monopoly market (MTS and WATS) was socially optimal.</description><creator>Gentzoglanis, Anastassios, 1956-</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Alberta Government Telephones.</subject><subject>Telecommunication -- Canada -- Costs</subject><subject>Telephone -- Canada -- Costs</subject><subject>Bell Canada.</subject><title>Cost structure characteristics of the Canadian telecommunications carriers : some empirical evidence from Bell Canada and Alberta Government Telephones (AGT)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r781wg63v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1c18dg352</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Economics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ff365576q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Transcription in mammalian and yeast mitochondria proceeds from a few well defined promoters, with processing of polycistronic transcripts producing the mature RNAs. The levels of different sequences in the steady-state RNA populations depend on differential promoter strengths, transcription attenuation and/or selective termination, and differential RNA stabilities. To gain insights into the processes governing transcription and RNA levels in plant mitochondria, a system using isolated maize mitochondria, which synthesize bona fide mitochondrial RNAs, was developed and partially characterized with respect to exogenous requirements and sensitivity to inhibitors of DNA-dependent RNA synthesis. Although initiation and processing probably occur at reduced levels in isolated maize mitochondria, endogenous DNA templates are extensively transcribed at the same relative rates as in vivo. Isolated maize mitochondria were used to demonstrate that differential rates of both synthesis and turnover help determine the steady-state abundances of various mitochondrial RNA sequences and that mitochondria from certain lines possess an autonomously-replicating, RNA-based genetic system.</description><creator>Finnegan, Patrick Michael</creator><date>1989</date><subject>RNA -- Synthesis.</subject><subject>Corn -- Cytogenetics.</subject><title>RNA synthesis in maize mitochondria : the identification of autonomously replicating RNA species and a kinetic analysis of transcript accumulation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2v23vv058.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ff365576q</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:08612p30h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is a major complication of bone marrow transplantation and may also occur naturally through the transplacental passage of maternal lymphocytes to the fetus. GVHD is associated with a broad spectrum of immunological disorders as well as distinct pathological changes. Yet, the exact nature of the effector cells involved remains to be elucidated. Studies on natural killer cell activity in bone marrow transplant patients have led to the speculation that natural killer cells may be major effectors of GVHD-induced immunopathogenesis. To determine the role played by natural killer cells in GVHD, a murine model of neonatal GVHD was established. Natural killer cell function was evaluated in lymphoid target organs at various times post induction and was found to be significantly augmented by seven days post-injection. The phenotype of the effector cell was determined by antibody depletion studies to be asialo GM1 positive, partially Thy-1 positive and glass wool non-adherent. Immunostaining indicated an increased frequency of asialo GM-1 positive cells in the spleens of GVHD-induced mice. These effectors were further determined to be predominantly of donor origin. The in vivo role of these asialo GM-1 positive cells in the actual pathogenesis of GVHD was also investigated. Asialo GM1 positive cells were depleted from either the donor inoculum prior to injection or from the recipient in vivo post-injection. Only the depletion of asialo GM1 positive cells from the host in vivo was effective in reducing GVHD-associated morbidity. The possible role of placental suppressive factors in the protection of the fetus was also examined using this model. Extracts derived from placental tissue were found to be sufficiently potent to suppress in vivo the development of acute GVHD. Our findings indicate that donor-derived asialo GM-1 positive killer cells play a major role in the development of acute GVHD. In addition, factors associated with the placenta may provide a sufficient functional barrier to prevent the development of GVHD in the fetus as the result of the transplacental passage of maternal lymphocytes.</description><creator>McGuinness, Ursula M.</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><title>Analysis of the function, phenotype and modulation of natural effector cells during neonatal graft versus host disease</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q237hs58w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/08612p30h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rb68xc488</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Ventilation by high-frequency body-surface oscillation (HFBSO) was studied in normal rabbits. Adequate ventilation and acceptable gas exchange took place during HFBSO from 3 to 15 Hz. The tidal volume required to maintain a normocapnic state was established at each frequency studied. Using catheter-tip micromanometers inserted in the esophagus or the superior vena cava, new techniques to measure high-frequency intrathoracic pressure oscillations were developed. Using a gamma-function to fit the thermodilution curve, a new technique was developed to measure the cardiac output in small animals. No detrimental hemodynamic effect was found during HFBSO used either for normocapnic ventilation or with large pressure oscillations (30 cm H$ sb{ rm 2}$O) in the body chamber. Finally, during normocapnic ventilation by HFBSO in normal rabbits, the mechanical behavior of the respiratory system was characterized using transfer impedances.</description><creator>Chartrand, Daniel, 1955-</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><title>Ventilation by high-frequency body-surface oscillation in rabbits</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6682x4669.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rb68xc488</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:c534fp62z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study considers a number of problems which remain in nonlinear consolidation modelling and prediction, despite the considerable research effort which has already been devoted to the subject. Nonlinear consolidation models refer to those models capable of accounting for material nonlinearity either explicitly, in the formulation of the governing equation, or implicitly in the numerical-solution technique. A nonlinear model can be characterised by its generality, appropriateness for modelling consolidation and prediction-capability. These three characteristics are not consistent; a model's superiority with respect to one characteristic does not imply its overall superiority. This inconsistency between the characteristics is resolved by a proposed model. This model is seen as an improvement over two available and widely used models; the Gibson et al. (1967) and Yong et al. (1983) models. Nonlinear multiple-layer analysis requires the satisfaction of continuity conditions at the inter-layer boundaries. Existing continuity procedures seek to reduce the problem to a tractable single-layer problem, ignore the interaction between layers and are unsuitable for use with nonlinear models. Procedures, based on the trial-function technique, are proposed which satisfy the continuity conditions and facilitate these analyses. Various procedures are necessary to define the initial consolidation status of a soil depending on whether the field data is complete or incomplete. Procedures which can acknowledge incomplete data by calling for bounded analyses and yet can take full advantage of available data are proposed. A finite-difference numerical-solution algorithm is developed for use with the proposed non-linear model. This algorithm is efficient, versatile and more suitable for multiple-layer analysis than the Yong et al. (1983) algorithm, on which it is based. The findings of this study are successfully field validated on the basis of three case histories; the consolidation of highly compressible organic soils underlying two embankments in Poland and subsidence due to groundwater withdrawal in Bangkok, Thailand.</description><creator>Sellappah, Jeevan</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Applied Mechanics.</subject><title>Some considerations on nonlinear consolidation modelling and prediction</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6q182k84r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fp62z</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rf55z849s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study explores and describes the processes of formative evaluation as carried out by content experts and instructional designers. It assumes that formative evaluation is an ill-defined, complex, problem solving task. Six experts (three Content Experts and three Instructional Designers), participated in this descriptive study. Subjects reviewed and revised a unit from a draft version of a self-instructional module on microbiology, while thinking aloud. Two coding schemes were developed and applied to the think-aloud protocols. Overall inter-coder reliability exceeded 89%. Qualitative data were used to describe the processes of formative evaluation, convergence patterns, and the degree of specificity of comments across subjects. Results suggest that there were between group differences in task representation, in the employed strategies, and in features of the text which were commented upon more frequently. Within group similarities in the outcome of formative evaluation were salient on a superficial level.

Bilateral measurements were taken for selected variables of the talocalcaneal flexibility by means of a mechanical goniometer, and of the peak isokinetic knee strength on a Cybex II device. The frontal and horizontal plane motions of the lower limbs of the subjects were recorded by high speed filming and videotaping while they were running on a motor driven treadmill at their training pace under two conditions: with running shoes and barefoot. A detailed description of each runner's history was obtained and bilateral dominance characteristics were determined. Significant functional asymmetries were found for subtalar joint flexibility (eversion, inversion, and eversion/inversion ratio) and peak isokinetic knee strength (flexion, extension, total, and flexion/extension ratio). Significant kinematic asymmetries were revealed during the foot support phase in lower leg angle, rearfoot angle, mediolateral velocity of the foot, and in some temporal parameters. The two running conditions differed significantly only for the pretouchdown phase of support. Significant trends of association were identified between selected components of the lower limb functional and kinematical asymmetries which were characterized by consistent laterality patterns. Multivariate asymmetry components and running injury patterns were independent. Only asymmetries in foot pronation during barefoot running tended to significantly differentiate between runners grouped by injury incidence.

Loss of cholinergic innervation to forebrain and brainstem structures was also assessed by histochemistry. Histological and histochemical analysis of the brains after the lesion showed a major destruction of the pontomesencephalic cholinergic neurons and a major loss of innervation to thalamic nuclei and brainstem regions, including the reticular formation. Whereas the states of waking and slow wave sleep were relatively unaffected, paradoxical sleep (PS) was reduced or eliminated immediately following the lesions. Two to three weeks later, incipient PS-like episodes returned with a reduced PGO spike rate and REMs, and an elevated EMG amplitude, marking the loss of muscle atonia. Such results suggest pontomesencephalic cholinergic neurons and their projections to thalamic and brainstem regions are important for the expression of PS and its defining variables.</description><creator>Webster, Harry, 1947-</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Acetylcholine -- Receptors.</subject><subject>Sleep -- Stages.</subject><subject>Sleep-wake cycle.</subject><title>The role of cholinergic neurons of the dorsolateral pontomesencephalic tegmentum in sleep-wakefulness states /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1j92g822f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t435gd60f</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h128nf44x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this dissertation it is contended that central to Reinhold Niebuhr's theology and ethics is his understanding of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ as a revelation of the suffering of God. Keeping in mind the theologia crucis of Martin Luther, Part I examines the significance of the Christian symbol of the cross during Niebuhr's formative years and as he later sought to relate the moral and ethical insights of the Christian faith to the more tragic social and political events of his age. Part II begins with a systematic appraisal of Niebuhr's theology of the cross in reference to his understanding of Christian anthropology, theology proper, the atonement, history and eschatology. The theological similarities of Niebuhr's thought to the theologia crucis of Luther are made explicit. A delineation is then made of Niebuhr's social ethic of the cross. It is an ethic which seeks to underscore the true but limited relevance of the norm of sacrificial love to issues of relative justice. This ethic is then contrasted to the ethica crucis of Luther. The dissertation concludes with an examination of the current debate regarding Niebuhr's ultimate political position. It is suggested that an understanding of Niebuhr's theology and ethic of the cross is essential to any thorough appreciation of the major shifts which occurred within his political thought.</description><creator>Nordberg, Thomas G.</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Niebuhr, Reinhold, 1892-1971 -- Political and social views</subject><subject>Jesus Christ -- Crucifixion</subject><title>The centrality of the cross in Reinhold Niebuhr's Christian theology and ethics /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/td96k327c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h128nf44x</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Religious Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nk322f04j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The formalism of effective potential method is first studied for usual field theory and extended to supersymmetric field theory. The specific case of supersymmetric quantum electrodynamics is then introduced. The superfields are shifted as required by Weinberg's method for the evaluation of effective potentials and superpropagators are derived with the method developed by Helayel-Neto for cases where supersymmetry is explicitly broken. Then, the one and two loop corrections to the effective potential may be calculated. These corrections are seen to be complex everywhere but at the minimum of the potential. Tile theory is then renormalized in a modified minimal substraction scheme and a finite expression is finally obtained for the effective potential. Thereon, the renormalized coupling constant and the $ beta$-function are calculated.</description><creator>Nadeau, Raymond.</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Physics, Elementary Particles and High Energy.</subject><title>Two-loop effective potential of supersymmetric quantum electrodynamics</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r494vk698.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nk322f04j</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1831ck640</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis analyzes and tests some new solution techniques for the optimal power flow problem. This new methodology exploits a parametric technique, called the continuation method, which is applied to different tasks in the solution procedure. In a first application, the continuation method solves the quadratic subproblems generated sequentially by the optimal power flow's nonlinear program. It first creates a simple subproblem, which is easy to solve, and then links it to the subproblem we wish to solve. Starting at the solution of the simple problem, it generates optimal solution trajectories for the intermediate problems, leading to the desired optimal solution. In a second application, the algorithm tracks optimal solutions trajectories of the nonlinear problem when the load is slowly varied. This constitutes an example of "incremental loading", a technique already used for real power dispatch, but in this case a complete network model is used. The flexibility of the algorithm at various levels allows for some excellent computation times in this load-tracking mode: we have observed reductions in computation times for new solutions of the order of 70%, compared to the computation time of the initial load. This thesis first presents an analysis of the various structures used in optimal power flow algorithms. Then, having chosen and presented the structure of our algorithm, we analyze the quadratic subproblems generated by this algorithm for some of its more important tasks: minimum cost, minimum losses and load shedding. New rules are proposed to link the solutions of successive subproblems to ensure the convergence of the nonlinear problem. Then, as a final contribution to the theory, some extensions are suggested for the subproblems: among them are ramp constraints, bus incremental costs, and provisions for redispatching. Numerical simulations of the proposed optimal power flow algorithm using the minimum fuel cost task were performed on four test systems, with sizes ranging from 6 to 118 buses. The results are documented in detail, and results for the 30 bus test are compared to those reported by other authors. All in all, our results demonstrate quite well the potential of this technique.

Performance was measured in terms of: accuracy scores, haptic exploration scores, and exploration times. Higher scores were obtained on the intra-modal visual condition than on any of the conditions involving a haptic component. Increasing the exploration times for haptic stimuli did not significantly improve performance on tasks involving a haptic component. Performance scores of poor readers were depressed on all tasks, suggesting a general deficit in sensory processing rather than an inter-sensory processing deficit. Poor readers further employed less sophisticated haptic exploration strategies than able readers, suggesting use of less efficient task strategies.</description><creator>Le Gallais, Judy</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Visual perception -- Testing -- Case studies</subject><subject>Reading -- Research</subject><subject>Reading disability -- Research</subject><title>Performance of able and disabled readers on tasks of intra- and inter-modal haptic and visual processing</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m613mz20x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q237hs595</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5999n4045</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Aspects of stability of access tunnels with particular reference to the factors controlling face access tunnel closure upon the efficiency of coal production and safety of longwall mining operations are investigated. These are used to justify the present studies of tunnel stability and barrier pillar design in mines of the Cape Breton Coalfield. An analysis of in situ deformation data of 26 face access tunnels by tunnel convergence measurement and a new photographic technique for approximately 40 km of tunnels are presented. Comparative studies of these techniques are made and deformation characteristics with respect to depth of cover, panel width, extracted seam height, barrier pillar width, type of steel arch supports and the effect of adjacent workings are investigated. Due to the narrow range of field data, the effect of such parameters as extracted seam height, panel width, tunnel shape and tunnel size could not be examined, nor could the influence which the material properties may have on tunnel closure be identified. Hence, comprehensive parametric studies by two dimensional finite element simulation of the face access tunnels by use of MSAP2D are undertaken. Stress and displacement distributions and the extent of any failed zone around the tunnel with respect to the aforementioned parameters together with barrier pillar width, and the stiffness of the surrounding materials are considered. The existing theories for tunnel convergence prediction are described. From this investigation it is found that some of these theories are inapplicable to soft rocks at depth. Those which are applicable, due to their limitations, are not suited for prediction of the vertical convergence profile from tunnel faceline in longwall coal mining. Hence, a new theoretical exponential formula for tunnel convergence prediction based on a modified Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion is developed and checked against in situ convergence measurements. The current barrier pillar design criteria are also investigated. It is found that these criteria yield too conservative a design and are not suited for depths greater than 600 m below ground surface. Hence, two theoretical methods of designing barrier pillar width for longwall coal mining are developed and compared with field data and current barrier pillar design criteria.</description><creator>Majdi, Abbas</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Engineering, Mining.</subject><title>A study of tunnel stability and barrier pillar design in mines of the Cape Breton coalfield.</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8w32r6337.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5999n4045</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fx719n094</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Joseph Breitbach began publishing literature in the late twenties. He came to occupy a specific place in the literary period generally called New Objectivity. The goal of this thesis is to define that place more closely. The first chapter analyzes Breitbach's early stories, whose themes are based on the new social reality of his time. The focus is on the organized workers of the far left (the proletarians), as well as the growing class of small clerks known as the petite bourgeoisie. Breitbach, a department store manager, crafted his fictional characters from this milieu and portrayed both their social problems and everyday life from his observations. The second chapter illustrates a decisive change in Breitbach's emphasis. In the novel Die Wandlung der Susanne Dasseldorf, which unfolds during the Allied occupation following the First World War, he juxtaposes the two fundamental classes, proletariat and bourgeoisie. Breitbach maintains a place among the writers of the New Objectivity for his retrospective of the postwar period as well as his contemporary portrayal of the lower classes. The thesis also discusses Breitbach's progressive thinking in his treatment of the female character in his novel and the now almost forgotten German-American relations in the occupied region of Coblenz.</description><creator>Doerr, Karin</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Breitbach, Joseph, 1903- -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><title>Joseph Breitbachs frühe Prosa im Licht der neuen Sachlichkeit</title><language>ger</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g445cd90d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fx719n094</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of German</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:44558d98v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The radiation heat transfer from an argon and a nitrogen transferred-arc column to a cylindrical enclosure was measured. The rate of heat transfer was successfully correlated in a non-dimensional manner, with respect to the arc length within the enclosure and the enclosure diameter for the section of the arc column located within the enclosure, and with respect to the arc length outside the enclosure and the enclosure diameter for the section of the arc column outside the enclosure. It was discovered that tangential injection of a particulate feed material into the cylindrical enclosure led to the formation of destabilizing lump-like deposits on the roof and wall of the enclosure. Feeding vertically through the roof of the enclosure in the presence of a vortex resulted in the formation of a uniform film deposit and stable operation. Under these conditions, up to 49% of the incident radiant energy emanating from the arc column to the sleeve surface was absorbed by the feed. The carbothermic reduction of a fine (3-10$ mu$m) V$ sb2$O$ sb5$ powder in the plasma furnace resulted in the production of a commercial ferrovanadium alloy of controllable vanadium content. Particulate losses to the exhaust gases were very low, in the order of 2%. Specific energy consumption was 17kWh/kg of vanadium produced. Based on the results of these tests, specific energy consumption at a larger scale would be reduced by at least 50%.</description><creator>Parisi, Paul Joseph.</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Metallurgical furnaces -- Models</subject><subject>Heat -- Transmission</subject><subject>Plasma jets</subject><title>Heat transfer and particulate feeding to a cylindrical enclosure in the presence of a plasma transferred-arc</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1n79h509d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/44558d98v</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wh246s748</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Six experiments tested the assumption that, in visual perception, observers have reliable and direct access to the equivalence of shapes in projective geometry (I call this "the invariance hypothesis in the theory of shape constancy"). This assumption has been made in the study of vision since Helmholtz's time. Two experiments tested recognition of the projective equivalence of planar shapes. In another four experiments, subjects estimated the apparent shape of a solid object from different perspectives. Departure from projective equivalence was assessed in each study by measuring the cross ratio for the plane. This measure of projective invariance is new to perceptual research. Projective equivalence was not found to be perceived uniformly in any of the studies. A significant effect of change in perspective was found in each study. These results were construed as supporting the classical theory of depth cues against the invariance hypothesis.</description><creator>Niall, Keith</creator><date>1987</date><subject>Visual perception.</subject><subject>Geometry, Projective.</subject><title>Projective invariance and visual perception</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fb494915z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wh246s748</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:41687j152</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The effect of silica on the crystallization and melting behavior of a highly isotactic, well characterized isotactic polystyrene (i-PS) have been investigated. The origins of the various endotherms obtained upon heating have been defined by partial scanning experiments and by a study of the effect of heating rate using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The presence of 1 part silica in 100 parts polymer (1 pph) decreases the maximum degree of crystallinity considerably but has a minimal effect on the rate of crystallization. Analysis by the Avrami method shows that the silica does not affect the overall rate of crystallization significantly. The decrease in the crystallinity indicates that silica affects the level of secondary crystallization, thus the crystal perfection. The surface morphologies and growth rates of i-PS spherulites, as studied by photomicroscopy, were not affected by 1 pph of silica. The experimental data were fitted to a modified form of the Hoffman-Lauritzen equation. The effect of silica on spherulite growth rates and surface morphologies of isotactic poly(propylene oxide) (i-PPO) have also been investigated by optical microscopy. Two distinct i-PPO samples of different molecular weights were used, each of which was highly isotactic. The addition of silica has a pronounced effect on the morphology of the spherulites, producing dendritic type morphology. Upon step-crystallization, the spherulites exhibited mixed morphologies, i.e., fibrillar and ringed. Silica depresses the spherulite growth rates throughout the entire temperature range. The effects were more profound as the quantity of filler increased. The growth rate-temperature behavior was analysed in terms of the classical Hoffman-Lauritzen equation and a modified version to take into account the polymer-filler interaction.</description><creator>Kennedy, Mary A.</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Plastic crystals -- Growth</subject><subject>Crystallization</subject><subject>Silica</subject><subject>Crystalline polymers</subject><title>Crystallization and melting behavior studies of un-nucleated and silica-nucleated isotactic polystyrene and isotactic poly(propylene oxide)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d504rk980.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/41687j152</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kp78gh08h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Compositionally related glasses and ceramics of the Na$ sb2$O$ cdot$CaO$ cdot$Al$ sb2$O$ sb3 cdot$TiO$ sb2 cdot$SiO$ sb2$ system (sphene glass-ceramics) doped with Eu$ sp{3+}$ were examined using site-selective spectroscopic techniques (FLN). In sphene glass-ceramics, Eu$ sp{3+}$ preferentially partitions into the crystalline sphene phase. The partition ratio is concentration dependent, decreasing at higher concentrations, because of the limited solid solubility of Eu$ sp{3+}$ in sphene. The concentration occurs at the time of phase separation; Eu$ sp{3+}$ preferentially enters the more ionic (CaO, TiO$ sb2$)- rich droplet phase which eventually becomes sphene. In sphene, Eu$ sp{3+}$ substitutes for Ca$ sp{2+}$ appearing in three different sites caused by associated charge compensation defects. From an analysis of the FLN spectra of the different glasses, the framework for a model describing the coordination shell of Eu$ sp{3+}$ in oxide glasses is developed. The model suggests that Eu$ sp{3+}$ behaves as a network forming ion or quasi-molecular complex. The model is used to explain qualitative features of Eu$ sp{3+}$ FLN spectra including the dependence of the clustering of points of the major crystal field parameter ratios plot on the relative number of non-bridging oxygen ions and Eu$ sp{3+}$ ions in the glass.</description><creator>Belliveau, Thomas F.</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Glass-ceramics</subject><subject>Luminescence spectroscopy</subject><subject>Europium -- Analysis</subject><subject>Radioactive waste disposal -- Research</subject><subject>Sphene</subject><title>Site selective spectroscopy of Eu3+ in the glass ceramic forming system Na2O.CaO.Al2O3.TiO2.SiO2</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mc87pr02q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kp78gh08h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:12579s91d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The objective of the thesis was to examine the distribution, biogenesis and assembly of basement membrane components in situ. This goal was achieved by immunolocalizing laminin, collagen IV, heparan sulfate proteoglycan and other components using 5 and 15nm colloidal gold particles. The distribution of these components, showed them to be ubiquitously localized throughout the thickness of all basement membranes examined. In "thick" basement membranes: Reichert's membrane and the matrix of the mouse EHS tumor, and in the "thin" common basement membranes, the components were localized to the cord network (Inoue et al., 1985). Despite some variations between tissues, quantitation of gold particles indicated a tendency for the molar ratio of laminin:collagen:proteoglycan to be 1:1:0.2 in the thick and 1:1:1 in the thin basement membranes. The biogenesis of laminin and collagen IV was examined in the endodermal cells producing Reichert's membrane. Both were co-localized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus and secretory granules, corresponding to the pathway followed during processing. Since the components are believed to self-aggregate after secretion, the molar ratios were used as guidelines to combine the three molecules in vitro, at 35$ sp circ$C. A precipitate formed, which in the electron microscope showed three main structures, one of these had the thickness, immunohistochemical and fine, ultrastructural characteristics of authentic basement membrane. Hence, basement membrane was reconstructed in vitro.</description><creator>Grant, Derrick Shawn</creator><date>1987</date><subject>Biology, Anatomy.</subject><title>The application of immunogold histochemistry to the quantitative analyses of basement membranes /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t722h959x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/12579s91d</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anatomy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n296wz74m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is an investigation of the place and function of repentance in the theology of Paul as determined by the critical application of the categories "getting-in" and staying-in" to the passages where the term is used and to passages where the concept may be implied.

Paradoxically combining realistic and metafictional conventions, these works establish an ironic dialogue with the past, employing yet simultaneously subverting traditional fictional techniques. In this dissertation, I subject five new, old novels--John Barth's The Sot-Weed Factor and LETTERS, Erica Jong's Fanny, T. Coraghessan Boyle's Water Music, and John Fowles's The French Lieutenant's Woman--to a detailed analysis, which compares the parodic role of archaic devices in each contemporary novel to the serious use made of such devices in the past. I argue that new, old novels, by juxtaposing old and new world views, foreground the ontological concerns of fiction and suggest that literary representation is constitutive rather than imitative of reality. Their examination of the relationship between fiction and reality places them at the centre of contemporary concern.</description><creator>Cooke, Stewart J.</creator><date>1987</date><subject>Barth, John, 1930- Sot-weed factor.</subject><subject>Parody -- History -- 20th century</subject><subject>Boyle, T.

Intrathecal administration of substance P and other analogous peptides to the L5 vertebral level produced a dose-dependent decrease in reaction time to tail withdrawal from a noxious radiant heat source. Similar administration of VIP, galanin, CGRP, angiotensin II, somatostatin and TRH failed to mimic these effects of substance P. As substance P was found to equally decrease the reaction time in spinal transected rats, it is concluded that this facilitation occurs via a spinal mechanism alone. Administration of substance P at the lower thoracic level increased reaction time. Evidence is provided to suggest that this increase in reaction time may involve the release of an opioid peptide into the circulation from the adrenal medullae. Noxious cutaneous stimulation to the tail of anaesthetized rat produced a facilitation of the tail flick reflex which was similar to that induced by exogenous administration of substance P. This decrease in reaction time was attenuated by intrathecal administration of a substance P antagonist. These results support an earlier hypothesis made by others that substance P may be involved in the transmission of nociceptive information in the spinal cord.</description><creator>Cridland, Ruth Anne</creator><date>1987</date><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><title>Roles of substance P in the mediation or modulation of a nociceptive reflex in the rat</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8623hz40n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hh63sw572</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physiology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fb494917h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The propagation of electromagnetic fields is described by the vector Helmholtz equation. Finite element analysis of the vector Helmholtz equation involves complications such as spurious modes that do not arise in the scalar Helmholtz equation. Both driven vector field problems as well as vector eigenvalue problems may be corrupted by these divergent, nonphysical fields. Additionally, boundary and interface conditions in vector field problems are more complex than in scalar problems. In this thesis, the cause of spurious modes is analyzed and a condition called the inclusion condition is shown to eliminate the spurious modes. Mixed order covariant projection finite elements are shown to avoid spurious corruptions in both driven and eigenvalue problems. The proposed elements do not involve globally imposed constraints or penalty functions, and boundary and interface conditions are easily imposed.</description><creator>Crowley, Christopher W.</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Eigenvalues</subject><subject>Vector fields</subject><title>Mixed order covariant projection finite elements for vector fields</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cr56n184r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fb494917h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):35875</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
