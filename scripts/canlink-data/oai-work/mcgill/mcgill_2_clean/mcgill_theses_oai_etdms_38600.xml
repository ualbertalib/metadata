Cronbach's correlation coefficients were all higher than 0.70 for the different dimensions and interviews. In fact, for interview 1 to 3, the mean (SD) for the SF-36 PCS ranged from 53.0 (7.5) to 53.5 (6.5), for the SF-36 MCS from 49.5 (10.2) to 52.4 (10.4), for the EQ5D 81.7 (22.3) to 86.9 (18.6), for the VAS from 83.5 (15.6) to 86.9 (10.3) and for the SG 87.8 (19.6) to 89.7 (17.7). For both the VAS and SG, health states of active TB subjects ranked lower than those of other subjects (p-value ranging from 0.002 to 0.11 for each instruments and interviews, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). These measures of health-related quality of life and health utilities appeared feasible and reliable in this subject population.

Model domains were of two types, large raised bog type (LRBT) and kettle bog type (KBT), and were made to undergo various levels of meteorological forcing (water deficit). Substrate, too, was varied in order to determine its importance on reversals. Domain-wide reversals were successfully simulated in LRBT systems, but not in KBT systems. Although simulated flow patterns matched field-observed patterns, both pre- and post-drought, simulated reversals occurred more quickly than in the field. This may be due to insufficiently distributed parameters, such as hydraulic conductivity. Reversals were easily terminated by simulating non-drought conditions. In the LRBT system, reversal duration decreased, and time-to-reversal increased, with a decrease in drought severity. Increasing drought severity in KBT systems had the opposite effect on the duration of semi-reversed flow patterns, suggesting a possibly different/additional mechanism for flow reversals in KBT systems. Hydraulic conductivity had an appreciable effect on flow reversal evolution, though neither changing porosity, nor differences in catotelm layering had a great effect.</description><creator>Colautti, Dennis.</creator><contributor>Roulet, Nigel T.

The purpose of this study is to measure total toxaphene levels in food samples commonly consumed by the Canadian Inuit and study the relationship between concentrations of total toxaphene and individual congeners. A total of 127 Inuit food samples were collected for toxaphene analysis. Total toxaphene and the specific toxaphene congeners including Parlar #26, #40/41, #42, #44, #50 and #62 were detected in the food samples. Total toxaphene concentrations ranged from 13 to 2800 ng/g and various congener concentrations ranged from 0 to 610 ng/g. Concentrations of total toxaphene were strongly correlated with congener concentration in marine mammals and weaker in fish. The sum of congeners Parlar #26, #50 and #62 accounted for 0--15% of total toxaphene in fish and 0--66% in marine mammals. Regression models were used to estimate total toxaphene based on individual or combinations of congener concentrations. Dietary intake was estimated to be 1.07 and 0.78 mug/kg body weight per day in Chesterfield Inlet and Igloolik. Our results show that there is no general conversion factor that can be used to estimate total toxaphene concentrations based on congener measurements.</description><creator>Chu, Fong Lam, 1976-</creator><contributor>Chan, H.

A search for angiogenesis inhibitors has been the focus of many investigations. One such inhibitor, which caught the attention of many researchers, is 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME). 2-ME is an endogenous metabolite of estradiol-17beta. The current study was undertaken to characterize the angiostatic effects of 2-ME in human microvascular endothelial cells. Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-beta) has been shown to play a vital role in regulating endothelial cell growth and differentiation, as well as apoptosis. We, therefore, investigated whether TGF-beta is modulated by 2-ME using the human microvascular endothelial cell line, HMEC-1. Findings suggest that 2-ME mediated apoptosis in human microvascular endothelial cells involve SAPK/JNK pathway and caspase-3 while the activation of p38 kinase pathway may represent a survival signal to counteract the 2-ME induced apoptotic events.

It is likely that the vertebrate TnI gene family arose from a single TnI gene present in early chordate ancestors. Analysis of transcriptional control mechanisms of the TnI gene of a primitive chordate, such as the ascidian Ciona intestinalis, may therefore provide insight into the regulatory mechanisms of the vertebrate ancestral TnI gene. As an initial step in such a study, I localized transcriptional control regions within 1.5 kb of 5'-flanking DNA of the Ciona TnI gene. I prepared a series of deletion constructs in which Ciona TnI 5'-flanking DNA segments were fused to a nuclear-targeted beta-galactosidase reporter gene. Constructs were introduced into fertilized Ciona eggs by electroporation, and following development up to the mid tailbud stage (12 h), reporter gene expression was assessed by whole-mount beta-galactosidase histochemistry.

This study examined experts' views on the feasibility of, benefits of, and barriers to the establishment of safer injection rooms in Canada. The qualitative model involved interviews (N = 6) with a range of professionals in the area of addictions. Analysis of the data revealed that there is an urgent need for expanded and improved harm reduction strategies, that safer injection rooms could offer many benefits to Canadians, that several debates exist with regard to the policies and services related to safer injection rooms, and that safer injection rooms, as well as alternative initiatives, must be considered if Canada wishes to promote health among drug users and wider communities. The implications of the findings for social work and further research are discussed. Recommendations include expanded educational initiatives for professionals and the public, intensive research related to the specific Canadian context, and the establishment of a trial protocol.</description><creator>Malowaniec, Leah.</creator><contributor>Rowe, William (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Hypodermic needles -- Safety measures.</subject><subject>Injections -- Safety measures.</subject><subject>Drug addicts -- Health and hygiene.</subject><title>An analysis of opportunities and barriers related to the establishment of safer injection rooms in Canada /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3j333413b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dz010r931</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4f16c443g</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study examined the relationship between the principle of normalization and the concept of quality of life of intellectually challenged adults living in the community. The effect of demographic variables on the quality of life of this population was examined. The sample consisted of sixty respondents from four agencies (one from Montreal and three from Ottawa) providing services to intellectually challenged adults. Cummins' (1997) Comprehensive Quality of Life---Intellectual Disability Fifth Edition (ComQol-I5) was used. Both objective and subjective quality of life scores were calculated. The major findings were: (1) the subjective scores were higher than the objective scores; (2) a number of subjective scores were positively correlated with the objective score for community (attending leisure/social activities, belonging to a group and/or holding a position of responsibility) and (3) higher functioning respondents (income, diagnosis, education and living arrangements) had significantly higher overall quality of life scores.

Seven parents representing four adult disabled children, were individually interviewed using the Family Support and Coping Interview. The parents then participated in three groups sessions to discuss the commonality of 'never-ending' parenthood. The parents, who average 70.9 years of age, have been sole caregivers for middle-aged children. Their displaced life cycle responsibilities, their vision of a solution and the need to socially publicize their predicament were major themes requiring advocacy with policy makers and government funders. Research into the care of those who cannot manage independent living is imperative, particularly as social thinking and fiscal policies espouse the benefits of the autonomous family.</description><creator>Pilon-McDonald, Lucille.</creator><contributor>Hopmeyer, Estelle (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Brain-damaged children -- Care.</subject><subject>Adult children of aging parents.</subject><subject>Adult children living with parents.</subject><title>Aging parents of adult children with acquired brain injury : future need</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p8418p98p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3b591b12k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z603r0270</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Sixty teachers from the Ottawa-Carleton region of Canada were surveyed to measure their knowledge of child maltreatment risk indicators, knowledge of reporting procedures, and the frequency of reporting sexual abuse, physical abuse, and neglect.

Multiple Regression analyses demonstrated that the knowledge of child maltreatment risk factors and the knowledge of reporting procedures were not predictive of reporting. It was found that the teachers sampled were very knowledgeable of the basic risk indicators of child maltreatment and reporting procedures and policy.

Models were developed to evaluate the influence of host breeding system on transposon populations. Modeling results suggest that the selfing rate is likely to have important effects on the abundance and polymorphism patterns of transposable elements in plant genomes. A primary characterization of diversity and abundance of transposons in the self-pollinating species Arabidopsis thaliana was conducted using genomic sequencing data, providing strong evidence for recent element mobility. Utilizing this information, a PCR-based approach was implemented to examine transposon dynamics in populations of Arabidopsis thaliana and its outcrossing relative, Arabidopsis lyrata. The results provide evidence for the importance of purifying selection in controlling transposon abundance in outcrossing populations, but not in selfers. Differences observed between the species are consistent with the hypothesis that host breeding systems influence the selective pressure acting on transposons.</description><creator>Wright, Stephen, 1975-</creator><contributor>Schoen, Daniel J.

We wanted to identify which signaling pathways are responsible for these changes. We observed that chronic treatment of progenitors with BDNF or NT-3, but not NGF resulted in changes in morphology, visualized by MAP2 staining. BDNF treatment led to an increase in primary neurites in calbindin- and calretinin-positive cells when compared with control, but had no effect on proliferation of the proportion of interneurons. We conclude that BDNF enhances the differentiation of cortical neurons. To investigate the role of Trk signaling in cortical neurons, we generated recombinant adenoviruses which carried either wild type or mutated forms of TrkA which inhibit binding and activation of some of its major downstream effectors, namely, SNT, SHC and PLCgamma. Future work should elucidate the role of Trk signaling in central nervous system using these vectors.</description><creator>Wong, Josée F. K., 1972-</creator><contributor>Kaplan, David R.

However, this potential has been largely undermined by its costly causality violation restorations. Minimizing this cost has been one of the challenging issues facing Time Warp scheme. In this thesis, we present "dependence list cancellation", a direct cancellation technique in Time Warp. This novel approach provides an early cancellation of erroneous events, from which the propagation of these "bad" events is prevented. It is oriented towards a distributed environment, as exemplified by a network of workstations. The dependence list can also provide "event filtering" function which detects "bad" future events to avoid, their processing, and provide minimizing the sending of anti-messages. Our experiments show that the proposed method results in a dramatic reduction in the cost of processing causality violations when compared to Time Warp.</description><creator>Zhang, Jing Lei, 1962-</creator><contributor>Tropper, Carl (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>The dependence list in time warp /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4t64gq096.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z316q3299</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q811km48b</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We give a brief review of the bosonic and Type II string models, concentrating on matters of symmetry. In particular, we discuss how modular invariance leads to the GSO projections in the RNS superstring formalism, and contrast the GSO conditions arising from an embedding in flat target space with those arising from an embedding in a toroidally compactified target space. These results are then used to demonstrate the stability of a compact spacetime, the AdS soliton, against the formation of tachyonic winding modes in the low curvature limit. This constitutes further evidence for a positive energy conjecture for asymptotically, locally AdS spacetimes, with the AdS soliton as the minimum energy solution within the context of superstring theory.</description><creator>Winters, David J.</creator><contributor>Myers, Robert C.

On day 107 of gestation a total of 59 large white sows were selected, blocked by parity and randomly allotted to one of three diets, 15% flaxseed (FL), 10% fullfat soybean (SB) or a control commercial (CO) diet containing corn and soybean meal. Diets were isocaloric and isonitrogenous but differed in fat content and FA composition. Colostrum and milk were collected soon after farrowing and on day 7, respectively, for fatty acid and chemical analysis. Dietary treatments did not affect sow feed consumption, weight loss, number of live pig born and weaned per litter. Similarly, pig birth weights, and day 7, 14, and 21 weights did not differ among treatment groups. FL significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased linolenic (LNA C18:3co3) and decreased palmitic (C16:0) and oleic (C18:1) acids in colostrum. FL also significantly (p &lt; 0.001) increased LNA and arachidonic acid (C20:4) in milk, while it decreased myristic (C14:0), palmitic and palmitoleic (C16:1) acids. Chemical analysis showed no significant differences in total solids (TS) and energy value of colostrum while a significant (p &lt; 0.05) increase in TS, fat concentration and energy value was observed in milk from FL. A total of 335 piglets were used in the plasma study of lipid metabolites. Triglyceride (TG), cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and glucose were not affected by dietary treatment (p &gt; 0.05). Feeding FL to sows during late gestation and lactation enriches sow milk and piglets with LNA.</description><creator>Oresanya, Temitope Frederick.</creator><contributor>Chavez, E. R.

Synthesis of atrial (ANP), brain (BNP), and C-type (CNP) natriuretic peptides occurs mainly in the heart and brain and has been identified recently in the female reproductive tract. The expression of ANP and CNP, as well as their cognate guanylyl cyclase receptors (NPR-A and NPR-B, respectively), have been detected in the rat ovary. We have shown previously that the expression of the natriuretic peptides and their receptors, in the rat ovary, is modulated by the estrous cycle. Since estrogen and the gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)) are important regulators of follicular development and ovarian function we hypothesized that expression of the natriuretic peptide system is modulated by these hormones. In order to test this hypothesis, the expression of the natriuretic peptide system (peptide and receptor) was evaluated in ovarian cells (granulosa and residual tissue cells) obtained from immature female rats treated with either diethylstilbestrol (DES), an estrogen analogue, or equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG), a gonadotropin which possesses both LH and FSH activity.

This study presents direct evidence that stress-induced phosphorylation of NFH in both differentiated PC12 cells and cultured sensory neurons is inhibited by CEP-1347 (KT7515), a specific inhibitor of SAPK activation. In addition, long-term treatment of unstressed sensory neurons with CEP-1347 decreased the phosphorylation state of NFH in neurites. CEP-1347 differentially inhibited the activation of various SAPK isoforms in neuronal cell body and neurite fractions. Specifically, activation of a 55 kDa SAPK isoform in the neurite fraction was highly sensitive to CEP-1347 inhibition, with an IC50 of about 0.02 muM, while IC50 values for other SAPK species were at least 10-fold higher. The data indicate that SAPKs are involved in both constitutive phosphorylation of axonal NFH and stress-induced phosphorylation of perikaryal NFH in cultured sensory neurons and that SAPKs in the two neuronal compartments are activated by different signaling pathways.</description><creator>O'Ferrall, Erin K.</creator><contributor>Mushynski, W.

Studies have demonstrated that these antagonists act on the transporter by interacting with amino acid residues within certain transmembrane domains (TM4 and 9). Experiments in our laboratory have identified three novel sites involved in inhibitor interactions (PP157--8, E350, and G356). The general focus of this thesis was to study the structure-function relationship of NHE1. One of the aims of this thesis was to assess whether mutations at these novel sites also affected transport kinetics (i.e., Na+ and H+ affinity). The results showed that neither Na+ nor H+ affinities were significantly altered with any of the mutations analyzed. The next objective was to investigate the nature of the interaction between the exchanger and pharmacological agents, by measuring transport activity in the presence of substituted guanidinium antagonists. The results suggest an interaction between L167 and the chlorine moiety at position 3 of the benzoyl group of a novel benzoyl guanidinium compound, while G356 appears to interact with the chlorine moiety at position 4 (rather than position 3) of the benzene ring. The last objective was to define the membrane topology of NHE1. The methodology involves reintroducing cysteine residues into a cysteine-less mutant NHE1 and assessing their accessibility with thiol-reactive agents. Unfortunately, these results were inconclusive and further optimization of the assay conditions is required.</description><creator>Iannuzzi, Pietro.</creator><contributor>Orlowski, John (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><title>Delineation of structural domains of the sodiumhydrogen exchanger isoform 1</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/47429c03z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f4752j59g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physiology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7d278v985</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Ecosystems involve highly non-linear interactions between species and their environments over wide ranges of scales. These interactions give rise to population number densities that are highly intermittent in both space and time. The simplest hypothesis about the variability of individual density fields is that they are scale invariant in space-time. For some cases, such as plankton, this has been demonstrated empirically. In addition, at a fixed space-time location there is a well-established information theory approach for treating the density statistics for different species. In this "species space", there are already two scaling biodiversity models: the (mono) fractal model and the lognormal model. The simplest treatment combining real and species space scaling is obtained by considering an anisotropic multifractal cascade in a (5-D) species-space-time space. With the help of a unique data base involving nearly three hundred different species densities, each over a spatial range of approximately 40, 0.5m x 0.5m samples from six underwater sites in the Saint Lawrence Estuary, this simple "superscaling" model is tested. It is shown that the scaling of all species densities is compatible with a "bilinear" multifractal model, where an "elliptical dimension" parameter characterises the anisotropy of species-real space. This information is then used to numerically simulate the spatial variability of joint species densities, and it is discussed how this framework can be used to define scale invariant measures of biodiversity.</description><creator>Ieraci, Luciano A.</creator><contributor>Lovejoy, Shaun (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Biology, Ecology.</subject><subject>Biology, Biostatistics.</subject><title>Spatial intermittency, biodiversity, and multifractals</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hd76s192s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7d278v985</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:c534fq68t</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In a hard real-time system, the notion of time is very critical. For this reason, specific designing methods and different scheduling algorithms were developed. However, the scheduling algorithms are dependent on task attributes that are artifacts from system design, and the designers still do generate them by a trial and error process. [SH96] presents a resource conscious design method to systematically generate these attributes so that the task deadlines and the system end-to-end constraints are met. Using this method and the Rate Monotonic scheduling algorithm, I developed a tool that calculates the response time of each task of the system and a per-constraint heuristic parameter called "gain". Furthermore, it allows the designer to interactively change the timing attributes and to quickly check their effect on the system schedulability.</description><creator>Jabbour, Georges Safwan.</creator><contributor>Avis, David (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>A tool for resource conscious design of distributed real-time systems using end-to-end deadline constraints /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qr46r2825.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fq68t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:js956h69t</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis provides a survey of several fundamental topics in the representation theory of finite semigroups.

This model was developed for the purpose of learning a mapping from an input space to an output space. A specific problem that occurs in the mining industry was used to develop and test the model's ability to learn the mapping between a three-dimensional input volume and a three-dimensional output volume. In this case, the mapping was a consequence of the industrial processes used in mining as well as the properties of the material being mined. Three main computational tools were combined in this work to form the complete mine stope prediction model. The three modules are a learning module, an optimisation module, and an overall network architecture. The overall network architecture is a 3-D lattice of cellular automata (CA) and has the capability to implicitly capture the complexities in shape that render other types of models arduous or inapplicable. The learning module uses a Discrete Time Cellular Neural Network (DTCNN) to store and recall information about a given mapping. The optimisation module uses the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm to perform a non-linear optimisation on the set of weights used by the DTCNN. Variations of the model, and different experiments, were performed to test and explore the model in depth. Concepts such as "Small-Worlds" and "Forgetting Factor" were investigated. The applicability of a Partial Least Squares (PLS) model as an alternative to the DTCNN transition rule was also explored.</description><creator>Côté, Brendan.</creator><contributor>Therien, Denis (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><subject>Artificial Intelligence.</subject><title>Applicability of advanced computational networks to the modelling of complex geometry</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c247dt89b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bk128c686</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ff365702b</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Ecological research aimed at the conservation of useful plants has rarely considered the spatial distribution of resources nor the potential implications for management. In this thesis I examined the spatial patterning of a group of 23 useful plant species on the 3,500 ha territory of a Kuna community in Darien, Panama. A systematic random sampling scheme was used to survey the distribution and abundance of the species, as well as the physical environment. A series of canonical analyses was conducted to evaluate the species-environment relationships and to identify spatial structures in the species distributions left unexplained by the environmental variables. Four distinct distribution patterns were identified among the species; these were most strongly explained by land-use, the degree of canopy closure and topography. Significant spatial structures, independent of the environmental variables, were related to anthropogenic pressures and an edaphic gradient. The habitat associations of the individual species are described and data on one species, Sabal mauritiiformis , is used to illustrate the utility of these data in the management of plant resources on human landscapes.</description><creator>Dalle, Sarah Paule.</creator><contributor>Potvin, Catherine (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Plants, Useful -- Panama -- Darien (Province) -- Geographical distribution.</subject><subject>Cuna Indians -- Ethnobotany -- Panama -- Darien (Province)</subject><subject>Sabal -- Panama -- Darien (Province) -- Geographical distribution.</subject><title>The spatial distribution of traditional plant resources on an indigenous territory (Darien, Panama) and implications for management /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5d86p2090.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ff365702b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fq977w82v</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The retinoblastoma (RB) family of proteins plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation. Its members, p105/Rb, p107 and p130, interact with the E2F and DP family of transcription factors to regulate transcription of essential cell cycle and DNA synthesis genes. Several reports have mapped the regulation of E217 by RB family members to the "pocket" domain of these proteins. We demonstrate here that RBP2, a pocket-binding protein that encodes multiple DNA-binding and protein-protein interaction domains, is a transcriptional repressor. Overexpression of RBP2 inhibits E2F-dependent transcription and inhibits cellular growth. The growth suppression activity of RBP2 could not be associated with a single domain within the protein but the transcriptional repression activity can be mapped to a minimal 17 kDa fragment located at the extreme N-terminus of RBP2 that can repress transcription when expressed alone but requires the C-terminus in the context of the full-length protein.</description><creator>Côté, Richard Gaston.</creator><contributor>Branton, Philip E.

The IPSec protocol suite developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) makes it possible to implement secure communication channels or virtual private network (VPN) over the Internet.
