This study is based on a qualitative methodology. To collect the data, twenty-six members of the organization--eighteen visible minorities, four French Canadian and four managers--were interviewed. The analysis of the collected data showed a wide range of experiences within the sample. The promotion issue is the most important. Many respondants want promotions within the organisation and find that their progression is slow. Some respondants acknowledged that their supervisors were prejudiced against them as visible minorities, which they thought could slow down their career prospects. Overall, eleven out of the eighteen visible minorities interviewed believe that their special status has an impact on their experience at the bank. The subtle character of the disadvantage perceived by respondants should be the object of further research.</description><creator>Gagné, Esther.</creator><contributor>Smith, Michael (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Bank employees -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><subject>Women -- Employment -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><subject>Discrimination in employment -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><subject>Minorities -- Employment -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><title>Expériences de membres de communautés culturelles en milieu de travail : étude de cas d'une entreprise</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nv935501w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0g354h339</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Sociology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:d504rn311</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:08:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>While much attention has been paid to the events which followed the publication of Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses (1988), there has been little detailed examination of the role of Islam in that novel and in the rest of Salman Rushdie's fiction, notably Midnight's Children (1981) and Shame (1983). His portrayals of Islam and Islamic societies are not easily recognizable via the traditional structures of the academic study of Islam. His divergence from the vast majority of Muslim tradition and experience can be seen firstly through his own experiences in India, England, and Pakistan; and secondly through his provocative literary exploration of religious beliefs, something which has few precedents in the history of Islam. By using Islamic elements and symbols in the same way that Western literatures have explored religious themes, Rushdie presents irreverent satire and often scathing criticism of many aspects of Muslim societies and culture. The most significant aspect of this critique is the attempt to subvert what Mohammed Arkoun called "Islamic logocentrism," the tendency to confine all discourse about Islam to a certain narrow field of textual interpretation. Rushdie's treatment of religion is informed by an ideal which sees reading and writing for one's own purposes to be the highest form of spiritual exercise, and when Islam is subordinated to the writer's imagination, he has little reason to uphold the authority or sanctity of its precepts, principles, or history.</description><creator>Fudge, Bruce G.</creator><contributor>Boullata, Issa J.

The problem space essentially contains considerations of instructional goals and constraints, technological resources, and theoretical considerations. The problem space was augmented by an analysis of the strategic processes relevant in instructional design, in particular planning, and by an analysis of one specific technological resource, HyperCard. Concurrent think-aloud verbal protocols and computer operations protocols (video recordings of the users' interactions with the computer) were gathered from three university students enrolled in an educational technology course on developing courseware. Subjects were using HyperCard to develop instructional environments for individual course projects. The transcribed protocols were analyzed using a coding scheme based on the instructional-design problem space and planning model. Two types of analyses are reported: proportions of segments concerning different types of design and planning operations and descriptive representations of overall protocol goal structures and plans.

A letter justifies and exists only by virtue of the distance and absence of the other person, and its appears that Flaubert resolutely availed himself of this mode of communication with Louise, and thus preserved efficiently the necessary solitude and silence for the composition of his work. The first part of the inquiry, which attempts to define the status and function of Louise in the Correspondence, is devoted to the eloquent forcefulness and the sheer quality of Flaubert's exposition. The second part of this work focuses on the originality of Flaubert's ideas in the letters and how they are representative of this life long literary beliefs. This so called love correspondence is literally permeated with literary discussion, and the reader of these letters quickly begins to wonder why Flaubert elected as his privileged correspondent a mistress who was incapable of understanding or sharing his profound convictions on aesthetic matters.</description><creator>Fisher, Martine</creator><contributor>Duquette, Jean-Pierre (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Colet, Louise, 1810-1876 -- Correspondence</subject><subject>Flaubert, Gustave, 1821-1880 -- Correspondence</subject><title>La correspondance de Flaubert à Louise Colet, 1851-1854</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7m01bn742.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vt150m087</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5h73px991</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:08:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Mothers, in female literature, have often been represented through the eyes of their daughters; only recently have they begun to speak for themselves. The object of this thesis is to analyse the portrayal of mothers and daughters in several modern short stories written by women from 1961 onwards, in order to understand the principal elements of an often difficult and ambivalent relationship. In the texts written from "daughterly" perspectives, mothers represent regression and lack of autonomy; therefore, daughters tend to dissociate themselves from their mothers in an attempt to avoid the cycle of repetition typical of this relationship. In these texts, daughters speak for and about their mothers and hence do not allow them to articulate their own subjectivity. However, as daughters reach adulthood, they are able to accept their mothers and a new dialogue emerges. In the texts written from "motherly" perspectives, mothers speak about the responsibility and the guilt which the "institution" of motherhood confers upon them. Although they acknowledge their powerlessness in patriarchal society, these mothers nonetheless hope for better lives for their daughters. By speaking for themselves, they attempt to find an alternative to the traditional role of the mother. The collection of short stories that follows, Demain tu comprendras, presents mothers and daughters at various stages in their lives and in their relationships. They are written from both "motherly" and "daughterly" perspectives.</description><creator>Fillmore, Patricia</creator><contributor>Chapdelaine, Annick (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Mothers and daughters in literature</subject><title>Mères et filles : discours divergents ; suivi de, Demain tu comprendras</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f4752j84t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5h73px991</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3t945s83m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:08:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this study was to investigate whether music students could be systematically trained, by means of a guided listening course, to improve the reliability and validity of their evaluation of solo voice performance. Fifty-four music students were randomly and evenly divided into two groups. The treatment group took an 8-hour home study guided listening course, which focussed on twelve criteria of vocal production, derived from a previous study with expert voice teachers. At the end of the course, treatment subjects rated, on a seven-point Likert scale, twelve criteria and "overall score" for each of 25 performances of the same excerpt. The excerpt chosen was a portion of Mozart's lied "Ridente la calma". It was performed by 19 singers of differing voice classifications and achievement levels. Six of the performances were presented twice. The control group took the evaluation test, but received no treatment. Interjudge reliability, intrajudge reliability and validity were assessed for the two groups and for 22 expert voice teachers. Treatment subjects achieved significantly higher scores than control subjects for interjudge reliability and validity. No significant difference was found, however, for intrajudge reliability. The expert group achieved significantly higher scores for all three measures than either of the student groups. No significant differences were found between graduate students and undergraduate students, nor between voice major and non-voice majors. Treatment subjects scored higher than control subjects on validity of their evaluations of all twelve criteria and "overall score".</description><creator>Ekholm, Elizabeth</creator><contributor>Wapnick, Joel (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Listening</subject><subject>Singing</subject><title>The effect of guided listening on evaluation of solo vocal performanance</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zc77sr96r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3t945s83m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pc289k96n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:08:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Women's exit from employment has been explained in relation to their individual characteristics and family status, but little attention has been given to the relationship between women's experience in employment and their decision to leave. Attrition data indicates that women become even more likely to leave the Canadian Forces, relative to their male counterparts, after 10 years of service. A qualitative approach was used to explore the relationship between organizational environment and exit among women who left the Canadian Forces after serving more than 10, but less than 20 years. The analysis, which is based on interviews with 23 women, suggests that although organizational policies and regulations are evolving in attempts to integrate women, the experiences of women as women within a male-dominated organization contribute significantly to the attrition of women from that environment.</description><creator>Davis, Karen D.

Chapter one is about Harold Bloom's theory of the Anxiety of Influence. Bloom's argument is that literary history is shaped by the anxiety of "strong" poets at their belatedness. I show that he depends upon a subjective interpretation of literary production in order to defend a rigidly traditional canon. Chapter two deals with theories of intertextuality, principally those of Julia Kristeva and Michael Riffaterre. As alternatives to theories of influence, neither proves satisfactory. Both founder on the contradictory goal to explain all literature, at the expense of recognizing literary diversity. Chapter three concerns literary variations. These are texts which are deliberately premised on pre-existing texts. I focus on three examples from this class of literary texts which is not satisfactorily dealt with by any of the theories I consider. I pursue a less wide-ranging approach in order to unearth important features of literary variations.</description><creator>Bennett, Richard</creator><contributor>Livingston, Paisley (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Stoppard, Tom -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><subject>Kundera, Milan -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><subject>Rhys, Jean -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><subject>Intertextuality</subject><title>Variations : influence intertextuality, and Milan Kundera, Jean Rhys, and Tom Stoppard</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v405sc23c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1v53k007j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2227mr89f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:08:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Writers and poets who wrote in the "language of Venice" are far more numerous than is commonly reported in the history of Italian literature.

It is argued that the most plausible model for the rise of palatial society in LBA Argolis is one which acknowledges the interrelations and processes of feedback between these factors, of which trade and militarism may have been original motivating factors. Finally, it is suggested that the need to organize resource procurement and distribution were instrumental in the emergence of the Mycenaean palatial centers of LBA Argolis.</description><creator>Arvanitakis, Jan Alexandros</creator><contributor>Fossey, J.

In their rational approach to religion and the concern to modernize their societies the two leaders were guided by a secularist paradigm of the relationship of state and religion that each formulated. The abolition of the sultanate-caliphate system, the end of Islam as the state religion and the replacement of Shari/'a by Western codes demonstrated the impact of modernization and secularization on Turkey. The "polity-dominance secularization" of Mustafa Kemal along with, among other thing, the abolition of religious education, the banning of the mystical orders, and the mandatory use of Turkish in Islamic ritual, made Turkey a completely secular state. In Indonesia, secularization was meant not only to serve the cause of modernization but also has had a special significance for ensuring the religious minority's support of the political system. Sukarno's decision to establish a quasi-secular Pancasila state was guided by a concern for political unity. However, unlike Mustafa Kemal, Sukarno avoided the strategy of overt opposition to religion, in order not to entail unacceptable political risks. Though the Indonesian Islamic parties have frequently opposed Sukarno's secularism, the Islamic ideological orientation was significantly moderated by Sukarno's pragmatic syncretism, as embodied in his manifesto NASAKOM (nationalism, religion and communism). Unlike in Turkey, Islamic parties were recognized, and Islamic courts and the system of religious education were integrated into the structure of state in Indonesia.</description><creator>Anshori, Ibnu</creator><contributor>Adams, Charles J.

In the history of Islamic society in Aceh, these scholars, the 'ulama' dayah, have shown great initiative in guiding their society as it sought solutions to various problems. Their response was not confined merely to religious matters but also extended to the economic, political and social problems. The impact of modern science and technology has led to many changes in economics, agriculture, medicine, and other fields. All these changes have to be evaluated in terms of their status in Islamic law, because Muslims have always sought to lead their lives in accordance with Islamic teachings. The 'ulama' dayah, have contributed to meeting the challenge of resolving such problems. In formulating their decisions, the 'ulama' dayah usually refer to the standard texts of the four classical schools of Islamic law. The reliance on classical texts is justified by their conviction that present-day 'ulama' are unable to exercise ijtihad independently since they lack the qualifications which have been traditionally demanded of a mujtahid.</description><creator>Amiruddin, M.

Some poor communities in developing countries, rarely consider inadequate excreta disposal a problem. In absence of sanitation facilities, these communities rely on natural processes to dispose of their waste, wherein the practice of defecating in the open fields or on surface water is prevalent. In communities occupying coastal, waterfront and low-lying areas, human waste is directly disposed of into the surface water such as rivers, canals and sea or in the mudflat to await the tide. These surface waters, however, are often the communities' sources of food, and water for drinking, domestic and personal cleaning. Studies on sanitation show that contaminated water and human wastes are major factors in the transmission of serious diseases in the developing world. This thesis aims to contribute to the process of selecting appropriate sanitation technologies for the low-income coastal and waterfront communities. The thesis analyzes sanitation and environmental conditions in the coastal communities of Puerto Princesa, Palawan Province, Philippines, to identify the important considerations for the provision of sanitation systems in these communities and hence, determine the feasible sanitation options.</description><creator>Navarro, Rachelle G.</creator><contributor>Sheppard, Adrian (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Sanitation -- Philippines -- Puerto Princesa</subject><subject>Sewage disposal -- Philippines -- Puerto Princesa</subject><title>Improving sanitation in coastal communities with special reference to Puerto Princesa, Palawan Province, Philippines</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j098zd15h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z316q353c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xg94hr685</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:09:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>As a result of the diversity of home buyers within the current housing market, houses are increasingly designed with but little user input into the overall design process. Home builders require the development of design tools which will accommodate user needs within specific housing markets. This thesis investigates the reaction of builders to the participation of home buyers in the design process through the use of computer-aided design (CAD). A review of the role of computers within the homebuilding industry is provided, including an historical overview of the use of CAD. The state of the art in CAD software applications is explored, with an assessment made of three low-cost software programs. Following a description of the existing design process in the homebuilding industry, a proposed system of user participation is outlined. A survey is taken of six builders in the Montreal and Ottawa regions to determine industry response to home buyer use of CAD as a design tool. An analysis of the survey results reveals that although the builders are not currently participants in such a process, they are tentatively positive in their receptiveness to the idea of user-related CAD. The builders express many reservations concerning the available CAD systems, and they declare little interest in adopting the process as it presently exists. The relevant computer programs are found wanting, revealing a need for further development of both the software applications and the procedure for implementing CAD at the user participation level. Suggestions are offered for improvements in the process to the benefit of builder, designer, and end user.</description><creator>Medek, Liza</creator><contributor>Friedman, Avi (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Architectural design -- Data processing</subject><subject>House construction -- Data processing</subject><subject>Computer-aided design</subject><subject>Architecture -- Human factors</subject><title>User participation in the housing design process through the use of computers : home builders' response</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z316q354n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94hr685</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:dj52w6753</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:09:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The process of shelter consolidation which has been observed in spontaneous settlements gave rise to the idea that it could be transferred to formal housing projects. The development and improvement of shelter for the urban poor through formal channels has also often followed a model of progressive development based on the provision of tenure and basic services. This was done through "sites and services" and "area upgrading" projects. An assessment of this process was carried out by observing two sites and services projects, Nannyville Gardens and De La Vega City, located in the Kingston Metropolitan Region, Jamaica. The manner and extent of consolidation is analyzed from data gathered during a survey which consisted of interviews with key informants and residents through a questionnaire, observation notes, physical measurements, slides and aerial photographs. The analysis dealt with variables such as; changes in the habitable area, the level of finishes undertaken at each stage of addition and the incorporation of space for home-Based Enterprises. The participants' physical priorities for housing are identified through the changes that have occurred in the variables over the life of both housing schemes. The results indicate that sufficient habitable area takes precedent over the level of finish in the early stages of dwelling development. The findings also suggest that the economic use of dwellings (renting, vending, trading and the provision of personal services) in formal low-income housing projects is an inevitable part of the consolidation process which should be given serious consideration when formulating such projects.</description><creator>Douglas, Kirkland S.

In the last decades, great efforts were made to solve the dramatic housing shortage and to improve the appalling living conditions in overcrowded areas. In 1990, the Beijing municipal government launched a program for the renewal of the old city center. A series of residential projects has been implemented in traditional neighborhoods since then which have affected the character of the old city and the lives of its residents. So far, very few studies have been conducted to assess the implementation of the renewal program. This thesis provides an overview of the regeneration projects implemented in the inner-city of Beijing since 1990. It identifies the diverse approaches currently used, along with their impacts on the traditional environment and its population. The main weaknesses of the renewal program are discussed and suggestions are made for its future transformation.</description><creator>Broudehoux, Anne-Marie</creator><contributor>Sheppard, Adrian (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Housing -- China -- Beijing</subject><subject>Community development, Urban -- China -- Beijing</subject><subject>Urban renewal -- China -- Beijing</subject><title>Neighborhood regeneration in Beijing : an overview of projects implemented in the inner city since 1990</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wd375z41w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8s45qb824</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:dz010s17d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:09:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The choice of subject for a history painting, long considered motivated by dramatic considerations, appears to be also, in the light of numerous documents, the expression of the painter's craft.

Three series of analyses were performed for the determination of thermostability of milk between pH 6.5 and 9. In the first 2 sections (A and B), the heat clotting time vs pH (HCT/pH) profiles of normal milk were measured. The effect of sialic acid (NANA) depletion on the HCT/pH profile was tested in a third series of experiments.

It is argued that, due to an unnecessary polarization of efforts, the success of sustainable development has been rather limited. Thus, after surveying the tension between the ecological, economic development and ethical dimensions of the concept, the author demonstrates the balancing role that international environmental law can have. Two hypotheses, the hypothesis of "concavity" and that of "convexity", are presented to contribute to a more appropriate understanding of the concept. A survey of international environmental agreements and instruments is undertaken in order to present sustainable development as a field in itself. It is further argued that sustainable development has not succeeded in enhancing environmental protection because of the erroneous efforts made to reduce it from a field of international environmental law to a norm of international environmental law. States, communities and individuals should be more concerned with developing new and firm principles in the field of sustainable development. These principles would eventually become the new norms of international and national law and thus, the cornerstone of an era of environmental protection that does not impinge upon the development that humankind is dependent upon.</description><creator>Zapata Lugo, José Vicente</creator><contributor>Brunnee, Jutta (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Law.</subject><subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</subject><subject>Environmental Sciences.</subject><title>Sustainable development : a role for international environmental law</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cz30pv652.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b8515q453</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1z40kv862</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:09:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Much of the world's food is produced in the wrong quantities in the wrong place. The disarray in world agricultural markets is a symptom of the failures of national agricultural policies in the industrialised world; which by maintaining high guaranteed prices to provide fair income to farmers have induced overproduction and excessive costs of surplus disposal. This thesis will examine the agricultural policies of the European Community and the United States to demonstrate the plethora of import barriers, subsidised export programmes and internal production subsidies in existence. The operationally-ineffective GATT regime for the agricultural sector will be outlined, with consideration being given to the international disputes that have arisen and have at times threatened the entire future of a liberal trading system. The importance of a multilateral solution to the distortions in world agricultural trade is clear; the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations offers the opportunity to move towards more market-oriented farm policies subject to greater international disciplines. The latter part of this thesis focuses on the possibilities for a successful conclusion to the ongoing negotiations in light of political and social realities.</description><creator>Woodburn, Ann</creator><date>1993</date><subject>Law.</subject><subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</subject><subject>Economics, Agricultural.</subject><title>Subsidies in world farm trade : the gatt as a forum to reach consensus for the liberalisation of the global market in agricultural products</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pr76f554b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1z40kv862</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:dv13zw481</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:09:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>At present there are several instruments that regulate air carrier's liability in international transportation. These international treaties are collectively known as the Warsaw System. Unfortunately, not all States are parties to the same instruments. In this thesis, four possibilities will be introduced for amendment of the System. These possibilities are as follows: ratification of the Guatemala City Protocol through the Montreal Protocol No. 3, an international treaty instrument, meant to update and amend the whole Warsaw System; the Italian solution, a national "remedy" taken without international consultations; the Japanese action, Japanese air carriers have waived entirely the Warsaw System's limits of liability; and finally, a recommendation to the EC Commission on a regional remedy in the form of a multilateral agreement where carriers raise the liability limits but otherwise the Warsaw provisions apply. Each possibility will be thoroughly examined in order to determine whether it is the best solution to the present crisis that the System is facing. At the end of this thesis one solution will be recommended for Iceland and other States to update the System. Other solutions are available but will not be discussed since they are not considered desirable for the aim of unification of air carrier's liability in international air carriage. What must be kept in mind when the four possibilities are being examined is that the aim of this thesis is to find a solution that unifies the air carrier liability regime and sometimes, in order to reach a uniform solution, a compromise must be reached.

Concerning the communications, the concept's architecture includes those for security as well as administrative communications of airlines and public correspondence of passengers. From this point of view, the requested globalisation will lead to regulatory and institutional changes, especially for non-security communications as they are regulated by each State overflown, according to Article 30 of the Chicago Convention. Every legal solution, of course, must take into account the chosen technology. In this domain, the experience of INMARSAT, with the mobile maritime communications by satellites, will be of tremendous importance. A period of transition, with regional initiatives, will be necessary too before the general implementation of the CNS/ATM concept.</description><creator>Verhaegen, Benoît M.</creator><contributor>Milde, M.

However, this is not always the case; they are recognizable and enforceable in some countries but not in others. Those countries that recognize and enforce awards are mostly developed countries, whereas those which do not are mainly developing countries. This study compares and contrasts the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards in developed and developing countries with a view to discovering why they are recognizable and enforceable in some countries but not in others. In this study, the United States is representative of the developed countries, while Indonesia represents the developing countries. Three factors determining whether or not foreign arbitral awards are recognizable and enforceable are identified in this study. They are the availability and adequacy of the legal framework, the attitude of the business community, and the attitude of the courts. The inquiry, accordingly, focuses on an examination of those factors in both countries. The examination reveals that the third factor is the determining element regarding the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards.</description><creator>Sutrisno, Nandang</creator><contributor>Jordan, Cally (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Law.</subject><subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</subject><title>Recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards in developed and developing countries : a comparison of the United States and Indonesia</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3b591b411.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d1989</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5x21th48s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:09:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>My aim is to demonstrate that professionals perceive they have a right to refuse to provide their services and are currently acting accordingly. This thesis explores whether a professional right to refuse services exists; if so, the limits of this right; and whether a professional 'right' to refuse services ought to exist and in what circumstances. This requires analysis of whether refusals to provide professional services might be considered unethical conduct according to existing codes of ethics and moral theories, unprofessional conduct within the norms of professional regulatory and disciplinary bodies, or illegal conduct according to Canadian law, in particular, human rights law. The issues are examined primarily with reference to physicians who treat patients and some comparisons are made with physician clinical researchers and lawyers. The shift from a duty-based system of professional service to a rights-based system of professional privileges has led to conflicting goals of professional self-regulation, and some possible resolutions to this conflict are explored.</description><creator>Sidarous, Mona</creator><contributor>Somerville, M.
