In 1935 Yukawa (1) introduced the hypothesis that the strong nucleon-nucleon interaction is due to the exchange of a kind of quantum having a mass intermediate between that of an electron and that of a nucleon. The pion which is identified as the Yukawa particle was found by Lattes et al.(2) in 1947. Since then the interaction between pion and nucleon has became one of the most interesting problems in physics. A lot of experimental and theoretical work has been done. Of course the fruitful mode of attack on the problem is to study the scattering process between pion and nucleon. The effective range approximation and dispersion relations are usually used to analyse the scattering data. [...]</description><creator>Kao, Chun-Ning.</creator><contributor>Morris, T.

As the testing methods employed gave only an incomplete picture of the factors involved in the sorption process a more detailed study seemed desirable. The problem has been treated in three distinct stages. The first of these consisted of an examination of the preparation and properties of cyanogen chloride with particular attention to the probable traces of impurities that might poison the catalytic impregnants. A rapid method of checking the purity was sought, as well as a knowledge of the physical and chemical behavior. The second stage consisted of measuring the rate of hydrolysis of cyanogen chloride in aqueous solutions since hydrolysis was considered likely to be an important factor in the destruction of the gas on charcoal. The third stage was devoted to sorption measurements under a variety of conditions. In view of these rather distinct subdivisions of the investigation, the data have been presented in the chronological order. Each section is presented separately, and includes the relevant historical and theoretical matter pertaining to the experimental work contained therein.
