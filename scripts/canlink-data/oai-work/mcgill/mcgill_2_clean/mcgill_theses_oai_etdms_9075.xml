The synthesis of tosyl esters from tosyl chloride has been extended to certain aryl-alkyl primary alcohols.2. Sodium iodide in acetone solution at room temperature replaces the tosyl groups in the toayl esters from arylalkyl primary alcohols with iodine,and with the same ease as with tosyl esters from primary alkyl alcohols.3. With secondary alkyl tosyl esters, replacement of the tosyl group by iodine takes place to a much smaller extent under the same experimentalconditions, namely, at room temperature.4. Interaction of sodium iodide and the tosyl esters of alk-aryl secondary alcohols, for example, benzhydrol, proceeds abnormally. In the case ofbenzhydrol, the reaction product is dibenzhydryl ether.5. Freudenbergts conclusions, that tertiary alcohols do not readily yield tosyl esters, have been confirmed.6.

The results, together with thosefor the other members of the nitrite series, are discussed from the point of view of the Kassel theory. Attention is focussed particularly on theeffect of increasing molecular complexity as one ascends an homologous series, since the nitrites form an ideal series for such a discussion.The Kassel theory apparently furnishes a complete explanation of the facts insofar as the effect of pressure on the rates is concerned. On theother hand, there is no satisfactory quantitative explanation for the increase in the high pressure rate with increasing molecular complexity.The factors which might contribute to such an increase are discussed, and it is concluded that the main factor is probably a progressivechange in binding energy as one ascends the homologous series.</description><creator>Katz, Sidney.</creator><contributor>Steacie, E.

The properties of the peroxide and of its aqueous solutions have been under investigation in these laboratories for some time.The work to be described herein will deal quite fully with the electrical conductivity of nitric acid, and somewhat briefly with that of sulphuricacid in aqueous hydrogen peroxide. These electrolytes represent the strong, inorganic acids and will be compared with organic acids and inorganicsalts whose conductivity in aqueous peroxide has already been investigated.Such a study is also of interest from the viewpoint of the nitric acid. Almost no work has been done on its conductivity in any medium other thanwater. [...]</description><creator>MacLauchlan, Donald Wells.</creator><contributor>Hatcher, W.

The bean mosaic virus invades the embryo of the garden bean and is transmitted to the seedling.It has been determined that the phenomenon -of seed transmission of a virus cannot be explained on a basis of a continuity of plasmodesmata frommaternal to embryonic tissues. Such continuity was not found in either the bean which transmits the virus by seed or the tobacco which apparentlydoes not.Evidence is presented that the tobacco virus is not transmitted through pollen to the seed. Also pollen of diseased bean and tobacco plants wasfound non-infective.A hot-water treatment to free infected bean seed from mosaic virus is presented.</description><creator>McEvoy, Edward Thomas.</creator><contributor>Brodie, H.

Measurements previously carried out in this laboratory with this end in viewhave dealt with the isothermals of water and other vapours on cellulose (1, 2, 3, 4), with the densities (5), the alkali adsorption (6, 7), the heatconductivity (8), the dielectric constant (9, 10), the rates of adsorption (11) and the heats of wetting and water vapour adsorption (12) of suchsystems.

Stark effect in the spectrum of DQ has been observed under high dispersion in the spectral range 6500 - 5700 A at a field strength of 69 Kv/cm.2. Measurements of the Stark effect are reported for 173 lines of which 79 are classified Fulcher band lines, the remainder being as yetunclassified.3. The wave-lengths of the unclassified lines have been determined with an accuracy In most cases of better than 0.1 A.4. The Stark effect is of the same order of magnitude and of the same general nature as in H2. Most of the lines exhibit small simple displacements.In a number of cases two components are observed in each polarization.5. The theory of the Stark effect is discussed, and compared qualitatively with the experimental results.6. Partial agreement is found with the results of the only former observer whose investigation under low dispersion was restricted to the classifiedFulcher bands in this region.7. The Stark effect data for the unclassified lines should be of some value for their classification.</description><creator>Neamtan, Samuel M.</creator><contributor>Foster, J.

That it is necessary for normal plant growth and wellbeing is evident from the chlorosis which develops in plants grown in soils ornutrient solutions deficient in iron. Although the iron is not present in the pigment itself, that it must be in some way related to it physiologicallywas emphasized by Moore (1), who assigned to iron some function in the photosynthesis of chlorophyll.
