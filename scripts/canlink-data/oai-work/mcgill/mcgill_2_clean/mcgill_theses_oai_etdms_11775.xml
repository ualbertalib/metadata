Enzymatic hydrolysis is slow and incomplete, alkalis racemize the optically active amino acids and destroy cystine and arginine, and acid hydrolysis is accompanied by humin formation and tryptophane destruction. The destruction of tryptophane during acid hydrolysis is not, in all cases, due to the direct action of the acid since pure tryptophane is relatively stable in hot dilute sulphuric and hydrochloric acids. The destruction must, therefore, be due to some other constituent or constituents of the protein. Consequently, there is some reasonable prospect that tryptophane destruction can be avoided if the harmful effects of these other agents can be eliminated.

As the metabolism of these substances is still poorly understood, the tracer technique should become a very useful tool to elucidate the pathways of the steroid hormones in the animal organism.

The main idea has been to open one of the rings in the steroid nucleus, introduce an isotopic carbon atom and regenerate the original steroid molecule for subsequent use. Among the four rings of the steroid molecule, ring A seemed to be the most desirable for this purpose because several important hormonal steroids, namely, testosterone, progesterone and corticoid hormones, possess a common ^3 unsaturated ketone group in ring A; thus a general method of labelling these steroids was sought.[...]</description><creator>Prado, Eline Sant’Anna.</creator><contributor>Jamieson, R.

In these areas, where high building density prevails, the design and siting of buildings closely controls the amount of natural light which has access to them. Before the advent of elevators, the height of buildings was fairly limited by various practical considerations, such as, the number of flights of stairs which people could reasonably be expected to climb.[...]</description><creator>Papanek, R.</creator><contributor>Spencer-Sales, H.

Although most of the fighting took place in Africa the real importance of the war lay in its effect upon European politics. Because of Italy's naval superiority the Turkish forces in Africa could not be reinforced, with the result that the two opponents could not actually come to grips with one another. It became a war which was at once half European and half colonial, and one in which no decisive battle could be fought between the belligerents. The question posed by this war was not who would possess Tripoli, but rather, what would the effect of the war be upon Italy, upon Turkey, and upon European politics in general.

It is the approach to an ideal, to an absolute end which exists of its own right. It does not offer a system in which all the component ideas are located in a specific place, and it does not force us to study these separately and then bring them together into an artificial whole. We can consider Plato's Philosophy from different points of view: his Ethics, his Epistemology, or his Politics, but every one of these points of view is so concerned and intermingled with the rest that an isolation of one of them is, strictly speacking, impossible.

The diet consisted mainly of whole wheat. As fed, it was found to be unsuitable for digestibility studies with guinea pigs. With sheep, a basal hay diet was fed and digestion coefficients determined indirectly. Variability between individuals was relatively low, for all species, for food fractions other than crude fiber and ether extract. Humans digested crude fiber to the same extent as pigs and rata. The range of the digestion coefficients for crude protein, nitrogen-free extract and digestible energy was remarkably small, considering that the species used in this study had anatomically different digestive systems. All species showed significant differences in the total digestible nutrients and digestible energy of the diet. Further research is needed in comparative species digestibility studies with humans.</description><creator>Neilson, Helen Ridout.</creator><contributor>Crampton, E.

The work was performed in the Departments of Experimental Surgery and Physiology at McGill University. In Chapter I, a description is given of a new method of preparing dogs for the study of metabolism. As will be pointed out, such preparations need not be restricted to this study but can be used to investigate several other problems. A review of the literature dealing with the bronchial vessels, as outlined in Chapter 2, emphasizes their importance to the physiology of respiration. It was felt, therefore, that it would be interesting to attempt to obliterate this vascular supply to one lung in dogs and to study the effect histologically.

Particular reference is made to the relative ages of these formations* their structures, and to major faults. The field evidence suggests that a red feldsparporphyry intrusive is younger than the granite which intrudes the volcanic porphyries. This, and to some extent the stratigraphic sequence proposed differ from previous findings. The distribution and attitudes of the sedimentary and volcanic formations indicate a flexure in a regional northv/esterly-trending open fold- Two sets of right-hand faults strike northerly and northeasterly respectively. The latter are marked by large displacements and in places by giant quartz veins. The horizontal movement along one such northeasterly-trending fault is determined as three to four miles. The age relations and causes of faulting are discussed.</description><creator>Mulligan, Robert.</creator><contributor>Jolliffe, A.
