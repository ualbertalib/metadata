This notion is the real unifying principle that indisputably confers its penetrating unity to the book. If the kind of dialogue favoured by the Queen creates a polyphony which, at first, may seem destabilizing and hinder the coherence of the book, after reading it carefully, however, one notices that a certain number of guidelines relating to the notion of honour permeate the book. By identifying systems and ensembles, one discovers different sets of correlations--in connection with the notion of honour, that are connected by intelligible links and form homogeneous units that are completely meaningful. This reveals that, behind the obvious conservatism of the characters and members of the storyteller circle of Heptameron, the bivalence of the honour code, in the relationships between men and women, is challenged, even criticized.</description><creator>Mondor, Lyne</creator><contributor>Desrosiers-Bonin, Diane (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Marguerite, Queen, consort of Henry II, King of Navarre, 1492-1549.

The work disclosed a contrapuntal tension between its fundamental structural-harmonic organization, which is based on an incomplete harmonic progression (V7-I), and its more remote intermediary tonal areas, which Brahms implies throughout the Intermezzo but to which he never wholly commits. The aim of this investigation is to illustrate how tonal ambiguity is achieved though recurrent "incompletions" of the expected (or at least the more likely) harmonic progressions. The thesis undertakes a detailed study of Brahms' Intermezzo, Op. 76, no. 4, in B-flat major, with additional reference to the openings of Opp. 118, no. 1 (A minor); 118, no. 6 (E-flat minor); 119, no. 1 (B minor); 117, no. 2 (B-flat minor) and 76, no. 8 (C major). The study combines a Schenkerian linear-reductive approach with observations based on phenomenology--after Leonard Meyer and David Lewin--and narrative, after Edward T.

His theory of maslahah is not confined only to cases which have no textual basis but is also applied to those problems that come within the purview of the revealed texts. His theory of maslahah is, no doubt, unique and original. He prefers to place maslahah above all legal sources, including the Qur'an and the Hadith which, according to him, cannot lead people to uniform rulings. He believes that only with this theory can human welfare be secured. Due to its unique and controversial nature, al-Tufi's theory of maslahah was not welcomed and even received severe criticism from other jurists. Indeed, this theory went beyond al-Tufis times and was much later seen as suitable for anticipating social change. Therefore, in modern times, in which law reform is needed his theory of maslahah receives serious attention. This thesis also attempts to argue that, even though their concept of maslahah is not as liberal as that of al-Tufi the modern reformists' theory of maslahah is, by and large, inspired and even influenced by al-Tufis maslahah.</description><creator>Lubis, Nazly Hanum</creator><contributor>Hallaq, Wael B.

In the rapidly changing social context, private education reemerged along with the development of the market economy. Recently, elite private education has caught wide attention in both China and overseas. This research adopts a case study approach to examine the development of private schools in China. This research is based on an elite private school in Beijing, where the researcher stayed for two weeks in order to collect data. Interviews and observations were conducted and documents were collected focusing on: (1) The background of re-emergence of private schools; (2) Characteristics of the private elite school; (3) The influence of sociopolitical factors on the school's operation and functioning. This case study provides insight into the present development of private elite education in China, and discusses the implications for educational purpose, quality, and equality.</description><creator>Liu, Yufeng, 1962-</creator><contributor>Lin, Jing (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Education -- China</subject><subject>Private schools -- China</subject><title>Private elite education in the People's Republic of China : a case study of Jinghua Private School</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pn89d8632.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q811km714</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Administration and Policy Studies in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0v838259f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:04:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Abstract Not Available.</description><creator>Lanir, Shoshana</creator><contributor>Levy, B.

Wolf's Cassandra can be interpreted as a utopian projection. It is an expression of Wolf's not so modest proposal: "Literature today ought to be research on peace." Atwood examines the underside of hope. While describing the present time as alarming, she speculates about the future. Juxtaposing the two novels provides a view of the political and philosophical imagination of the two authors. The cultural critique is esthetically expanded through the perspective of the protagonists. Both novels can be viewed as archeological work from a female perspective, as they attempt to provide a new vision by uncovering the blind spots of our western socio-political history.</description><creator>Laine-Wille, Ilona</creator><date>1995</date><subject>Atwood, Margaret, 1939- Handmaid's tale</subject><subject>Wolf, Christa.

Overturning the hitherto dismissive and/or reductive critiques of her lesser-known works, this thesis challenges negative assessments by reinterpreting the structure of Shelley's fiction. Concentrating particularly on the early Frankenstein(1818), Mathilda (written in 1819), and The Last Man (1826), with a focus on the use of insistent embedded quotations, this thesis begins by exploring Shelley's belief in textuality as a form of "grafting." As scholars have suggested, Shelley's literary borrowings are a result of her materialist-based views of human reality. The persistent use of embedded quotations is one way in which Shelley's fiction represents texts as collations of materials. The core of the argument posits that citational "grafting" has distinctive and striking effects in each of the works examined. In Frankenstein, quotations underscore existential alienation by pointing to the need for texts to fill in the lacunae of human understanding; in Mathilda, the narrator uses citations to create a sense of personal identity; and in The Last Man, citational excerpts are used with the assumption that they are shared pockets of meaning belonging to a community of human readers. This reconceptualization of Shelley's writing contributes to the generic taxonomies that are now being used to retheorize "the novel" in more inclusive and specific ways.</description><creator>Kibaris, Anna-Maria</creator><contributor>Hensley, David C.

The objective of the paper is to see whether by introducing fuzziness we arrive to new results or just only generalizations of classical micro-economic results. We discover that the axiom of completeness is not needed anymore. Using fuzziness will also allow us to better explain the existing gap between delimiting possible choices and making the actual choice. We also introduce the notions of a fuzzy indifference set with a measurable area. The fuzzy utility surface is also discussed. The demand curve is now 'thick'. In the producer area, the classical hypothesis that maximum profit entails maximum utility of profit is now substantially weakened when introducing fuzziness. Finally, we consider revealed preference within a fuzzy context.</description><creator>Haven, Emmanuel.</creator><date>1995</date><subject>Microeconomics -- Mathematical models</subject><subject>Fuzzy sets</subject><title>The use of fuzzy set theory in economics : applications in micro-economics and finance</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zw12z745r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n009w445j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Economics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:dz010s23j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:04:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The thesis synthesises current water utility practice, and economic theory, through the development of a practical water rate based on marginal cost pricing. The suggested water rate is a three part tariff consisting of volumetric, connection and access charges. The volumetric charges recover the long run marginal costs associated with water demand, and include peak and off-peak prices. They are calculated using an extension to the Turvey concept of long run marginal cost. The connection charges represent the marginal costs associated with connecting to the system, rather than those associated with water demand. They are of two types: those related to the local distribution network, and those related to annual operating costs. An access charge is also suggested as a means of recovering residual common costs associated with economies of scale related to production. The proposed water rate, while based primarily on possible welfare improvements, also promises gains in simplicity in use and rate stability over time, compared to current practice.</description><creator>Harris, Jeff, 1959-</creator><contributor>Cairns, Robert (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Green, Christopher (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Waterworks -- Costs</subject><title>A practical method for setting water rates</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fn107105n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dz010s23j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Economics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zs25xb59v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:04:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The government of Quebec has officially opposed federal multicultural policy since 1971. Although the provincial response to multiculturalism, now widely known as interculturalisme, began to take shape as of the early 1980s, ethnic minorities in the province continue to be served by distinct federal and provincial bureaucracies. Despite this, federal-provincial relations over ethnic policy in Quebec remain little studied. Provincial rhetoric and many theoretical writings on intergovernmental relations in Canada together give rise to expectations of competition or conflict. However, some specialists in the field warn against overlooking collaboration. In fact, original research undertaken to explore federal-provincial relations in this sensitive policy area produced evidence of collaboration between federal and provincial officials despite divergences of opinion both political and theoretical. In addition, a certain degree of complementarity was noted in federal and provincial funding of ethnocultural and community groups.</description><creator>Hagen, David, 1962-</creator><contributor>Black, Jerome (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Federal government -- Québec (Province)</subject><subject>Federal government -- Canada.</subject><subject>Québec (Province) -- Ethnic relations</subject><title>So many agendas : federal-provincial relations in the ethnic policy field in Quebec</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1v53k013p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zs25xb59v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x920fz79z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:04:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis explores the cultural implications underlying the medical practice of cutting human flesh. The examination focuses, in particular, on the function of representational technologies--from anatomy sketches to computer imaging--in the scientific understanding of the body in the West. By foregrounding the technologies of representation which inform and have directed a history of surgery, it is hoped that the cultural aspects of modern medicine will be made apparent. This thesis argues that while science benefitted from art to construct its image of 'the' body, it has had to rid itself of art in order to justify its empirical claims. The study concludes with a discussion of the work of the French performance artist Orlan who uses plastic surgery in a performative setting to deconstruct these very claims.</description><creator>Futterer, Patricia</creator><contributor>Morchessault, Janine (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Surgery, Plastic -- Social aspects.</subject><subject>Imaging systems in medicine -- History.</subject><subject>Imaging systems in medicine -- Social aspects.</subject><subject>Surgery -- History.</subject><subject>Body image -- Social aspects.</subject><title>Cultural studies of science : skinning bodies in Western medicine</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6m311r45z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x920fz79z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Graduate Communications Program</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8p58pg04q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:04:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Schoenberg's monodrama Erwartung, op.17 (1909), appeared at the dawn of early Expressionism, a movement which profoundly affected the composer's early works. This movement dealt in part with the alienation and isolation of the self in what many artists considered a corrupt and degenerate society. The first part of this thesis examines the possible influences of the Expressionist and Symbolist traditions on Erwartung's text and, to a lesser extent, the early history of psychoanalysis, of which librettist Marie Pappenheim was certainly aware. The impact of the changes made by Schoenberg to Pappenheim's original text, as well as some of his elusive stage directions are given consideration. The composer and librettist created a text which effectively obscures the boundaries between the protagonist's conscious and unconscious thoughts, hence confusing the audience's perception of perception of reality and illusion. Schoenberg parallels this dramatic disjunction in his music, as is discussed in the second part of the paper. Certain representational moments (for example, pitch cells and ostinati) are presented; the musical context of these moments is radically changed in subsequent appearances, preventing them from being audibly recognizable, and from retaining a stable meaning. This discussion refutes earlier analyses of Erwartung which stress so-called motivic and thematic connections. Several illustrative moments in Scene IV are highlighted. Although on a local level, certain musical connections exist, what remains most disturbing and thus most effective in Erwartung is how the separateness of these 'climactic' moments gives the work its disjunct and temporally unpredictable quality.</description><creator>Feilotter, Melanie</creator><contributor>Cherney, Brian (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Schoenberg, Arnold, 1874-1951.

Plantinga indeed calls into question any confident presumption that theistic belief is epistemically irresponsible. He not only seriously challenges the necessity for propositional evidence to be available for such belief to be justified, he also supplies significant support for the conclusion that it remains legitimate even if it faces a preponderance of contrary considerations. However, Plantinga does not convincingly demonstrate that basic theistic belief merits privileged status by virtue of a character sufficiently analogous to paradigmatic perceptual, memory and ascriptive beliefs. Nor does he adequately argue its independence from the bearing of evidentialist concerns, especially regarding its background moorings. He needs to do more work to show the full warrant for theistic belief.</description><creator>Dyck, Timothy Lee</creator><contributor>Boutin, Maurice (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>God -- Proof -- History of doctrines -- 20th century</subject><subject>Faith and reason -- Christianity -- History of doctrines -- 20th century.</subject><subject>Plantinga, Alvin</subject><title>Proper basicality for belief in God : Alvin Plantinga and the evidentialist objection to theism</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/db78tf08z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h128ng77p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Religious Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0k225d06n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:04:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In the history of modern Iran, religion and nationalism often converge to bring about social and political change. The people of the bazaar and the religious leaders, who consistently supported each other on many important occasions, joined forces with the intelligensia to bring about change. This alliance was dissolved after the accomplishment of the original goal. This configuration came into existence during the Constitutional Revolution of 1906 and at the time of the movement to nationalize the oil industry. During 1951-1953, under the umbrella of the National Front, the intelligensia, led by Dr. Muhammad Musaddiq, along with the merchants and religious leaders under Ayatullah Kashani, formed an alliance to implement nationalist economic policies. In this instance, too, the alliance did not last long, especially as it threatened the interests of the major powers.</description><creator>Derayeh, Minoo</creator><contributor>Turgay, A.

Responses to Vulnerability were coded and content analyzed. Sex differences were examined to explore whether girls display more responses to Vulnerability than boys and whether girls and boys differ in Responses to Vulnerability in their play. No sex differences were found in amount of time responding to Vulnerability; however, some support was found for sex differences in types of Responses to Vulnerability. Experiment 2 experimentally examined girls' and boys' preferences for vignettes representing Categories of Response to the same Vulnerability Situation: Dominant Mastery, Nurturant Mastery, and Sharing Problems. Preferences for two Vulnerability Situations were examined. Boys were expected to show a preference for Dominant Mastery responses and girls a preference for Sharing Problems as well as Nurturant Mastery responses. Several marginally significant results were found. Discussion focuses on adult consequences and implications for later male and female interactions.</description><creator>Del Bianco, Réjeanne</creator><contributor>Benenson, Joyce (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Fear in children</subject><subject>Sex differences (Psychology) in children</subject><title>Sex differences in children's play : boys' and girls' responses to vulnerability</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5x21th52c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4m90dx484</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:dz010s24t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:04:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A growing body of both substantive and theoretical literature suggests that educational underachievement among certain ethnic groups is due to the cultural discontinuity between mainstream education and minority students. A pedagogy that both uses and reinforces the culture of ethnic minority students, implemented by ethnically similar teachers, is therefore thought to contribute to a more constructive school experience and strengthen the social and political status of the ethnic community as a whole. For this thesis, a group of Haitian educators working in Montreal area schools was interviewed to investigate the extent to which this approach is viewed as a potential solution to the low academic achievement of numerous Haitian students. Some evidence was found that culturally congruent education is, according to the experiences of some of the respondents, a potentially beneficial strategy to curtail educational inequality. In was generally argued, however, that this should be a limited, remedial strategy with little bearing on the communal survival of the Haitian community.</description><creator>Couton, Philippe</creator><contributor>Weinfeld, M.

Peer relationship measures included sociometric measures such as peer ratings and sociograms and observational measures such as coordinated group activity and dyadic interaction. Spearman rank correlation coefficients were obtained. Peer ratings shared high correlations with cognitive variables such as I.Q., for the middle mental age class. Behavioral variables were correlated to peer ratings for the middle and the highest mental age classes. Dyadic interaction variables were correlated to peer ratings for the lowest and the middle mental age classes.

At first imperceptible, it is soon revealed through the movement of wind or water. If the light in movement gives form to the landscape by outlining the contour of things, the fixed light, on the other hand, hollows out large holes of darkness which engulf the landscape. The space thus displayed reduces the poet to anonymity and silence. The conflict pulling the poet between these two forms of light, which refers to the problematics of Orpheus' song and sight, as defined by Blanchot, constitutes the drama of Saint-Denys Garneau. The poet thus seems to rest only in the midst of the transparence, this excess of clarity which transfigures things without however destroying their unchanging appearance. Light thus determines the poet's attitude facing the world. Each day is lived out according to the ascent or decline of light. One can thus observe how the morning, afternoon and night inspire in Saint-Denys Garneau particular states of mind and songs. Light is indissociable from Saint-Denys Garneau's poetic process. This study should allow me to show that the poet's failure is not exclusively the result of exterior hostile forces acting upon his poetic undertaking, but that it places itself, on the contrary, within this poetic undertaking insofar as the silence (the darkness of the fixed light) is the necessary risk to the word (the light in movement).</description><creator>Caron, Katerine</creator><contributor>Rivard, Yvon (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Light and darkness in literature</subject><subject>Garneau, Saint-Denys, 1912-1943 -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><title>La lumière dans la poésie de Saint-Denys Garneau</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t722hb91w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zc77sr989</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:00000214r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:05:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>After having reached a level of influence unmatched by any other element of Soviet government under Stalin and Beria, the security organs of the Soviet Union proved difficult to tame. While it has been argued that the KGB was made subservient to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union after the ascent of Khrushchev in the late 1950's, this essay will attempt to show that the security police apparatus was able to maintain a high level of prominence and even autonomy throughout the history of the Soviet Union and beyond. While it may have appeared that the organs were under constraints during periods of unchallenged leadership, the lack of a legislative definition of the KGB's role made the possibility of a coup or putsch a constant threat. During periods of instability, particularly those surrounding the succession struggles, the KGB was able to act independently and was highly influential as to the outcome of these contests. In the latter years of the Soviet era, efforts to alter the system in order to avoid the excesses of previous years revealed the organs to be highly adaptable and cognizant of the need to change to avoid being excluded from the political decision-making process. Through an assessment of the various succession struggles and efforts to place the organs within the confines of legality, the political power of the KGB may be better understood, and placed in a historical perspective side by side with its post-Soviet counterpart, which too is shown to have survived recent upheavals.</description><creator>Bennett, Jeffrey D.</creator><contributor>Boss, V.

The re-evaluation proceeds from a contextual interpretation of Niebuhr's theology in general and a contextual reading of his doctrine of sin in particular. My argument is that Niebuhr is deliberately and consistently a contextual theologian. I locate his contextual methodology in the open-ended approach of Christian realism. The feminist critique is based on the assumption that Niebuhr universally defines the primary sin as pride. It is argued that pride is in fact a distinctly male characteristic, and, while quite plausibly the primary sin for men, is clearly not the primary sin for women. Niebuhr is guilty, that is, of confusing male reality with human reality in the doctrine. Saiving and Plaskow then develop a definition of women's sin which they correspond with Niebuhr's sin of sensuality. This type of sin, rather than being self-aggrandizing, is characterized by inordinate and destructive self-effacement. Their subsidiary argument is that Niebuhr erroneously treats sensuality, which should be equal but opposite to pride, as a secondary form of sin. My argument in this thesis is that the critique rests on a mistaken assumption about the universality of Niebuhr's claim. His concerns were with the powerful. The contextual claim that pride is the primary form of sin in those who are empowered is being mistaken for a claim that pride is the primary sin for all people, regardless of gender or context. My subsidiary argument is that the correlation of women's sin with Niebuhr's understanding of sensuality is mistaken. What the feminists refer to as women's sin is in fact not sin at all for Niebuhr but evidence of injustice. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)</description><creator>Baichwal, J. S.

The complexity of FPGAs makes manual designs time consuming and error prone; design automation tools are essential to the effective use of FPGAs. Routing is one part of the design process of VLSI chips that is computational complex and hence very time consuming. The arrival of the interior-point method proposed by N. Karmarkar was an important event in linear programming and several variants have been developed since then. Recent experiments in a variety of areas report that Karmarkar's algorithm performs asymptotically faster than the traditional simplex method and is competitive with simulated annealing. In this thesis, a global router for symmetrical FPGAs is implemented based on the dual-affine variant of Karmarkar's interior-point method. Current approaches in VLSI global routing, the model of symmetrical FPGAs and the formulation of the global-routing problem as a mixed-integer linear program are reviewed. The objective of the global router is to find a routing that balances the channel-segment densities in the symmetrical FPGA. Specific implementation details are covered in depth and experimental results for samples of random global-routing problems are reported.</description><creator>Buhescu, Razvan Mihai</creator><contributor>Szymanski, Ted (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Engineering, System Science.</subject><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Implementation of a global router for symmetrical FPGAs based on the dual-affine variant of Karmarkar's interior-point method</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2b88qf06n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z603r047g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8s45qb87h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:05:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In the fantastical world of the Architecture Civile, Jean-Jacques Lequeu (1757-1826) designed the architect's space of appearance across a ritual act of representation. The meticulous crafting of the architectural drawing defined the very site upon which his highly syncretic and imaginative ornamental language was developed. It was in the idea of ornament that Lequeu articulated his veneration of, and dedication to the restoration of, architectural beauty and delight. In the drawing and writing of the orthograph(i)e, Lequeu enacted the promordial trait of the dessinateur to found his art and science of representation. In the shadowed depths of the surface and its edge, the elevation and its section, the portrait and its profile, the figural ornaments of Nature and Architecture were made to appear. These, the principal characteristics of his architectural language, were expressed across all three scales of being: the cosmic-sacred, the mythic-historic, and the poetic-psychic. Lequeu's allegorical and symbolic narratives sought to reveal the problematic relationship that existed between architectural thought and its representation, at the threshold of modernity.</description><creator>Trubiano, Franca</creator><contributor>Perez-Gomez, Alberto (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Lequeu, Jean-Jacques, 1757-ca. 1825 -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><title>Jean-Jacques Lequeu, orthograph(i)e and the ritual drawing of l'architecture civile</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/41687k28b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8s45qb87h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6969z301d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:05:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>How and why the scale of streets and squares has evolved from intimate and human settings to the contemporary neglect of human needs in open space is the focus of investigation in this research. An understanding of the concept of "human scale" establishes the variables that characterize humanly-scaled open space, which in turn identify transformations in the urban environment. In addition, the origins and development of zoning regulations help to trace the factors that degrade urban space and influence the loss of human scale. This loss has been identified in the adaptation of pre-industrial urban space to the novelties of technological and industrial expansion. The complexity of solutions to such issues as traffic congestion, the urgent need for new housing accommodation, overcrowding and hygienic problems influenced the new regulations that directly altered human scale through changes in street dimensions, land use patterns and size of houses and lots. In post-WW II developments these regulations became the single design tool and they greatly impeded the establishment of human scale. Recent changes in urban design practice and the reintroduction of human scale to the design of open space are not only a demonstration of increasing sensitivity towards aesthetic qualities but also a product of the new socio-economic and environmental climate. Through analysis of compositional laws and the planning practice of different Montreal residential neighborhoods over the last hundred years the author demonstrates how visual quality and human scale are the product of a complex series of socio-economic, technical and political issues.</description><creator>Lucic, Katija</creator><contributor>Friedman, Avi (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>City planning -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</subject><subject>Architecture -- Human factors -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</subject><title>Human scale in the urban design of Montreal residential developments</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b8515q56m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6969z301d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):1225</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
