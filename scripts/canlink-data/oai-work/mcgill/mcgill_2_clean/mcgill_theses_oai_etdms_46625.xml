According to the 1931 International Year Book, 24.4 per cent of the total land area in twenty-six countries of the world, were classed as pasture in 1930 (Table I, Appendix). This area in pasture was 1.6 times the area of the total arable land. Great Britain had the highest and Australia the lowest percentage of the total area in pasture, having 56.8 and 0.3 per cent respectively.

The mediaeval religious drama and the few plays which had precededthe classical plays were not definitely classified as tragedy. Renaissance and pseudo-classical theorists turned to Aristotle's "Poetics" for rules governing tragedy. The "Poetics" may be the fragmentary notes of one of Aristotle's pupils, jotted down as he listened to his master in the shady walks of the Lyceum. Aristotle's method was analytical; he studied plays and gave his opinion as to their principal characteristics. [...]</description><creator>Montgomery, Harriet Rose.</creator><contributor>Files, H.

Thus, on the one hand it is likely that the action of small amounts of sulphurous aoid play an important role with respect to the permanence of "paper" (lA), while on the other hand, the behavior of cellulose (in the form of sulphite pulp) towards sulphurous aoid, under varying conditions of temperature, time and concentration are as yet unknown, although such knowledge is of very great importance to the manufacture of sulphite pulp. In the preparation of the latter material, the wood chips are heated with solutions of sulphurous acid, containing calcium and magnesium bisulphites to remove the lignin.

The crude product, on purification by precipitation from dioxan into ether was separated into two homogeneous fractions, Alkali Lignin A, insoluble in dioxan-ether, and Alkali Lignin B, soluble in dioxan-ether. Alkali Lignin A condensed with both 0- and p-bromphenol to form the corresponding substituted phenyl ethers, which gave identical analyses. On the basis of the bromine content of these condensation products, Alkali Lignin A corresponds to the empirical formula C67H7l023 (m.w.= 1244), and contains, as shown from the analyses of its acetylated and methylated derivatives, 6 methoxyl groups, 3 phenolic, and 4 aliphatic hydroxyl groups. Alkali Lignin A also condensed with two molecules of phenol, one in ether condensation, the other in nuclear condensation. This Phenol Alkali Lignin A has an empirical formula C79HSI024, and contains 6 methoxyl groups, 6 phenolic and 3 aliphatic hydroxyl groups, as likewise shown from its derivatives. The absence of carbonyl groups in both Alkali Lignin A and Phenol Alkali Lignin A was shown by the inability of the fully meLhylated derivatives to form methyl esters with diazomethane. On treatment with MeOH-HC1, tne methoxyl content of Alkali Lignin A increased by an amount corresponding to the introduction of two methoxyl groups. The smallest building unit for Alkali Lignin B corresponds to the formula CIOgHl07037, with a m.w. of 1996 and containing 9 methoxyl groups, g phenolic, and 3 aliphatic hydroxyl groups.

Some of the different characteristics on which phylogenetic systems have been based are considered. The subject of chromosome morphology is discussed in detail, and the application of idiograms and karyetypes to taxonomic studies is explained. The main purpose of the present study was to scrutinize and extend the findings of Avdulov who has recently published a monograph in which extensive changes, based on karyological studies, have been made in the classification of the Gramineae. Taking the grasses in order by tribes, Avdulov's results are summarized, to them are added the results of an original investigation of thirty-three species belonging to twenty-nine genera from ten tribes, and also new results from other workers. The evolution of different forms within the family is touched upon. [...]</description><creator>Hunter, A. W. S.</creator><contributor>Huskins, C.

Unless the steel beams are haunched the bond between the steel and the concrete has a low, uncertain value. In designing steel beams where a concrete slab merely rests upon them, the beams have to carry the dead load due to their own weight and the weight of the slab, plus the live load and impact without any assistance from the slab. If the bond between the slab and the supporting beams had a high, dependable value, the slab and beams could be assumed to be a structural unit capable of supporting greater loads than if acting independently. The concrete slab would provide an excellent compression flange and the bottom flange of the beam would be more effective due to the increased distance to the top flange. The object to this research is to test the degree of structural unity between a concrete slab and a steel beam with four different types of plates welded to the top flange of the beam and from the data obtained evolve a rational method of designing composite structures.</description><creator>Kirk, William Douglas</creator><contributor>Jamieson, R.

We might accept them in their entirety without suspicion or caution, or again we might assume an attitude of incredulity. Did Juvenal really rage within his heart at the vices of the world, or was he an embittered poet with singular rhetorical powers? Was Persius actually downcast at man's apparent lack of reason and morality, or was he simply voicing his preceptor's axioms? And finally, could Horace possibly justify his attacks on the grounds of self-defense, or was he laughing at man 9nly to cut and wound all the more deeply? To clarify these pertinent questions, we must inquireinto what innate rights these Romans possessed to criticize their fellow-men.

Precision measurements of the specific heats and latent heat of fusion of deuterium oxide are not only interesting in themselves but they may give some clue as to the degree of association of the molecules in the liquid state both of deuterium oxide and of ordinary water. For convenience of presentation this thesis is divided into two main sections each complete in itself with its own disoussion, index, and bibliography. A brief discussion of adiabatic calorimetry is given in the introduction. Section I deals with the determination of some thermal properties of deuterium oxide and is divided into two parts. Part I deals with the specific heats of the solid and the latent heat of fusion. Part II contains the determination of the specific heat of the liquid in a smaller calorimeter. In Section II a full description of the design and method of operation of the new calorimeter is given. This section also presents further results on the specific heats of the liquid deuterium oxide. A general discussion and summary conclude the thesis.</description><creator>Brown, Robert Stewart</creator><contributor>Barnes, W. (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Maas, O.
