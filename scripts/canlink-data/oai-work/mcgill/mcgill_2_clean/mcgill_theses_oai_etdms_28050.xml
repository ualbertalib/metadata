Restriction fragment length polymorphism and microsatellite size variation analyses were employed to follow the segregation of Sp in relation to eight or ten loci previously assigned to the proximal portion of mouse chromosome 1. Although results from an interspecific ((Sp/+ x Mus spretus)F1-Sp x C57BL/6J) backcross study were inconclusive, a panel of 125 intraspecific ((Sp/+ x CBA/J)F1-Sp x CBA/J) backcross mice positioned the Sp gene 0.8 $ pm$ 0.8 centiMorgans distal to the Vil/Des/Inha loci and detected no recombinant between the mutant allele and the murine paired box gene, Pax-3, positioning this locus within 2.9 centiMorgans of Sp (95% confidence limits). Concurrent research has identified alterations in Pax-3 in several Sp allelic variants; thus, this study provides additional genetic evidence in support of the candidacy of Pax-3 for the Sp locus. Effects of genetic background on the penetrance and expression of Sp were also observed.</description><creator>Mancino, Franca</creator><contributor>Trasler, D. G.

The first part of the thesis deals with the years of learning when protagonists gradually discover love's hardships. It's through their pangs and suffering that each one of them will become aware of his or her place in society. In the second part devoted to young couples will appear the progressive awareness, painful though necessary, that the partner is hopelessly a stranger. The last part studies the differences in behavioral patterns of men and women in the life of the couple. With Colette the man regresses and sinks where the woman draws strength from revolt and learns solidarity in womanhood and how to go beyond herself. In Colette's feminine universe jealousy is then a positive element encompassing self awareness and mastery over oneself enabling thus through careful and appropriate use a renewal of the feeling of love.</description><creator>Goudin-Desphelippon, Laurence</creator><contributor>Duquette, Jean-Pierre (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Jealousy in literature</subject><subject>Colette, 1873-1954 -- Knowledge -- Jealousy</subject><title>Du bon usage de la jalousie dans quatre romans de Colette</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20st896.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mc87pr536</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gb19f7138</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:02:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Practical computational techniques are described to determine the Galois group of a degree 8 polynomial over a function field of the form Q($t sb1$, ...,$t sb{r}$).

Part One surveys four existing fast track models from the literature. In tournament theory, fast tracks have been viewed as a response to the adverse selection problem. In models where the firm uses junior positions for on-the-job screening, they may be a possibility permitted by a particular technology. Alternatively, they may arise from the signalling engaged in by workers when there is asymmetric information. Finally, they can be used as a way of overcoming a lack of precise information on worker ability. In the second part of the thesis an alternative explanation is proposed. A firm is considered to consist of two levels: production workers and managerial workers. If a worker is an able manager, the firm will lose valuable production time by slow promotion. However, slower promotion allows more information to be revealed for a given expenditure. Different track lengths are created depending on the firm's initial assessment of managerial competence.</description><creator>Goldberg, Ilfra Charlotte</creator><contributor>Hogan, Seamus (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Promotions -- Mathematical models</subject><subject>Executives -- Promotions -- Mathematical models</subject><subject>Organizational behavior -- Mathematical models</subject><title>Why is there fast-track promotion?</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kd17cv23v.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/00000127m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Economics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:r207tq55x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:02:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study presents a modular connectionist model of the development of seriation in children. The model makes use of the cascade-correlation generative algorithm. The algorithm builds its own network topology as is required to solve the task. This model develops in a stage-like manner and goes beyond the previous rule based models by successfully capturing both the variability in strategies used and the sensitivity to differences in size increments. The application of a systematic operational procedure to a subset of the elements in the series is identified as a source of empirical seriation. Finally, the model predicts that the degree of disorder of the array under construction is a significant factor in determining the observed seriating behavior. A follow-up study involving 4- to 7-year-old children finds that the degree of disorder is a significant factor in children's abilities to recognize a completed series.</description><creator>Mareschal, Denis</creator><contributor>Schultz, T.

Children's self reports on their problematic beliefs about divorce (Kurdek and Berg, 1987), self-perceived competence (Harter, 1985), and trait anxiety levels (Reynolds &amp; Richmond, 1985) were assessed. Subsequent to the intervention children had significantly fewer misconceptions about divorce, had increased perceived social acceptance, and had decreased anxiety levels.

The first was a land and agricultural policy designed to restrict competition from Africans in the produce market. The second was a labour policy addressed at the chronic labour shortages in the European mining and agricultural sectors. The third was a series of control measures seeking to impede black political organization. The goals of these policies were largely achieved by 1938 due to a combination of government initiatives and the impact of the depression. Part of this success was directly due to the effects of the depression; as economic conditions improved, Africans regained some of their economic autonomy and reasserted themselves politically.</description><creator>Thompson, Guy</creator><contributor>Echenberg, Myron (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Indigenous peoples -- Zimbabwe</subject><subject>Zimbabwe -- Social conditions -- 1890-1965</subject><title>'Native' policy in colonial Zimbabwe, 1923-1938</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9s161744h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7m01bm82j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3f462671s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:02:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Soybean leaf consumption for the most common semilooper species, Trichoplusia orichalcea (F.) was established in the laboratory using a leaf area meter. The total consumption per larva was 120,85 cm$ sp2$. The yield reduction of our soybean cultivars (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) being Duiker, Gazelle, Roan and SCS1 was measured in relation to different levels of defoliation. The defoliation was induced manually singly or sequentially over three different growth stages. At soybean maturity, counts of pods per plant, number of seeds per plant, weight per 100 seeds and weight of seeds per plant were obtained. Yields were converted to a percentage of yield and linear regressions fitted to the relationship between percentage yield and defoliation. The percentage yield was influenced by the cultivars, the levels of defoliation, and the timing of defoliation. The most critical growth stage for defoliation was the seed development stage, but the differences between them were small and not significant. SCS1 was the most resistant cultivar to defoliation, while Duiker was the most susceptible to single defoliation. The economic thresholds were determined for the soybean cultivars demonstrating significant linear relations between percentage yield and single defoliation. Based on three insecticides and two application methods, the economic thresholds were determined at the flowering stage for Duiker, at the pod development stage for Duiker and Roan and at the seed development stage for Duiker, Gazelle, Roan, and SCS1 cultivars. The numbers of semilooper caterpillars per metre of row required to reach the economic thresholds, are generally higher than the natural levels of infestation.</description><creator>Lapointe, Renée</creator><contributor>Stewart, Robin K.

This study examines the heat treatment of soybeans in a continuous particulate-medium conduction processor. Whole soybeans at 13% and 23% moisture were roasted at salt temperatures of 225, 250 and 275$ sp circ$C for residence times of 15, 30 and 60 seconds. The soybeans reached temperatures ranging from 107$ sp circ$C to 134$ sp circ$C, after which they were maintained in an insulated container for 0, 5, 10 or 15 minutes. Salt temperature, residence time, and moisture content were found to significantly affect final temperature, temperature change, moisture loss and total heat transfer. Moisture losses in the processor were very high, indicating that combining the processes of heat treatment and drying may provide a high combined efficiency. Analysis of trypsin inhibitor activity and soluble protein indicated that all three factors likely affect soybean quality, and the soybean quality achieved in these tests is likely to be sufficient for livestock feeding, although this remains to be confirmed through feeding trials.</description><creator>Tromp, Chris</creator><contributor>Raghavan, G.

In 34 choice tests, female selection of infected or uninfected males was random. Male competitive abilities was assessed by observing interactions between infected and uninfected individuals in a pen with a caged female and a single nest box. In 8 of 11 trials, uninfected males spent more time in the section closest to the female than their infected rivals, and performed more chases, attacks, and displacements than the latter. These results suggest that variation in male quality is determined in part by resistance to parasitism and can affect competition for nesting territories. Females may not have evolved mechanisms to detect parasitized males because these males are unlikely to outcompete uninfected males when territories are in limited supply.</description><creator>Henderson, Derin</creator><contributor>Bird, David M.

DNA sequencing has revealed six genes (hupABYCDE) in this region. These genes are probably transcribed in the same direction as hupSL but are probably in a different operon. Mutational analysis had shown that disruption of the hupB, hupY, hupD and hupE genes gives a Hup$ sp-$ phenotype. In the present work additional mutational analysis, using Tn5, a Tn5 -derivative containing a promoterless lacZ gene, and a kanamycin resistance gene, confirms the direction of transcription and the separate nature of the hupABYCDE operon, and extends the region known to be necessary for Hup activity to hupA and possibly to 1.6 kb upstream of hupA.</description><creator>Tito, Donald</creator><contributor>Tibelius, K.

This thesis examines the method proposed by W. B. Kleijn called prototype waveform interpolation (PWI) for coding the voiced sections of speech efficiently to achieve a coder below 4.8 kb/s while maintaining, even improving, the perceptual quality of current coders. In examining the PWI method, it was found that although the method generally works very well there are occasional sections of the reconstructed voiced speech where audible distortion can be heard, even when the prototypes are not quantized. The research undertaken in this thesis focuses on the fundamental principles behind modelling voiced speech using PWI instead of focusing on bit allocation for encoding the prototypes. Problems in the PWI method are found that may be have been overlooked as encoding error if full encoding were implemented. Kleijn uses PWI to represent voiced sections of the excitation signal which is the residual obtained after the removal of short-term redundancies by a linear predictive filter. The problem with this method is that when the PWI reconstructed excitation is passed through the inverse filter to synthesize the speech undesired effects occur due to the time-varying nature of the filter. The reconstructed speech may have undesired envelope variations which result in audible warble. This thesis proposes an energy fixup to smoothen the synthesized speech envelope when the interpolation procedure fails to provide the smooth linear result that is desired. Further investigation, however, leads to the final proposal in this thesis that PWI should he performed on the clean speech signal instead of the excitation to achieve consistently reliable results for all voiced frames.</description><creator>Leong, Michael</creator><contributor>Kabal, Peter (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Representing voiced speech using prototype waveform interpolation for low-rate speech coding</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2z10wr49k.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9s161745s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8g84mn41w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:02:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Silicone oils were microencapsulated within polyamide (nylon) membranes cross-linked with polyethylenimine. Solubility of oxygen within the silicone oils, whether encapsulated or not, was approximately 6 mM, representing solubilities 20 fold higher than that of oxygen in water. Assuming that the bioreactor volume consists of 10 to 20% microencapsulated silicone oil, this represents an enhancement of the oxygen reservoir by a factor ranging from 4 to 7. The use of 20%(v/v) microcapsule dispersions also enabled a 4 to 5 times increase of volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient (k$ sb{ rm L}$a), calculated on a per-litre aqueous phase basis, with or without the presence of cells. The improvement in oxygen transfer rates was due to the greatly increased specific surface area in comparison to conventional bubble aeration. These oxygen transfer enhancements were directly translatable into enhancements in overall productivity in a culture of Gluconobacter suboxydans (ATCC 621). The production rate of dihydroxyacetone was increased from 1.5 to 9 mM DHA/hr with the introduction of 20% of microcapsules in a batch fermentation and also from 6 to 8 mM DHA/hr in a fluidized bed fermentation. Thus, the oxygen permeable polymeric membrane coating the silicone oils as oxygen carrier should reduce the toxic or inhibitory effects previously observed in other oxygen carriers during use with live cells while providing an efficient alternative to bioreactor oxygenation with shear sensitive cell systems, or in fermentations with high oxygen requirements.</description><creator>Leung, Ricky</creator><contributor>Neufeld, R.

Ondaatje employs a variety of thematic, structural and stylistic oral narrative strategies in this inquiry. In the course of this work he faces the challenge of translating the open oral quality of the "tale" to the page. Ondaatje's longer prose works counter the printed text's tendency towards stasis through oral narrative and paralinguistic devices. Gradually, the aesthetics of public storytelling inform the process of historiographic revision. Within the oral model, ostensibly verifiable historical facts are no longer subjected to the laws of linear causality; therefore, any central single voice must relinquish its conventional claim to authority. Instead, several "speakers" tell of a shared history. Whereas conventional historiography often focuses on the effect of major historic forces, Ondaatje's oral model reveals how those on the periphery shape and define a given incident. Ultimately, the various participatory agents create the central event in the telling. The study concludes that Ondaatje employs oral narrative strategies to revise monolithic notions of history and to offer an open representation which draws attention to complexities ignored by conventional accounts.</description><creator>Gamlin, Gordon S.

It points to the advantages of incorporating the well-known Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) technique because it enables feedback control, active filtering and regulatory functions to be performed by the converters. This is because a reasonable bandwidth of the modulating signal is transmitted by the multi-converter station in spite of the low switching rates of the GTO valves.</description><creator>Kuang, Jinbo</creator><contributor>Ooi, B.

The SCF technique was shown to be a useful research tool in aromatic biodegradation studies as well as a potential pollution treatment method. Advantages of SCFs include stable and highly repeatable performance and almost complete substrate consumption. Biomass concentration, cycle time and the minimum dissolved oxygen level were monitored from cycle to cycle and the variation of these parameters during steady-state operation was less than 5%. The aromatic compounds used in this study were sodium benzoate, p-anisaldehyde and 4-methoxy-benzylidine-4-n-butylaniline (MBBA). Consumptions of 93-100% were achieved for these compounds using the SCF technique. Consumption rates of aromatic compounds were shown to be considerably higher than in conventional fermenters. Cycle time was found to be a useful parameter for comparing growth of different organisms on aromatic substrates. The cycle time was dependant on substrate concentration for p-anisaldehyde. This dependence was shown to be due to the presence of an unidentified, inhibitory intermediate. A mathematical model is presented to predict steady-state cycle times for different substrate concentrations in inhibitory cases. The uses of mixed cultures in SCFs was also examined.</description><creator>Sarkis, Bassam E.

The effects of Gender, IQ and achievement level, as well as type of program were also considered in relation to self-concept. Subjects were 85 students in grades 7 and 8 attending a large comprehensive high school, 40 of whom participated in a specialized Talented and Gifted (TAG) program. The remaining 45 were drawn from the regular school population and constituted a comparison group. Measurements included the Piers-Harris Childrens' Self-Concept scale and the Otis-Lennon Mental Ability Test. Results indicated no significant differences between groups on measures of general or social self-concept. On measures of academic self-concept, TAG students scored significantly higher than students from the regular program. With regard to gender effects, no significant differences emerged between males and females on measures of self-concept. Finally, no significant differences were determined on measures of self-concept between TAG participants scoring higher on measures of IQ and achievement and those scoring lower. Educational implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.</description><creator>Munsie, Steven D.</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Self-perception in adolescence.</subject><subject>Junior high school students</subject><title>Multi-dimensional self-concept in junior high school students : issues of gender, intelligence and program effects</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mg74qn20w.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vh53wx015</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nz8061051</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:02:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis deals with the problem of applying computer vision techniques in an underground mine environment. In particular, the problem of the localization and identification of oversized rock fragments prior to secondary breakage, following the initial drilling and blasting operation is addressed. The strategy employed is based on the methodologies developed for reconstruction and interpretation of range image data. Discrete rock pile images acquired using the NRCC/McGill laser rangefinder were used in this study. The main contribution of this thesis is the complete study of the paradigm which involves: range data acquisition, surface reconstruction, segmentation, and fitting of parametric shape models. The final representation obtained from the model, describing the spatial and geometric properties of each rock fragment and can be used to control an automated rock-breaking mechanism. To support the strategy developed, a number of experimental results at different processing stages are presented.</description><creator>Cheung, William K. W.

Our emphasis will be on interfaces that are driven far away from equilibrium with special interest in the phenomenon of kinetic roughening. Models which describe non-equilibrium interfaces will be introduced and analyzed using techniques such as the Renormalization Group, Monte Carlo simulations, and direct integration of the equation of motion. Different interface relaxation mechanisms will be discussed with a focus on surface diffusion, which is believed to be the dominant effect in Molecular Beam Epitaxy. These interface growth models generate self-affine structures with various correlations satisfying a dynamic scaling law. We compute the scaling exponents and functions. Finally, we study the effect of quenched impurities on the dynamics of a driven interface with a conservation law. The impurity effect leads to anomalous scaling exponents and qualitatively changes the interface dynamics. Our results are summarized in two articles to be published: Refs.

The strong effect of marine stratocumulus clouds on the top-of-the-atmosphere radiation budget is demonstrated using 5 years of Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) data. A relationship between albedo and sea surface temperature (SST) is shown to exist in two areas of the globe that tend to be covered by marine stratocumulus. Albedo increases when SST decreases and vice-versa in both regions when examined on an annual, interannual or spatial basis. The magnitude of the albedo response to a given SST change (1) varies within the regions; (2) differs between the two regions; (3) depends on the type of variability examined; (4) depends on the SST. No useful relations were found between albedo and other meteorological variables. Climatic implications on a global scale arising from the albedo-SST anticorrelation are also discussed.</description><creator>Oreopoulos, Lazaros</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</subject><subject>Physical Oceanography.</subject><title>Tropical marine stratocumulus albedo and its relation to sea surface temperature</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4q77fs59z.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qb98mg772</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Meteorology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3n204041j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:02:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The "United Nations Convention on Carriage of Goods by Sea, 1978", referred to as the "Hamburg Rules", will enter into force between the Contracting States on the 1st November 1992. This thesis examines the first five articles of the Convention and principally intends to depict their working in a structured and clear manner. It further reveals that their drafters primarily aimed: (1) at adjusting the distribution of the risks of sea-carriage between carrier and cargo-interest, which prevails under the "Hague Rules", to its contemporary legal and factual environment and (2) at promoting uniformity and certainty in the application of the Convention, as compared to the "Hague Rules". The Convention indeed significantly, as compared to these "Hague Rules", strengthens the fault-based liability of the carrier and expands the documentary, geographic and temporal scope of application of the mandatory regime that both of these conventions contain.</description><creator>Coens, Benoit.</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Carriers.</subject><subject>Maritime law</subject><subject>Liability (Law)</subject><subject>Bills of lading</subject><title>The "Hamburg Rules" : articles 1 to 5.1</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5138jg04d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3n204041j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1n79h570m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:02:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis, a method for calculating the decay rates and branching ratios using perturbative QCD and QED is proposed.

Previously, it has been shown that the molecular weight of CABP1 varies in different strains and that this variation is correlated with differences in response to cAMP. Sequence analysis showed that compared to its counterpart in strain AX2, the gene encoding CABP1 of strain V12M2 is missing 27 bp. AX2 transformants expressing the capA gene of V12M2 exhibited no change in phenotype, suggesting that CABP1 is not involved in the features examined or that the V12M2 variant is recessive. Disruption of capA by homologous recombination was attempted with no success, suggesting that this gene might be essential. Proteins interacting with CABP1 have been identified by immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies, CABP1 was also found to copurify with annexin VII, a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein, suggesting that CABP1 and annexin VII might interact.</description><creator>Bonfils, Claire</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Cyclic adenylic acid.</subject><subject>Dictyostelium discoideum.</subject><title>Functional analysis of capA and its product, the cAMP-binding protein CABP1, in Dictyostelium discoideum</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/db78td36x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/12579t43z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zg64tn226</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:02:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Gustatory sensilla in the blowfly Phormia regina contain five phenotypically distinct neurons. The neurons are thought to arise from a common precursor, however, little is known about their lineage or about how each one comes to assume a unique fate. This study examines the possibility that the neurons arise from a repeatedly dividing stem cell, in which case, the neuronal fate may be determined by birth order. To determine if the neurons are born at different times, their times of birth were assessed. This was achieved by using Hydroxyurea to arrest the gustatory neural precursors at different times throughout the development of the sensillum. Thus, each neuron's time of birth, relative to the arrest, was reflected by its presence or absence. The results show that the five neurons are born in a relatively short interval, and hence, cannot arise from five successive divisions of a stem cell. Therefore, the fate of each neuron cannot be determined solely by its time of birth.</description><creator>Banks, Stan R.</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Phormia regina -- Development.</subject><title>Development of gustatory sensilla in cultured imaginal leg discs of the blowfly Phormia regina</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fq977w27s.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zg64tn226</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):28075</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
