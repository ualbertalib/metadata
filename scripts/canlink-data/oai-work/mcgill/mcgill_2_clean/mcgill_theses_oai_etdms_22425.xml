It is argued that white society is struggling with an unresolved dialectic between its economic desires and its political idealism and that this conflict is expressed in native policy making as a simultaneous affirmation and denial of aboriginal rights. This theme is traced comparatively through Canadian and American native policy making histories from 1763 to 1990, focusing on three major policy areas: Indian dispossession, Indian political incorporation and Indian economic integration.</description><creator>McPherson, Shelley</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Indians of North America -- Government relations</subject><title>Native policy making in North America : the unresolved conflict between economic desires and political idealism</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5m60qt289.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xp68kh51j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wh246t141</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:56:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Bacteriophage Mu is an ideal system to study DNA transposition. The 70-KDa protein product of the phage early gene A, termed transposase, is absolutely required for transposition. Transposase binds specifically at sites located at both ends of the phage genome, termed attL and attR, and at an enhancer-like element at the left end of the genome, called IAS (internal activation sequence). It then nicks at these ends, and nicks a random target DNA sequence in a 5 base pair staggered fashion with 5$ sp prime$ extensions and promotes strand transfer between the Mu ends and the target DNA. The transposase protein can be roughly divided into three domains. The other activities of the protein have not been mapped even at the domain level. To further define the different functional domains of this complex enzyme, a series of insertion mutants at 8 different sites along the transposase protein were constructed using TAB linker mutagenesis. In this study, 1 and 2 TAB linkers were inserted into 8 HpaII sites in the Mu A gene, generating a set of 2 and 4 amino acid insertion mutants. Examination of these mutants for specific DNA-binding activity of transposase to the ends of the phage genome in vitro revealed temperature sensitive proteins. Transpositional activity of the mutant proteins revealed that the mutant proteins, which are temperature sensitive in specific DNA-binding activity, are deficient in transpositional activity.</description><creator>Forghani, Farnaz</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Biology, Microbiology.</subject><subject>Biology, Genetics.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Protein engineering of bacteriophage Mu transposase</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bz60cx592.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wh246t141</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n296x0120</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:56:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis analyses the making of the landscape and community of Westmount, Quebec from 1871 to 1929, when it grew from a quiet rural area into Montreal's foremost anglophone elite inner-city residential suburb. A cultural materialist approach to landscapes is adopted, viewing them analytically as a means to organize and assign existential meaning to human action towards the environment at a given time and place. The making of Westmount is placed within the context of Montreal's society in the 19th century, when rapid industrialization created massive wealth for the city's English-speaking business elite, but threatened its political domination. Westmount became the 'suburban solution' to this problem, providing a sanctuary where, by careful and pioneering use of municipal bylaws governing both land use and social conduct, a 'model' elite community and landscape was created and maintained. The degree of control obtained through the maintenance of Westmount's suburban autonomy allowed a strong expression in the landscape of a shared ideology of difference and privilege.</description><creator>Bryce, John Stephen</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Westmount (Quebec) -- History -- 19th century.</subject><subject>Community development, Urban -- Québec (Province) -- Westmount</subject><subject>Westmount (Quebec) -- History -- 20th century.</subject><title>The making of Westmount, Quebec 1870-1929 : a study of landscape and community construction</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5138jf92t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n296x0120</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6395w849m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:56:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The thesis describes a computer program (FASTP), written for the DOS environment and based on finite difference algorithms, which can be used to solve both transient heat and mass transfer problems. Relatively simple geometries can be used as building blocks to model problems in cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical coordinate systems. The user can model diffusion behavior through any material provided the relevant material properties are known. A completely menu driven system allows for the specification of a number of boundary conditions including convection, constant or zero flux, and radiation. Heat generation or mass accumulation, as well as interboundary resistance or partition coefficient terms can also be assigned. The program can also be used to model phase transformations and the effects of mixing in liquid systems. The results of several problems run on FASTP have been documented in this report and are shown to compare favourably with results generated from mathematically exact solutions.</description><creator>Brown, Murray J.

One hundred and seventy-three children from ten kindergarten classes in two schools participated in the study. Hypotheses that the Medieval Kingdom could be distilled from a sample of kindergarten children and that specific non-behavioral variables including cognitive ability, physical attractiveness, self-esteem, and chronological age were related to the assumption of leadership roles within the topology were confirmed. Children's gender, birth order, and number of siblings were not found to influence status within the social hierarchy. The findings suggest that the Medieval Kingdom is a potentially useful heuristic for understanding the peer relationships of kindergarten children.</description><creator>Bennett, Andrew, 1964 June 1st-</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Social role</subject><subject>Age groups</subject><subject>Preschool children</subject><title>The Medieval Kingdom topology : peer relations in kingergarten children</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r781wh19h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bn999783k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pk02cb96x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:56:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is a comparative, data-based analysis of the labour market experiences of the Italian and Jewish populations of Toronto at the end of the 1970s, beginning of the 1980s. It also provides historical and empirical information on the emergence and development of ethnic enclaves, and assesses whether such distinct enclave economies constitute channels for upward mobility for the Italian and Jewish individuals who participate in them. The historical findings provide evidence for the distinctiveness of an enclave labour market within these two ethnic communities. The empirical evidence reveals however, that participation in the enclave economies is quite low for Toronto's Jewish and Italian communities. The evidence does not indicate that participation in the enclave is associated with either economic benefits or losses. However, informal networks and ethnic ties have strong positive effects on enclavic participation.</description><creator>Psihopeda, Maria</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Italian Canadians -- Ontario -- Toronto</subject><subject>Jews -- Ontario -- Toronto</subject><subject>Toronto (Ont.) -- Economic integration.</subject><subject>Labor market -- Ontario -- Toronto</subject><subject>Ethnic groups -- Economic aspects -- Ontario -- Toronto</subject><title>Ethnic enclaves in urban Canada : a comparative study of the labour market experiences of the Italiana and Jewish communities in Toronto</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sf268633w.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pk02cb96x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Sociology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4t64gp510</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:56:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of the study was to develop, implement and evaluate a skill assessment instrument to evaluate expertise in defensive football. The Skill Assessment Scale: Defensive Backs (SAS:DB) was based on a knowledge-based approach to sport expertise which emphasized the integration of five types of knowledge about action: procedural, declarative, affective, metacognitive knowledge and metacognitive skills. After field testing, the revised SAS:DB was sent to coaches at; high school, college, university and professional levels of play for use with their players. The reliability, face validity and content validity of the SAS:DB scale were found to be very acceptable. Players at each playing level were categorized by their coaches into high, medium and low skill groups. Analysis of variance procedures demonstrated the ability of the scale to differentiate among these three skill levels and multiple discriminant function analysis identified the importance of the different knowledge-based categories at each level.</description><creator>Proudfoot, John A.</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Football</subject><subject>Athletic ability -- Testing</subject><title>The development, implementation and evaluation of a skill assessment instrument to evaluate expertise in defensive football /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nz806094q.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4t64gp510</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physical Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xp68kh533</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:56:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A user interface to EDS (Electromagnetic Design System) is designed using the X window System and the X Toolkit.

An historical introduction uncovers the implicit philosophy of botany in the work of its most eminent representative (Linne) and the logic of vegetal metaphors in the philosophy of history (Herder). How and why the cultivation of roses is transformed into a true cult and how gardening becomes a general metaphor extending its branches into the fields of psychology and pedagogy is shown by a detailed analysis of the novel. The strong rejection of any idea of grafting by the author, the controversy surrounding the use of flower imagery in literature, the peculiar beauty of crippled alder tress and the problem of "roots" in the general sense are also discussed. The question of the ethical value of purely ornamental objects is raised.</description><creator>Côté, André.</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Stifter, Adalbert, 1805-1868.

The KRE2 gene was cloned by complementation of the kre2-1 mutation and is predicted to encode a 433 amino acid protein directed into the secretory pathway. Haploid strains which carried a disruption at the KRE2 locus, grew more slowly than wild type cells, and showed a defect in the N-linked glycosylation of secreted proteins analysed. Genetic and protein analyses showed the defect to be in the assembly of the core oligosaccharide, most likely in the attachment of one or perhaps two mannose residues to the core structure. The mutant core in kre2 cells appeared to be a less efficient substrate for outer chain elaboration. A plausible interpretation of these results is that those mannose residues added to the core oligosaccharide in a KRE2 dependent manner are involved in the cross-linking of (1$ to$6)-$ beta$-D-glucan to mannoprotein in the cell wall to complete the K1 killer toxin receptor and failure to make such attachments is the basis of resistance to toxin in kre2 cells.</description><creator>Hill, Kathryn</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Saccharomyces cerevisiae -- Genetics.</subject><title>Characterisation of the KRE2 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9c67wn99q.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mp48sd83q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vt150k35x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:56:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study examines the effects of integrated reading, writing and inquiry instruction combined with direct instruction in summary writing on eighth and sixth grade students' text-based summaries. Forty-two innovative curriculum (IC) and forty-two traditional curriculum (TC) students were matched on ability. IC students produced significantly higher quality summaries, representing and integrating more levels of important information, than TC students. After instruction in the combined curriculum phase (CP), IC students produced better quality summaries that represented and integrated more levels of important information than after instruction in the integrated phase (IP). Grade level differences in summary quality and integration were attributable to mean scores of students after CP instruction. Grade level did not interact with curriculum phase to influence students' representation of levels of important information. Cognitive ability did not interact with curriculum phases on the above-mentioned variables. Descriptive analysis suggests that declarative knowledge influences students' ability to interpret summary writing rules and procedures, thereby affecting summary quality.</description><creator>Halliday, Frances E.

While humans also suffer from interference, connectionist networks experience a much greater loss of old material; this excessive retroactive interference is termed the sequential learning problem. This paper reviews two papers arguing that connectionist networks are unable to overcome the sequential learning problem, and five papers offering potential solutions. Simulations exploring issues arising from these reviews are described in the later part of the paper. It is true that connectionist models do suffer from the sequential learning problem. However, it appears that the problem is found only with simulations employing a strictly sequential training regime and involving small, unstructured item sets. Hence, there is no reason to believe that more realistic simulations of large, structured domains, such as language, will suffer from the sequential learning problem.</description><creator>Hetherington, Phil A.

Subjects participated in the Canadian Standardized Test of Fitness including (1) pre-test screening; (2) anthropometric; (3) cardiovascular; (4) flexibility and; (5) muscular endurance measurements. It was hypothesized that there would be no significant differences between the body composition, flexibility, cardiovascular fitness and muscular endurance levels of fire fighters compared to the average Canadian of similar age. Fire fighters had significantly lower VO$ sb2$max values and significantly greater scores for sit-ups, push-ups and flexibility for all age categories, compared to their counterparts.

Founder, with some friends from college, of la Releve (1934) and les editions de l'Arbre (1940), well-known novelist Charbonneau creates a critical work closely linked to that publishing and intellectual experience. Thus, literature, according to Charbonneau, is an economic phenomenon. But literature also fits in a world where the human is the dominant feature, where it is a preferred way to shed light on the human mystery. Influenced by Maritain and Mounier, admirer of Dostoevski and Mauriac, Charbonneau, with his Catholic viewpoint, conflicts with traditional French-Canadian nationalism because of the opening onto the world and the search for universality he proposes. The novel appears as the human expression's ideal form. Charbonneau finally wishes that French-Canadian literature be alive, human, and universal, and that its American meaning be understood. National is, in his opinion, unessential since a literary work is necessarily produced somewhere and, above all, intended to be literary in the first place.</description><creator>D'Ulisse, Nicolas</creator><date>1990</date><subject>French-Canadian literature -- History and criticism</subject><subject>Charbonneau, Robert, 1911-1967</subject><title>La critique de Robert Charbonneau /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cf95jc58b.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dj52w596n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:j098zc230</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:56:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis proposes to lay some of the groundwork for an investigation of the prepositional deficit in aphasia. We observe that (i) the status of the category PREPOSITION is problematic for linguistic theory and (ii) patterns of loss in aphasia do not affect prepositions uniformly. In accordance with the view that such sets of theoretical and aphasiological observations can and must be related, an overview of the structural (linguistic) properties of prepositions, an examination of a compatible sentence processing (psycholinguistic) model, and an exhaustive review of the literature on prepositions and aphasia were undertaken. A set of refined predictive hypotheses was then extracted. Preliminary results from a case study suggest that the theoretical argument/adjunct distinction is indeed valid on a processing level. Furthermore, they suggest it might be useful to re-frame the issue of how prepositional structures are compromised in pathology by considering how verb retrieval problems can affect the processing of those structures.</description><creator>Canzanella, Mary Ann</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Aphasia</subject><title>A study of prepositions in Aphasia : experimental results and their theoretical implications</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w0892b991.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j098zc230</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Linguistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0p0968191</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:56:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis reports on an investigation of unstable detonations near the limits of gaseous mixtures, which has been carried out in a continuous loop of 5 cylindrical tubes, of 11 m length each, of decreasing diameter (from 152, to 38 mm). The experiments were carried out for different mixtures of hydrogen, ethylene and propane in air, and also hydrogen-oxygen with argon as diluent. It is reasonable to seek a dependence of detonability limits on the geometry length scale of the system, i.e. the tube diameter d, and on the characteristic of the cell width $ lambda$. A d/$ lambda$ criterion has been proposed to define the limits in circular tubes. However, the present results show that such a correlation is not sufficient. For a ratio $ lambda$/d less than 1, the transition back to detonation occurred relatively easily within the length of the tubes. However, for $ lambda$/$d &gt;$ 1 the phenomena observed are highly unstable. Also mixtures of different components exhibit a different behaviour for the same $ lambda$/d ratio.</description><creator>Joannon, Josiane</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Detonability limits of gaseous mixtures in cylindrical smooth tubes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9s161739n.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0p0968191</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gq67js30r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:56:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this study was to develop a measure to assess parental attitudes toward childrearing. Through a review of the literature, seven constructs delineating varying maternal attitudes, styles and patterns were identified; Maternal Warmth, Control, Indulgence, Protection, Sensitivity, Play and Learning Receptivity. Employing item and correlational analyses, items were constructed and revised resulting in a new research instrument: The McGill Parental Attitude Toward Childrearing Questionnaire (MPATCR). Other variables considered included prior parenting experience, maternal age, ethnicity, occupation, employment, socioeconomic status, education, infant gender and medical birth complications. The results substantiated the importance of previous research findings indicating the importance of certain variables in differentiating childrearing attitudes and styles. Suggestions for modifications of the instrument and further research are discussed.</description><creator>Cohen, Mindy</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Parents -- Attitudes</subject><subject>Child rearing</subject><title>Parental attitudes toward child-rearing : toward the development of a new measure</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m613mz704.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gq67js30r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g158bj33r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:56:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Multienzyme systems with cofactor recycling have been immobilized within artificial cells (AC) to carry out certain metabolic functions in living cells. In liver failure there is an increase in systemic ammonia levels and a decrease in the ratio of branched chain (BCAA) to aromatic amino acids (AAA). The multienzyme system consisting of: urease, leucine dehydrogenase (LDH), glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) and immobilized coenzyme (dextran-NAD$ sp+$) is encapsulated in polyterephthalamide microcapsules with amyloglucosidase (AG) adsorbed on the surface: AG-MIC (1% albumin (BSA), Urease, LDH, GDH, dextran-NAD$ sp+$). Such AC may be administered orally where ammonia and urea would be removed while L-leucine, L-valine, L-isoleucine (BCAA) produced from the incorporation of ammonia to the corresponding $ alpha$-keto-acids would diffuse freely across the intestinal tract. Results show that 1 ml of 10% albumin filled AC with a mean diameter of 86.9 $ mu$m can adsorb a maximum of 94.87 mg of AG at PH = 8.0 and T = 37$ sp circ$C.</description><creator>Coromili, Vaia</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Chemistry, Pharmaceutical.</subject><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Amyloglucosidase immobilized on the surface of polyterephthalamide microcapsules containing multienzyme system with cofactor regeneration for the conversion of urea or ammonia to L-amino acids</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dn39x2523.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g158bj33r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n583xw14m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:56:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Objectif.

In this rheometer a novel transducer is used to measure the shear stress and an optical system is used to measure birefringence during flows involving high shear rates. The steady shear stress was found to be independent of shear rate at high shear rates. The Cox-Merz rule was found to be valid for concentrations less than 0.199 g.cm$ sp{-3}$, but a deviation from the rule was observed for higher concentrations. Sigmoidal damping functions, based on both the shear stress measurements and the birefringence measurements, were determined. The exponential stress coefficient and the third normal stress difference were calculated from experimental data for different values of exponential rate constant and different strain scale factor. The exponential rate constant was shown to have a strong influence on both the exponential stress coefficient and the third normal stress difference.</description><creator>Demarquette, Nicole Raymonde</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Nonlinear viscoelastic properties of polystyrene solutions</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6395w852x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k0698863r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6h440t58k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:56:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis describes the design of a pipeline architecture double precision floating point systolic cell for convolution.

The contents of protein, and both total and individual sugars of alkali extracted (amorphous) and citric acid extracted (bipyramidal and spheroidal) proteins from Phaseolus vulgaris (white kidney and navy) and Phaseolus lutanus (baby lima and large lima) beans were determined. The proteins were subjected to differential scanning calorimetry, and measurements of surface tension (air-water interface), surface hydrophobicity, and foam expansion. Structural analysis of the proteins were performed using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Enzymatic and chemical deglycosylation was performed on a white kidney bean protein isolate. Glucose and mannose were the major sugars found in the isolates. Bipyramidal and spheroidal microstructures with higher protein contents generally had greater mannose content and lower glucose content. Differences in enthalpy of denaturation $( Delta$H), surface tension decay curves, surface hydrophobicities, and foam expansions were observed with isolates of different microstructures. Corresponding differences in molecular structure were not, however, detected by FT-IR spectroscopy. Using statistical analysis, a relationship between foam expansion and the $ Delta$H, solubility, surface hydrophobicity and surface tension of the isolates was obtained. Preliminary results suggest that the removal of carbohydrate influenced the physico-chemical properties of the protein.</description><creator>Di Lollo, Antonio B.</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Beans.</subject><subject>Crystalloids (Botany)</subject><subject>Plant proteins -- Analysis.</subject><title>Thermal and surface properties of crystalline and non-crystalline legume seed proteins</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5h73px20v.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rv042v08r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:41687j66j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:56:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>An electret radiation dosimeter for long-term personnel monitoring is described. The design of this prototype (a modified parallel-plate ionization chamber) and the associated isothermal electret charging technique are presented. In the charging process, an external voltage causes ions created in air by the passage of radiation to move towards, and become trapped on, a dielectric (e.g., Mylar, Teflon) that covers the measuring electrode, forming an electret. Once the external voltage is removed, the field across the sensitive volume is produced by the electret charge, such that during subsequent irradiation, ions opposite in sign to those on the electret surface are attracted to the electret thus depleting the charge layer in an amount proportional to the exposure. Further irradiation releases the remaining charge on the electret which is measured with an electrometer. This technique allows the electret to be charged, used in the field, and discharged in situ, without dismantling the dosimeter as is required with other electret dosimeters relying on corona charging or other forming methods. Calibration, energy dependence, exposure range, and guard-ring effects of the dosimeter are discussed. This electret dosimeter may prove to be a viable alternative to film dosimeters and TLDs, and is inherently superior because the measuring medium is air.</description><creator>Ryner, Lawrence N.

Polyomavirus middle T antigen has an associated tyrosine kinase activity due to its interaction with the cellular tyrosine kinase pp60$ sp{ rm c-src}$. To more closely characterize the interaction of these two molecules I have sought to express polyomavirus middle T antigen and pp60$ sp{ rm c-src}$ in insect cells. A variety of transfer vectors have been designed to allow the introduction of foreign genes into the genome of baculoviruses. cDNAs encoding polyomavirus middle T antigen and pp60$ sp{ rm c-src}$ have been cloned into two such vectors that differ in their non-coding upstream sequences. Putative recombinant viruses were selected and examined for the expression of these two gene products. Although permanent recombinant viral stocks were not established, it was demonstrated that pp60$ sp{ rm c-src}$ can be produced in insect cells following transient transfection. Furthermore, this protein was shown to be biologically active as measured in the in vitro immune complex kinase assay. pp60$ sp{ rm c-src}$ produced in insect cells is capable to phosphorylating an exogenous substrate, enolase, in addition to undergoing autophosphorylation.</description><creator>Rodrigues, Gerard A.</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Expression of pp60C-SRC in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4f16c3926.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f7623d69r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wm117q09d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:56:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>For airlines, one of the most significant challenges in the 1990's will be to finance the enormous fleet replacement and expansion activities they have undertaken. Because airline earnings tend to by cyclical and industry returns on capital investment have traditionally been poor, lenders have come to rely increasingly on asset based methods to finance aircraft acquisitions. On account of the prevalence of asset based financing, the underlying legal structures must be able to reassure the lender, to a reasonable extent, that its interests in the aircraft will be protected and recognized. In Canada, the legal structures for taking security on aircraft are complex, as such interests are governed by the diverse provincial laws regarding security on moveable property generally. Moreover, rights in aircraft are not registered in one central location, but must be filed in accordance with the legislation of each province where the aircraft is likely to be used. The establishment of a central registry for security interests in aircraft would assuredly contribute to the future development of Canadian civil aviation. It would do away with multiple provincial registration of rights in aircraft and thereby add a considerable measure of certainty in the field of asset based aircraft financing.</description><creator>Rosales, Rex Kenneth</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Law.</subject><subject>Economics, Finance.</subject><title>Legal aspects of asset based aircraft financing</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s1784m91j.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wm117q09d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):22450</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
