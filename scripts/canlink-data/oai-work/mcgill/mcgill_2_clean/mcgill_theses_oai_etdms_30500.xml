An automated control system and peripheral vessels were used to perform cycling control, medium addition, broth removal and sampling. The apparatus was used to grow Bacillus subtilis and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus on different media. Both organisms supported a steady state SCF. Measurements of biomass, cycle time and minimum dissolved oxygen all gave repeatable results. Results were comparable to literature values for a cyclone column SCF apparatus. A gas analyzer was installed to measure oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations in the effluent gas. The response of the gas analyzer paralleled that of the dissolved oxygen measurements.</description><creator>Van Walsum, G.

The contribution of this thesis is a comparison of 3 general-purpose MIMD parallel processing systems as tools for intermediate-level vision, by evaluating them against criteria which capture the essential issues in programming intermediate-level vision algorithms on such machines. According to my criteria, the best-suited of the 3 systems is composed of the Id functional language running on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Tagged-Token Dataflow Architecture (M.I.T.

In the first part of this thesis, we study the geometry of envelope polygons (simple polygons which are the envelope of some arrangement). We show that envelope polygons are L-convex and derive several geometric properties of envelopes. Also, given an envelope polygon P, we show how to sort by slope in linear time the lines colinear with the edges of P. Using this result, we give a linear time procedure to verify if a given polygon is an envelope polygon. In the second part of this thesis, we introduce a hierarchy of classes of arrangements of lines based on the number of convex vertices of their envelopes. In particular, we look at a class called sail arrangements which we prove has properties that enable us to solve a number of problems optimally. Given a sail arrangement consisting of n lines (and O(n$ sp2$) vertices), we show how the prune and search technique can be used to determine all the convex vertices of its envelope in O(n) time. This implies that the intersection point with minimum or maximum x-coordinate, the diameter and the convex hull of sail arrangements (problems that have $ Omega$(n log n) complexity for arbitrary arrangements) can also be found in O(n) time. We show, in spite of this, that the problem of constructing the full envelope of a sail arrangement still has a lower bound of $ Omega$(n log n). Finally, we examine the existence of hamiltonian circuits through the intersection points of a non-trivial subclass of sail arrangements.</description><creator>Gu√©vremont, Eric</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Mathematics.</subject><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>On envelopes of arrangements of lines</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5712m781s.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gt54kp386</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1544bq60v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:19:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Previous in vitro binding studies for bile acids by polymeric ion-exchange resins indicate that the binding process involves three types of interaction; a predominant electrostatic interaction, a secondary hydrophobic interaction and a seemingly less important hydrogen bonding effect. To further investigate the nature of the sorption process, a family of ammonium-bearing polystyrene resins have been synthesized for the in vitro sorption of bile acid anions. A correlation was made between the structure of the resin pendant group and sorption efficiency. The extent to which the binding process is affected by bile acid anion by hydrophobicity was also studied. The primary importance of the ionic interactions was demonstrated by a marked increase in the sorption capacity of the resins with an increase in the number of ammonium groups per resin pendant group. Varying the length of the pendant hydrophobic spacer had a minimal effect on the binding, since, it is postulated, the hydrophobic backbone of the sorbents provides a degree of hydrophobicity sufficiently high to promote the binding of bile acid anions even at low C$ sb{ rm eq}$'s. In the competitive binding studies, the sorption of bile acid anions increased with increasing bile acid anion hydrophobicity and, in some cases, resin selectivity increased with an increase in the number of pendant ammonium groups and the length of the pendant hydrophobic spacer, as reflected by the relative binary separation factors of the resins.</description><creator>Whittaker, Martin</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Chemistry, Physical.</subject><title>Competitive binding of bile salts with ammonium-bearing polystyrene resins</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p8418p46x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1544bq60v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:j96022066</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:19:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Move ordering is important to alpha-beta tree search efficiency since a well-ordered minimax game tree precipitates more cutoffs than a randomly ordered tree. The use of move ordering heuristics is shown to be a valuable addition to the alpha-beta algorithm. Eight different move ordering heuristics are described and implemented on a skeleton chess program. The relative gains in search performance are observed for each individual heuristic as well as for combinations of heuristics. It is shown that when searching minimax game trees to a depth of 6 to 9 plies with well-chosen "killer" heuristics, reductions in search time and tree size exceed 80% on average. The effectiveness of move ordering heuristics is dependent on the depth of search and the scoring function used. With increased search depths, it is shown that the use of transposition tables to order moves becomes progressively more effective. Inversely, the use of Schaeffer's history heuristic is shown to be less effective with deeper searches. The use of a simple material-based chess scoring function is seen to have a strong influence on the performance of the capturing moves heuristic. It is observed that in this context, the ordering of captures improves search performance for materially unstable positions only.</description><creator>Th√©, Eric</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>An analysis of move ordering on the efficiency of alpha-beta search /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m039k632m.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j96022066</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:44558f47k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:19:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Some geometrical figures like balls, annuli and infinite strips are characterized by quadrature formulae involving mean values of certain harmonic functions.

Certain variants are closely associated with milk production, milk composition and milk qualities such as heat stability and cheesemaking properties. All of the milk protein variants known so far, have been detected by electrophoresis because mutations which have occurred gave rise to changes in net charges. "Silent" variants involve amino acid substitutions which are not accompanied by charge differences and hence would not be identified by electrophoresis. The aim of this project was to search for silent variants of $ alpha sb{ rm s1}$-casein, $ beta$-casein and $ kappa$-casein by application of reversed-phase HPLC for the identification of mutants causing changes in hydrophobicities of peptides. Whole casein from 281 Holstein and Ayrshire milk samples were fractionated by DEAE-cellulose ion-exchange chromatography, using an FPLC system. The pure forms of major caseins ($ alpha sb{ rm s1}$-casein, $ beta$-casein and $ kappa$-casein) were hydrolysed by trypsin and the digests obtained therefrom were resolved by reversed-phase HPLC. Comparison of peptide profiles within the same electrophoretic variant of homozygous caseins indicated that 24 out of 264 $ alpha sb{ rm s1}$-casein BB, 9 out of 57 $ beta$-casein A$ sp1$A$ sp1$, 5 out of 55 $ beta$-casein A$ sp2$A$ sp2$ and 8 out of 188 $ kappa$-casein AA could be classified as potential silent variants.</description><creator>Dong, Chin</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Milk proteins.</subject><subject>Genetic polymorphisms.</subject><title>Existence of silent variants of milk proteins</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/02870x129.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bc386k63b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Animal Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6m311q479</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:19:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The effect of the three intrinsic length scales of the medium (the bubble size $R sb0$, the interbubble spacing d and the tube diameter D) on the velocity and structure of the self-sustained reactive waves (SSRW) were investigated experimentally. The gas-liquid system studied consisted of water and stoichiometric or equimolar oxyacetylene. Two different tubes ($D=63mm$ and $D=146mm$) and two different average bubble sizes $R sb0=1mm$ and $R sb0=2mm$) were used, whereas the volumetric void fraction (which affects the bubble spacing d) was varied between 0.4% and 4%. Thus the conditions in the medium are always such that $R sb0&lt;&lt;d&lt;&lt;D$. For these conditions the experimental results indicate that: (1) the bubble size affects the structure but not the velocity of the SSRW; (2) the velocity of the SSRW increases when the bubble spacing is increased; (3) the SSRW is not affected by the tube diameter. The most important conclusion of this work is that combustion waves in bubbly liquids are not of the thermodynamic type, nor of the reactive-diffusive type. It is suggested that the phenomenon is of the "reactive-dissipative" type, where a dynamic equilibrium occurs between reaction and dissipation in the medium.</description><creator>Scarinci, Thomas</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Self-sustained reactive waves in bubbly liquids</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1v53jz406.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6m311q479</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nz8061069</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:19:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Women's poetic writing in modern China, its context and position in literary history as well as its ideological and social constitution are at the root of this thesis' subject. Having stated my intellectual and personal limitations regarding its writing as an introduction, examples of contemporary women's poetic text will serve to broaden its conclusion. My analysis begins with a reflection on its own terminology in philosophical debate, followed by a study of the modernist background that from 1977 leads to what is termed as neo-modernity in literature. A paradox in the women's avant-garde of antipatriarchal antagonism against the literary institution will be illustrated by examples of critical text on women's poetic production. My point is to address this paradox with the identification of false values placed from the very beginnings of poetic modernity on women's poetry within the avant-garde.</description><creator>Park, Christopher, 1966-</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Chinese poetry -- 20th century</subject><subject>Women poets, Chinese</subject><title>La modernit√© po√©tique des femmes chinoises : √©criture et institution</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bg257g24w.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nz8061069</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9g54xj84b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:19:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis deals with the myth of Maitreya, the next Buddha to come. The myth is traced from its earliest emergence in the Buddhist scriptures, briefly through its metamorphosis in China, with a view to presenting its evolution in Japan. The myth's history in Japan spans thirteen centuries, and as a result it is interesting to explore it in its historical context to see how the myth evolves and changes according to the exigencies of the times. Buddhism has in many ways been synthesized into the Japanese indigenous Shinto context, with the result that the myth of Maitreya has emerged not simply as a Buddhist figure, but a pan-Japanese phenomenon very much responding to the Japanese ethos of "world-mending". This underlying current has become particularly strong in the twentieth century with the result that Maitreya has become a vehicle for social rectification as well as hope.</description><creator>Niderost, Heather I.

This difference creates an aporia (a radical doubt, a sense of loss of familiar meaning) which disrupts the listening individual's sense of his or her previously 'unified' self. I show that these characters in Faulkner's novel do not have unified voices; their narratives develop as repetitions of the crisis moment when another's voice influenced their way of relating to themselves through language. I also show that the crisis of meaning that characters in the book experience is enacted on another level. A difficult book to read because of its many textual figures of doubt, Absalom may be said to generate a crisis of interpretation in its readers. This thesis offers a way of reading the text which explores the various potential meanings of these aporias in the novel's discursive surface, and so avoids the experience of crisis, of anxiety. This method of reading is based on the mode of reading exemplified by one of the text's own characters: Shreve McCannon, who is not discouraged by the fact that neither the narratives he hears nor the speculative, hypothetical narratives he produces in response make complete and coherent sense of everything.</description><creator>Worsley, Christopher Geoffrey</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Faulkner, William, 1897-1962.

A recent study by Breed and Koestner (1991) showed that all 3 of these factors enhanced motivation among 5th and 6th grade children in regular classes. The present study examined the relation of these variables to the motivation of 44 7th, 8th and 9th graders who were classified as learning disabled (LD). Results showed that children who are LD are significantly less likely than other children to attribute failures to a lack of effort. Results also showed that children who are LD, like children who are not LD, displayed enhanced motivation when incremental theories of intelligence are highlighted. Finally, it was shown that children who are LD do not respond to positive feedback with enhanced motivation, as would children who are not LD. In fact, there was a marginal trend for children who are LD who received neutral feedback to display more motivation than those who received very positive feedback. The study highlights the difficulty of providing positive performance feedback to LD children in a convincing manner.</description><creator>Ruttner, Jeffrey D.</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Motivation (Psychology)</subject><subject>Learning disabled children</subject><title>Motivational deficits among adolescents with mental handicaps</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20st92h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0g354g50r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9593tw41r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:19:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This work deals with the existence of a wide body of ballads in Italy during the romantic era.

The first two chapters of this thesis concentrate on the origins of the popular ballad and its first occurrence in Italy. The third chapter examines the major ballad writers in Italy.

This study examines the economic and socio-cultural impacts of tourism on Baunei, a community located on the eastern coast of Sardinia. The research shows that the type of tourism found in Baunei (i.e. locally controlled and small-scale) is providing benefits to local people without causing significant economic disruption or social conflict. The fact that residents are actively seeking to develop tourism in their area is perhaps the best indication that tourism is not acting as a disruptive force in Baunei.</description><creator>McVeigh, Colleen</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Tourism -- Italy -- Sardinia.</subject><title>Tourism and development in highland Sardinia : an economic and socio-cultural impact study of tourism in Baunei</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vq27zp640.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7s75dd68f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anthropology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:707958940</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:19:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><creator>Savard, Marielle</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Produce trade -- Econometric models -- Canada</subject><subject>United States -- Commerce -- Canada</subject><subject>Canada -- Commerce -- United States</subject><subject>Agricultural subsidies -- Canada.</subject><title>Impact of Canadian stabilization programs on pork exports to the United States</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/00000128w.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/707958940</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Agricultural Economics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n870zs022</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:19:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><creator>Sohati, Philemon Hakainda</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Tarnished plant bug.</subject><subject>Agricultural pests -- Biological control -- Qu√©bec (Province)</subject><title>Studies on the egg parasitoids of Lygus lineolaris (P. de B.)
