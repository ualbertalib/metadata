When they stop reporting they are transferred from the "live" pool of funds to the "defunct" pool. Consequently, liquidated funds constitute a subset of the defunct pool. I present models of hedge fund survival, attrition, and survivorship bias based on liquidation alone. This refines estimates of predictor variables in models of survival, leads to attrition rates of hedge funds to be roughly one half those previously thought, and produces larger estimates of survivorship bias. Survival models based on liquidated funds only, lead to an increase in survival time of 50 to 100 percent relative to survival based on all defunct funds. In addition to refining estimates of survival time, it is useful to examine how the double fee structure of hedge funds and Commodity Trading Advisors (CTA) affects the incentives of their managers. Young CTAs are usually very small --- they hold few financial assets --- and may not meet their operating expenses with their management fee alone, so their incentive is to take on risk and post good returns. As they grow, their incentive to take on risk diminishes. CTAs in their fifth year diminish their volatility by 25 percent relative to their first year, and diminish returns by 70 percent. We find CTAs to behave more like indexers as they grow, concerned with more with capital preservation than asset management. Operational risk is a major cause of hedge fund and CTA liquidation. In the banking industry, regulators have called upon institutions to develop models for measuring capital charge for operational losses, and to subject these models to stress testing. Losses are found to be inversely related to GDP growth, and positively related to unemployment. Since losses are thus cyclical, one way to stress test models is to calculate capital charge during good and bad economic regimes. We find loss distributions to have thicker tails during bad regimes. One implication is that banks will likely need to increase their capital charge when economic conditions deteriorate.</description><creator>Rouah, Fabrice.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Commodity futures -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Commodity trading advisors.</subject><subject>Financial risk management.</subject><subject>Hedge funds -- Mathematical models.</subject><title>Essays on hedge funds, operational risk, and commodity trading advisors</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Fabrice Rouah, 2007</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cc08hk77z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bg257j851</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Desautels Faculty of Management</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vx021k30d</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:46:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis presents a Lagrangian formulation of the Euler equations for subsonic flows. A special coordinate transformation is used to define the Lagrangian coordinates, namely the stream function and the Lagrangian distance, in function of the Cartesian coordinates. This Lagrangian formulation introduces two new geometry state variables, and a Lagrangian behavior parameter defining a pseudo-Lagrangian time used during the iteration procedure to obtain the solution for subsonic flows. The eigenstructure and characteristics analysis for the new system of equations is based on a linear Jacobian matrix-mapping procedure, which starts from the well-known eigenstructure and characteristics in the Eulerian plane and uses the coordinate transformation to find their counterparts in the Lagrangian plane. This analysis studies the basic properties of the Euler equations in the Lagrangian formulation, such as hyperbolicity, homogeneity and rotational invariance. The Riemann problem in the Lagrangian plane is also studied. Those elements are used to construct the numerical scheme for solving the Euler equations in the Lagrangian formulation. The numerical scheme is constructed using first and second-order dimensional-splitting with hybrid flux operators, based on flux vector splitting and Godunov methods, which include a 2-D Riemann solver in the Lagrangian plane. The numerical method is validated by comparing the present solutions with the results obtained with an Eulerian formulation for several internal flows. This numerical method based on a Lagrangian formulation has also been extended for the solution of unsteady subsonic flows by using a dual time approach. The method validation in this case has been done by comparison with the Eulerian formulation solutions for several internal subsonic flows with oscillating boundaries.</description><creator>Lu, Ming, 1968-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Aerodynamics -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Lagrange equations.</subject><subject>Unsteady flow (Aerodynamics) -- Mathematical models.</subject><title>A Lagrangian formulation of the Euler equations for subsonic flows /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Ming Lu, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hd76s443g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vx021k30d</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hh63t096j</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:46:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The thesis includes two essays on asset pricing. In the first essay, "Asset Pricing in a Monetary Economy with Heterogeneous Beliefs", we shed new light on the role of monetary policy in asset pricing by focusing on the case where investors have heterogeneous expectations about future monetary policy. Under heterogeneity in beliefs, investors place bets against each other on the evolution of money supply, and as a result, the sharing of wealth in the economy evolves stochastically over time, making money non-neutral. Employing a continuous-time, general equilibrium model, we establish these fluctuations to be rich in implications, in that they majorly affect the equilibrium prices of all assets, as well as inflation. In particular, we find that the stock market volatility may be significantly increased by the heterogeneity in beliefs, a conclusion supported by our empirical analysis. The second essay is titled with " Asset Pricing and Welfare Analysis with Bounded Rational Investors". Motivated by the fact that investors have limited ability and insufficient knowledge to process information, I model investors' bounded-rational behavior in processing information and study its implications on asset pricing. Bounded rational investors perceive "correlated" information (which consists of news that is correlated with fundamentals, but provides no information on them) as "fundamental" information. This generates "bounded rational risk". Asset prices and volatilities of asset returns are derived. Specially, the equity premium and the stock volatility are raised under some conditions. I also analyze the welfare impact of bounded rationality.</description><creator>Lu, Lei, 1975-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Rational choice theory.</subject><subject>Monetary policy.</subject><subject>Investments -- Valuation.</subject><subject>Decision making -- Econometric models.</subject><title>Essays on asset pricing with heterogeneous beliefs and bounded rational investor</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Lei Lu, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rj430891s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hh63t096j</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Desautels Faculty of Management</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5t34sp586</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:46:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>As operating frequency increases and device sizes shrink, the complexity of current state-of-the-art designs has increased dramatically. One of the main contributors to this complexity is high speed interconnects. At high frequencies, interconnects become dominant contributors to signal degradation, and their effects such as delays, reflections, and crosstalk must be accurately simulated. Time domain analysis of such structures is however very difficult because, at high frequencies, they must be modeled as distributed transmission lines which, after discretization, result in very large networks. In order to improve the simulation efficiency of such structures, model order reduction has been proposed in the literature. Conventional model order reduction methods based on Krylov subspace have a number of limitations in many practical simulation problems. This restricts their usefulness in general commercial simulators. In this thesis, a number of new reduction techniques were developed in order to address the key shortcomings of current model order reduction methods. Specifically a new approach for handling macromodels with a very large number of ports was developed, a multi-level reduction and sprasification method was proposed for regular as well as parametric macromodels, and finally a new time domain reduction method was presented for the macromodeling of nonlinear parametric systems. Using these approaches, CPU speedups of 1 to 2 orders of magnitude were obtained.</description><creator>Ma, Min.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Interconnects (Integrated circuit technology) -- Computer simulation.</subject><subject>Integrated circuits -- Very large scale integration -- Computer simulation.</subject><title>Model order reduction for efficient modeling and simulation of interconnect networks</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Min Ma, 2007</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xw42nd09n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5t34sp586</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:t722hf01b</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:46:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study examines the decision-making activities and communicative activities of two groups participating in a simulated medical emergency activity: the control group (CG) using a traditional whiteboard and the experimental group (EG) using a structured interactive whiteboard. The two groups differ in that the EG has a structured template to annotate and share their arguments with each other. Data analysis of the decision-making activities focused on planning, data collecting, managing, and interpreting patient data. Data analysis of the communicative activities focused on informative, argumentative, elicitative, responsive, and directive acts. In the early stage of decision-making the EG spent significantly more time interpreting the situation and less time managing the patient than the CG; in the later stage the EG spent significantly more time managing the patient but less time interpreting the situation. No significant results were found in communicative activities due to low cell frequencies of the utterances. Qualitative results indicated that shared visualizations can disambiguate and clarify verbal interactions and promote productive argumentation and negotiation activities. Shared cognition facilitates the construction of shared situation models and joint problem spaces which lead to better decision making and problem solving.</description><creator>Lu, Jingyan, 1971-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Problem solving -- Technological innovations.</subject><subject>Group decision making -- Technological innovations.</subject><subject>Medicine -- Decision making.</subject><title>Supporting medical decision making with collaborative tools</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Jingyan Lu, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cf95jg44m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t722hf01b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:73666900s</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:46:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Self-renewal is central to the expansion of normal and cancerous stem cells. Its understanding is therefore critical for future advances in transplantation-based therapies and cancer treatment. Although the molecular machinery controlling stem cell self-renewal remains poorly defined, a number of genes important to this process have recently been identified. Two prominent genes in this group are Hoxb4 and Bmi1. Members of our group led the way to demonstrate important regulatory functions of these genes in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal and expansion. The major goal of my thesis project is to dissect mechanisms that regulate self-renewal of HSCs. Our starting hypothesis was that HSC activity is regulated by complementary and independent self-renewal mechanisms: self-renewal of expansion and self-renewal of maintenance (Chapters 1-2). In order to further verify this theory, we have analyzed the genetic interaction between Hoxb4 and Bmi1. While Hoxb4 overexpression triggers HSC expansion, Bmi1 proper expression is essential to sustain long-term stem cell activity. We have also demonstrated that Hoxb4 and Bmi1 regulate distinct gene targets, likely suggesting a complementary and independent function for these two regulators in HSC activity (Chapter 3). The second part of this thesis highlights efforts that were made in order to get a better understanding of self-renewal mechanisms. We have identified potential new regulators of stem cell activity by characterizing a stem cell leukemia population (Chapter 4) and by assessing the expression of asymmetrical distributed factors (Chapter 5) and selected nuclear factors of the Hematopoietic Stem Cell Nuclear Factor Database (Chapter 6) in stem cell-enriched sub-fractions. This project will lead to a better understanding of the cellular basis regulating self-renewal of both normal and cancer stem cells and potentially to the future identification of new self-renewal determinants.</description><creator>Faubert, Amélie.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Homeodomain Proteins -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Proto-Oncogene Proteins -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Hematopoietic Stem Cells -- metabolism.</subject><title>Towards the identification of cellular and molecular regulators of hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Amélie Faubert, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/th83m3544.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/73666900s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fx719r36n</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:46:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>My dissertation discusses refugee rights and post-repatriation integration in South Asia in the context of debates over "citizenship." Postcolonial state-formation processes in South Asia have profoundly shaped questions of belonging and membership. As a result, official citizenship has become an important marker of group inclusion and exclusion in South Asian states. Using the literature on citizenship, I discuss the "belonging" claims of non-citizens (refugees) and argue that in practice this "belonging" extends beyond the state-centric "citizenship" view of membership. In doing so, I address two sets of interrelated questions: what factors determine whether or not refugees will be repatriated in South Asia, and why do some repatriated groups re-integrate more successfully than others in "post-peace" South Asian states? I answer these questions through a study of refugees from Sri Lanka and Bangladesh who sought asylum in India and were later repatriated to their countries of origin. The politics of postcolonial state-formation and subsequent discriminatory policies on language in Sri Lanka and non-recognition of the Jumma people in Bangladesh encouraged many citizens to flee to India as refugees. I argue, first, that India's state-centric politics of non-recognition of the two refugee groups contributed to their later repatriation. In the absence of rights and status in exile, refugees turned to "home" as a place to belong. I then analyze the post-repatriation variations in accommodation in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh as most refugees attempted to reclaim the lost identity and "citizenship" at "home" through the process of repatriation. However these countries pursued strategies of limited accommodation, which led to the minimal or partial re-integration of the two returnee-refugee groups.</description><creator>Chowdhory, Nasreen.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Refugees -- India.</subject><subject>Aliens -- Civil rights -- India.</subject><subject>Return migration -- Bangladesh.</subject><subject>Return migration -- Sri Lanka.</subject><subject>Repatriation -- South Asia.</subject><title>Belonging in exile and &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; : the politics of repatriation in South Asia</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Nasreen Chowdhory, 2007</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qn59q854c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fx719r36n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:m326m6120</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:46:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Through the lenses of critical pedagogy, cognitive psychology, marketing, curriculum development, traditional and informal education, and Black education, how one centre constructed and implemented critical edutainment is reviewed and scrutinized. The ethnographic study took place in a hyperreal (Baudrillard) setting using a bricolage of research methods: Seidman's 3-part interview protocol with workers and administrators; McMillan's focus group interview process with 9-12 year olds; participant-observation; field and reflective notes; and artefacts from external sources such as television broadcasts, newspapers, and official documents to gather and analyse data. In spite of its noble intentions, Gramsci's hegemony was witnessed and maintained through the centre's structure and organisation hence causing stress on the workers. Although the children and adults approved of the teaching and disciplinary acts, close regulation of their actions was done. Critical edutainment employs Vygotsky's zone of proximal development as it acknowledges the indigenous knowledges of adults and children and asks them to co-construct a curriculum that is cognitively, affectively, and socially relevant. It shows how curriculum construction, teamwork, accountability, and lessons learned from Black educators can be used to make a viable critical edutainment site that incites learning and fun.</description><creator>Deleveaux, Gia.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Non-formal education -- Case studies.</subject><subject>Blacks -- Education.</subject><title>Critical edutainment : an in-depth look at informal education at one facility</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Gia Deleveaux, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1n79h8490.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m326m6120</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h128nj97k</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:46:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This qualitative inquiry explores Chinese Canadians' experience of the death and dying of a family member in a Canadian cultural context.

Symptomatic treatments, which do not address the underlying nerve damage in diabetes, are currently the only therapeutic options for DPN, aside from rigorous control of blood glucose, which only occasionally reduces the incidence and severity of DPN. Given the progressive nature of disorder, and the failure of the classical neurotrophins in clinical trials for DPN, it is important to develop new therapeutics that can counteract the nerve damage in diabetes. Pancreas-derived peptides that stimulate islet regeneration have gained increasing interest for use in DPN, in part due to the unique similarities that exist between pancreatic and neural tissues. We studied the effects of one such peptide, the Islet Neogenesis Associated Protein (INGAP) peptide, on axonal regrowth in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) in adult C57BLJ6 mice. Using dorsal root ganglia (DRG) explant cultures as in vitro model of axotomy, we found that INGAP peptide enhances axonal regrowth in a time- and concentration-dependent manner that involves cyclic AMP-dependent activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and stimulation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K). The neuritogenic effects of INGAP peptide were reduced by blocking antibodies against a number of growth factors that are secreted by Schwann cells including nerve growth factor (NGF), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-(3), suggesting an indirect action of INGAP peptide on outgrowth from DRG neurons, achieved via a primary action on Schwann cells. To further assess the potential usefulness of INGAP peptide in DPN, we used streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic mice and found that after two weeks of INGAP peptide administration, begun twelve weeks after the STZ treatment, sensory dysfunction (reduced sensitivity to heat stimulation) was corrected without inducing the hyperalgesia associated with direct administration of NGF. These effects were accompanied by increases in the levels of a number of structural proteins and transcription factors associated with nerve growth. Significantly, the beneficial effects of INGAP peptide on the PNS in vivo occurred independently of its normalizing effects on hyperglycemia. Finally, we found that INGAP peptide enhanced the mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim), and that the mitochondrial effects were largely mediated by PKA. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that INGAP peptide enhances sensory axonal regrowth independently of islet neogenesis and the consequent secretion of insulin, and that it may be of benefit in the treatment of peripheral neuropathy associated with diabetes and possibly other clinical conditions.</description><creator>Tam, Joseph.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</subject><title>Effect of Islet Neogenesis Associated Protein (INGAP) peptide on axonal regrowth in the peripheral sensory nervous system and its therapeutic implications for diabetic peripheral neuropathy</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Joseph Tam, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v692tb494.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bg88f</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h415pf74h</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:46:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The CDP/Cux transcription factor is expressed as a 200 kDa protein that interacts rapidly and transiently with DNA. Proteolytic processing generates a shorter isoform, p110 CDP/Cux, that binds stably to DNA. Processing occurs at the G1/S transition of the cell cycle in normal cells, and constitutively in transformed cells. p110 CDP/Cux stimulates cell proliferation by accelerating entry into S phase. Transgenic mice expressing p110 CDP/Cux are more susceptible to different cancers. CDP/Cux was originally described as a repressor of transcription. My goal was to verify whether CDP/Cux might also participate in transcriptional activation and characterize the molecular basis for transcriptional activation by CDP/Cux. Using the DNA polymerase alpha gene promoter as a model system, I showed that stimulation of a DNA pol alpha reporter correlated with DNA binding. Importantly, p110 CDP/Cux stimulated expression from the endogenous DNA pol alpha promoter. Linker-scanning analysis of the DNA pol alpha promoter identified a cis-element that was required for p110-mediated activation, yet was not bound by it. I determined that E2F1 and E2F2 cooperated with p110 in activating the DNA pol alpha promoter, and did so via this cis-element. Furthermore, CDP/Cux recruited these E2Fs to the promoter in chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. Location array analysis revealed many targets common to p110 and E2F1. DNA metabolism and cell cycle targets were overrepresented, and further studies showed that p110 and E2F cooperated to activate many cell cycle genes. I also described a second proteolytic event, which generated an isoform lacking two active repression domains in the C-terminus. Processing was observed in S phase, but not in early G1, suggesting that processing occurs in proliferating cells. I determined that caspases were responsible for this processing, and that this occurs in non-apoptotic conditions. A C-terminally-truncated CDP/Cux protein was a more potent activator of cell cycle-regulated promoters, and accelerated entry of Kit225 T cells into S phase, while uncleavable p110 CDP/Cux proteins were inactive in both assays. These results identified p110 CDP/Cux as a substrate of caspases in proliferating cells, and suggested a mechanism by which caspases may accelerate cell cycle progression.</description><creator>Truscott, Mary.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>The molecular basis of transcriptional activation by the CDP/Cux transcription factor /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Mary Truscott, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20sz025.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h415pf74h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kh04dt60n</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:46:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Control of mRNA translation is one of the major regulatory events in eukaryotic gene expression. Recent research has established the existence of a protein kinase family in mammalian cells, whose members phosphorylate the alpha (alpha) subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2 (eIF2alpha) at serine 51 and regulate mRNA translation under various stress conditions. The interferon (IFN)-inducible double-stranded (ds) RNA-activated protein kinase PKR is the prototype of this family. Stress conditions activate PKR by autophosphorylation which leads to inhibition of global protein (including viral protein) synthesis and the apoptosis of infected cells. PKR has been well-characterized as a serine/threonine kinase. However, the tyrosine kinase property of PKR and its functional activity remains undetermined. This study demonstrates that human PKR possesses tyrosine kinase activity and undergoes autophosphorylation at tyrosine (Tyr) residues 101, 162 and 293 in vitro and in vivo. Phosphorylation at these tyrosine residues enhances dsRNA binding-efficiency as well as the dimerization of PKR, which in turn favours the full-scale kinase activation and its substrate phosphorylation. Biologically, tyrosine phosphorylated PKR mediates the anti-viral and cellular anti-proliferation activity of the enzyme through its ability to regulate protein synthesis. In addition, the IFNs modulate PKR at both the transcriptional and posttranslational level. Specifically, tyrosine phosphorylation of PKR is inducible in response to stimulations with IFNs. The Janus kinases (Jaks), a group of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, are the upstream enzymes which phosphorylate PKR at Tyr101 and Tyr293 in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, induction of PKR tyrosine phosphorylation by IFNs presents a critical missing link between IFN signaling and the translational machinery which contributes to the early effect of IFNs in inhibiting viral protein synthesis. Such a prompt reaction might allow cells to induce IFN responsive-genes and further fortify the antiviral state of the host.</description><creator>Su, Qiaozhu, 1965-</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Control of eIF2 alpha kinases by tyrosine phosphorylation : implications for gene translation and anti-viral signaling</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Qiaozhu Su, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6q182q41s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kh04dt60n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:t148fn334</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:46:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The perirhinal cortex (PRC) and the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) are essential components of the medial temporal lobe memory system, but the functional organization and interconnectivity of these structures is poorly defined. In this thesis, novel in-vitro and in-vivo approaches were developed to investigate the synaptic organization, intrinsic properties and cholinergic modulation of neurons in the PRC and LEC. In-vivo and in-vitro field potential profiles, combined with current-source density analysis and in-vitro intracellular recordings, demonstrated the existence of bi-directional excitatory synaptic interactions between the PRC and the LEC. Intracellular recordings and dye injection were also used to perform a morphological and electrophysiological characterization of principal neurons located in layers II and III of the LEC. These studies revealed that principal neurons in layer II of the LEC possess more heterogeneous morphological and electrophysiological properties than those in layer III. Moreover, layer III principal neurons display extensively arborized basal and apical dendrites that extend into layers I, II, III and V. This widespread arborization may allow these neurons to integrate neural signals destined for, and coming from, the hippocampus. We also discovered that muscarinic cholinergic receptor activation allows principal neurons in layer III of the LEC to generate persistent activity at a fixed frequency following an excitatory stimulus. This activity can be terminated by the application of another excitatory stimulus, allowing the cells to toggle between "On" and "Off" states. Finally, pharmacological and ionic substitution experiments in-vitro established that the "On" and "Off" states of these cells are respectively dependent on Ca 2+-dependent non-specific channels, and BK-type Ca2+-dependent K+ channels. These studies expand our understanding of the network and cellular mechanisms by which neurons in the PRC and LEC may contribute to long-term and short term memory.</description><creator>Tahvildari, Babak.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Functional organization of the perirhinal-lateral entorhinal circuit</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Babak Tahvildari, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xw42nd10d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t148fn334</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9z9034200</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:46:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Signaling by growth factors from the TGFbeta/activin has a profound impact on cancer development. They can either negatively regulate tumor development by their ability to inhibit cell growth, induce apoptosis and limit the number of cell divisions through inhibition of telomerase activity, or positively promote cancer through the induction of angiogenesis, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and the suppression of the immune response. These ligands bind to serine-threonine kinase receptors that phosphorylate the Smad proteins: Smad2 and Smad3. Once phosphorylated, Smad2/3 cooperate with Smad4 to activate or repress expression of TGFbeta and activin target genes. It is the combined expression/repression of the numerous target genes that determine the physiological outcome of TGFbeta and activin signaling. In this thesis, we have characterized the molecular mechanisms by which TGFbeta and activin repress two target genes that are often overexpressed in human tumors. First, we studied the inhibitory effects of TGFbeta/activin on cell growth and prolactin (PRL) production in pituitary lactotroph tumor cells, as prolactinomas are tumors that secrete large amounts of PRL, causing endocrine and reproductive disorders. We showed that activin represses PRL expression through the Smad pathway and the tumor suppressor menin by downregulating the expression of Pit-1, a pituitary transcription factor essential for PRL expression. Second, we wanted to understand how TGFbeta inhibits hTERT gene expression, the gene encoding for the protein component of telomerase. In 90% of cancers, telomerase is reactivated through the induction of hTERT, allowing cancer cells to become immortal. Using the keratinocyte HaCaT cell line, we showed that TGFbeta rapidly increased E2F-1 expression, through the Smad pathway, Erk and p38 kinases. We identify four binding sites for E2F as critical for hTERT inhibition by TGFbeta. Moreover, interfering with E2F activity also abolishes hTERT inhibition by TGFbeta. These data identify E2F-1 as the intermediate factor required by TGFbeta to repress hTERT expression. Understanding the mechanisms used by TGFbeta and activin to regulate their target genes is important to improve our basic knowledge on how cancers progress. More importantly, it can create new avenues for cancer therapy development.</description><creator>Lacerte, Annie.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways induced by TGF [beta] for transcriptional repression of target genes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Annie Lacerte, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vq27zs533.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z9034200</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8049g910f</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:46:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Mutations in the Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD-1) gene are responsible for a familial form of the motor neuron disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS). Aggregation of mutant SOD1 and formation of cytoplasmic inclusions are pathological hallmarks of the disease in patients and in transgenic mouse models of fALS, and their occurrence suggests overload of proteolytic and protein chaperoning pathways. We studied proteasomal function in transgenic mice over-expressing human SOD-1 carrying the fALS-related mutation G93A (SOD1 G93A). Reduction in proteasomal activities in the lumbar spinal cord (containing vulnerable motor nuclei), but not thoracic spinal cord (less affected area) of pre-symptomatic SOD1G93A transgenic mice relative to non-transgenic littermates and SOD-1WT transgenic mice was measured early in disease pathogenesis. In addition, there was reduction of a subunits of the 20S proteasome in lumbar spinal motor neurons relative to the surrounding neuropil with disease progression. Decreased proteasome activity in lumbar spinal cord corresponded with reduced levels of beta3 (non-catalytic) and beta5 (chymotrypsin-like activity) subunits of the 20S proteasome, despite normal levels of 20Sa subunits in the tissue as a whole. Even though levels of beta3 and beta5 were decreased, they were incorporated into 20S and 26S proteasome complexes as determined by native gel electrophoresis. Levels of beta3 and beta5 mRNA were not decreased in lumbar spinal cord of SOD1 G93A transgenic mice prior to onset of symptoms, indicating unimpaired transcription and mRNA stability. Nor was there evidence that mutant SOD1 inhibited the proteasome by remaining associated with and blocking proteasomes. The relevance of findings in this mouse model of fALS to sporadic ALS was investigated by measuring proteasome activities and expression of proteasomal subunits in autopsy tissue from sporadic ALS patients As in fALS mice, proteasome activity was reduced in extracts of an affected region of spinal cord from ALS patients as compared to controls, whereas the proteasome activity in cerebellar tissue from these patients was not affected. This impairment was coupled with a decrease of 20S beta5 and 19S5a protein levels in spinal cord tissue suggesting that proteasome function is compromised in both familial and sporadic forms of ALS.</description><creator>Kabashi, Edor.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>The role of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Edor Kabashi, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r207tt38w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8049g910f</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:js956m14v</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:46:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Formation of gametes capable of supporting development is dependent on a number of genetic and epigenetic events. DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification catalyzed by enzymes named DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). In the mouse, methylation of DNA is associated with the control of gene expression and proper embryo development. Methylation patterns are established in a sex- and sequence-specific manner during male and female germ cell development and further modified during early embryonic development. Even though new DNMTs have recently been identified, little information is known on the origin of the methylation marks during male germ cell development (spermatogenesis). The main goal of the work presented in this thesis was to gain a better understanding of the enzymes involved in creating the epigenetic program of the male genome. The first step in doing so involved comparing the temporal expression profiles of DNA methyltransferases in the developing testis and ovary. The expression profiles obtained indicated that in the male, DNMT3a and DNMT3L could be involved in de novo methylation while DNMT3b and DNMT1 could be responsible for maintaining methylation patterns following DNA replication. Next, characterization of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b expression in isolated postnatal male germ cells revealed how tightly regulated the expression of these genes is during spermatogenesis: specific transcript variants and protein isoforms of each DNMT are differentially expressed during male germ cell development. Finally, assessing the effect of Dnmt3L inactivation on the male germ line exposed the presence of a mitotic defect in germ cells lacking this protein. DNA methylation analyses revealed that many loci throughout the genome are marked for methylation by DNMT3L, indicating a more global role for this enzyme than that previously reported in genomic methylation patterning in the male germ line. As methylation patterns instituted during spermatogenesis have to be properly established for accurate transmission of epigenetic information to the next generation, the studies presented here contribute to our knowledge of the events leading to the creation of the epigenetic program necessary for the formation of healthy gametes.</description><creator>La Salle, Sophie.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Biology, Genetics.</subject><title>Origin of DNA methylation patterns in the male germ line : roles of the novel DNA methyltransferases in male germ cells</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Sophie La Salle, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2v23vz10r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/js956m14v</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cj82kc586</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:46:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Two important steps of translation initiation include the recognition of the mRNA cap structure by eIF4E and the recycling of erF2. Each step is thought to be regulated independently through the interaction of eIF4E with 4E-BPs and the phosphorylation of the a subunit of eIF2 at serine 51. Phosphorylation of eIF2alpha by dsRNA-dependent protein kinase PKR inhibits protein synthesis in cells subjected to virus infection; therefore, most viruses have evolved mechanism to overcome the deleterious effects of PKR. The human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 oncoprotein contributes to virus-induced pathogenicity through multiple mechanisms including the inhibition of apoptosis and the blockade of interferon action. This study demonstrates a novel function of PKR providing a link between the two mechanisms of regulation of translation initiation. Activation of PKR induces the PI3K-PKB/Akt and FRAP/mTOR pathways leading to S6 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation upon stress conditions and in response to growth stimuli. Induction of the PI3K pathway antagonizes the apoptotic effects of PKR activation, but does not intervene with its translational inhibitory activity. Investigating functional interaction of HPV E6 and PKR, we determined that BPV-18 E6 protein synthesis is regulated by eIF2alpha phosphorylation. On the other hand, E6 oncoprotein is able to rescue cells from PKR-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis and induction of apoptosis by promoting eIF2alpha dephosphorylation through physical association with GADD34/PP1 holophosphatase complex. These findings demonstrate, for the first time, the ability of PKR to activate a growth-stimulatory pathway; PI3K. Furthermore, it demonstrates role of oncogenic E6 in antagonizing signaling pathways induced by PKR including eIF2alpha phosphorylation and PI3K pathway.</description><creator>Kazemi, Shirin.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>The role of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha phosphorylation pathway in translational control and virus-mediated oncongenesis /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Shirin Kazemi, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5t34sp607.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cj82kc586</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1544bt54b</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:46:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The reaction of nitric oxide with secondary amines to form diazeniumdiolate anions with the structure R2NN2O2 - has been studied in order to investigate the stereochemistry and mechanism of this reaction. The stereochemical preference of the cis (Z) isomer for these compounds was proved using vibrational spectroscopy, namely infrared spectroscopy (IR) and Raman. Theoretical (B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ) rotation barriers for the simple diazeniumdiolate anion, Me2NN(O)=NO- are calculated in the gas phase to be 26.2 kcal/mol with the cis isomer predicted to be stabilized by only 0.5 kcal/mol compared to the trans isomer, therefore stereochemical preference for the cis is due to kinetic rather than thermodynamic control. Using vibrational spectroscopy to characterize the anion, it was determined that if the trans (E) isomer is present it represents &lt;0.002% of the total composition. The mechanism of nitric oxide's reaction with secondary amines was elucidated using both synthetic and kinetic methods. Attempts at preparing diazeniumdiolates (NONOates) by reacting nitric oxide directly to various radical anions proved to be unsuccessful. The result of these reactions is the formation of many reaction products, many of which could not be conclusively identified. The rate of these NO-amine condensation reactions was found to be dependent upon the solvent in which the reaction was conducted, with modest rate enhancements obtained in heterocyclic organic bases. In addition to differences in rate, the overall yield of diazeniumdiolate recovered was found to be highly dependent on solvent choice as well as amine structure. Kinetic measurements for the formation of these compounds indicate that the rate law is multi-term and the order of reaction with respect to nitric oxide depends greatly on the concentration of nitric oxide. At low nitric oxide concentrations the dependency on nitric oxide is first order, however as the NO concentration increases the order of the reaction becomes second order in [NO]. The decomposition profile of amine derived diazeniumdiolates in aqueous media is significantly different than in organic solutions. In alkaline aqueous solutions the rate of decomposition is slow, with no significant decomposition occurring after several hours. This decomposition can be accelerated by lowering the pH. In non-aqueous solutions, the rate decomposition of the anion was determined to be comparable to the rate in neutral aqueous solutions. Finally the equilibrium constant for the rate determining step for the reaction of nitric oxide with the secondary amine, pyrrolidine in pyridine was elucidated. The equilibrium constant for the rate limiting step was found to be 1.1 M-1.</description><creator>Smith, Kamilah.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Nitric oxide.</subject><subject>Amines.</subject><subject>Stereochemistry.</subject><title>Mechanism and stereochemistry of the reaction of nitric oxide with secondary amines</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Kamilah Smith, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8623j3184.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1544bt54b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fb494d573</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:46:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Over-expression of the human GPI-linked carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family members CEA and CEACAM6 is a common feature characteristic of about 70% of human cancers including colon, breast and lung. CEA and CEACAM6 belong to the CEA subfamily of cell surface intercellular adhesion molecules within the immunoglobulin superfamily. It has previously been demonstrated that its over-expression inhibits cellular differentiation, blocks cell polarization, distorts tissue architecture, and inhibits anoikis in vitro. Although our laboratory previously demonstrated the role of integrin alpha5beta1, the main receptor for the ECM component fibronectin, in the CEA-mediated inhibition of differentiation and anoikis in vitro, the molecular mechanism implicated in these inhibitory effects remained unclear. In this work, we established a model for CEA signaling in which clustering of CEA molecules in the cell surface induces membrane microdomain aggregation and subsequent co-clustering and activation of the integrin alpha5beta1 and associated integrin-signaling elements such as the P13-K and MAPKinase cascades. Further studies done in a transgenic mice harboring part of the human CEACAM family gene locus (CEABAC), with similar protein expression patterns as those found in humans, allowed us to extrapolate these in vitro observations to an in vivo system. At low to moderate expression levels of CEACAM6, we found transgene copy number-dependent increases in CEABAC colonocyte surface levels of integrin alpha5 and Akt activation. An increase in colonocyte proliferation, an inhibition of differentiation, and marked inhibition of colonocyte anoikis/apoptosis was also observed. At tumor-like expression levels, this phenotype was accentuated, CEABAC mice showed massively enlarged colons with dysplastic and serrated adenomatous morphology. Subsequent analysis of the molecular mechanism involved in the CEA-mediated anoikis inhibition, demonstrated that the CEAGP1 anchor and self-adhesive extracellular domains were crucial for the CEA inhibitory anoikis signal, implicating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and the PI3-K cascade. In summary, the results presented in this thesis establish a potential molecular mechanism involved in CEA-mediated tumorigenic effects.</description><creator>Camacho-Leal, Maria del Pilar.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Health Sciences, General.</subject><title>Molecular analysis of the tumorigenic effects mediated by human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Maria del Pilar Camacho-Leal, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d791sm40m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fb494d573</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bn999b90m</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:46:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The design and characterization of both electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) and inter-coupled split-ring resonator (SRR) structures utilized in microwave frequencies were proposed and studied. A new double-stopband EBG structure with a passband region of 14 to 18 GHz was initially constructed by determining the critical structural ratios. To reduce the size of EBG structure, a novel tapered array pattern was introduced. The structural period, the number of slot, and the length of slot were examined and a strong correlation was found between the lowpass cutoff frequency and the center slot length. Non-linearly tapered configuration was applied to enhance the filter performance and its size was only 57% of the conventional EBG structure. Inter-coupled SRR was also examined and utilized as a bandpass filter when it is implemented on the microstrip line for the first time. It was found that the proposed structure can provide a fractional bandwidth of over 68% with an insertion loss of 0.81 dB in the passband region with a device size of 15.5 mm. Chemical bath deposited Cadmium Sulfide (CdS) thin film was applied to the microwave structures to construct switchable filters. The illumination-sensitive CdS thin film's sheet resistance has been demonstrated to be able to switch from 300 to 109 O/square. With the proposed "conductive-islands" implementation, switching of EBG structure's transmission coefficient (S21) was achieved from 31.3 dB to 5.6 dB at 13 GHz. The inter-coupled SRR structure also showed a S21 switching response from 19 dB to 1.5 dB at 5 GHz. Therefore, optically controlled microwave filters were successfully constructed and realized. Critical contributions in the field of microwave periodic structures are the characterization and the construction of double-stopband structure, linearly and non-linearly tapered array structures, and inter-coupled SRR structures. Vital characteristics and advantages discovered include wide stopband, reduced size, and large fractional bandwidth. Chemical bath deposited CdS thin films were studied to achieve an ultra low sheet resistance and high photosensitivity. Important applications associated with these structures are microwave lowpass/bandpass filters and optically controlled filters.</description><creator>Wu, Jay-Hsing, 1979-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Strip transmission lines.</subject><subject>Photonic crystals.</subject><title>Designs and characterization of switchable microwave electromagnetic bandgap and split-ring resonator structures</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Jay-Hsing Wu, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nc580r79r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bn999b90m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bz60d1803</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:46:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Electro-optic (EO) beam deflectors are voltage-controlled devices widely used for scanning and switching applications. For example, high-speed, low-loss optical switches aimed at future optical networks can be built on EO deflectors. Novel EO deflectors distinguish themselves with a much-improved steering performance, high-speed response and simple fabrication requirements. Patterned ferroelectric crystals such as LiTaO3 are first poled to provide the required prism shaped domain structures. The application of an electrical field across the entire crystal can then be used to drive the trajectory of the beam as it travels through the poled wafer. The electric field induces an index change of opposite magnitude on the adjacent domain regions in the EO device, causing the optical beam to refract at the interfaces. Although rectangular geometry is extensively employed in EO devices, nonrectangular scanners have demonstrated better deflection performance. Two new nonrectangular geometries capable of further enhancing the deflection performance of EO beam scanners, proposed in this dissertation, were constructed. Their parabola and half-horn geometries provide 2-3 degrees of steering, which is 2-3 times greater than the steering provided by rectangular deflectors. EO deflectors based on the parabola and the half-horn geometries, which can provide larger deflection angles, were built. These devices demonstrated a deflection angle of 3.1°, less than 5 dB of insertion loss from fiber to fiber, and -40 dB of crosstalk. Two packaged optical switches using rectangular EO deflectors were demonstrated. By combining these EO deflectors with fiber collimators and high voltage packaging, high speed optical switches were built and characterized. The switch design was based on a 500mum z-cut LiTaO3 single crystal wafer fabricated using the domain inversion method. The 1x2 switch had a maximum deflection angle of 1.22° with an applied voltage of 1.1 kV and the 1x4 switch had a maximum deviation angle of 2.14°, with an applied voltage of 1 kV. The average insertion loss and crosstalk figures were 2.36 dB and -36 dB, respectively. The worst case switching time was 86 ns.</description><creator>Zuo, Yiying, 1974-</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Telecommunication -- Switching systems -- Equipment and supplies.</subject><subject>Electrooptical devices -- Design and construction.</subject><title>Design, analysis, and implementation of multi-port refraction based electro-optic switches</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Yiying Zuo, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dz010v140.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bz60d1803</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vh53x1116</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:46:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Consumer's demand for more natural and high quality food products products, presenting health benefits, has increased over the years. Besides the nutritional aspects, an appealing appearance and texture is also required. Cloudiness or opacity (cloudy appearance) is an important citrus drinks property (orange, lime, lemon, etc.), since it gives natural fruit juice appeal. This property can be achieved through addition of clouding agents, which also help in uniform distribution of flavors throughout the liquid beverage. A common problem in the beverage industry is producing cloud or flavor emulsions that remain stable over the desired shelf life. Beverage cloud emulsions are oil-in-water emulsions to provide cloudiness and are prepared in a concentrated form, but diluted prior to the consumption. Optical and rheological properties of beverage cloud emulsions as a function of water-phase and oil-phase concentrations were investigated. The specific gravity of phases, particle size distribution and creaming stability of prepared emulsions in diluted forms were evaluated. The rate of cloud emulsion creaming by determining the rheology of water phase, difference in specific gravities of the phases and droplet properties of the emulsion in presence and absence of weighting agents (sucrose acetate isobutyrate and brominated vegetable oil) or/and xanthan gum was studied. Flow and dynamic rheological properties of single-phases and emulsions containing modified starch and arabic gum as surface active hydrocolloids as well as xanthan and tragacanth as stabilizers gums were investigated. Finally, stability of cloud emulsions in orange juice drink was examined. Oil-phase concentration had a significant effect (P &lt; 0.05) on increasing the opacity of emulsion. Raise in viscosity of emulsions was more pronounced as oil concentration increased and shear thinning behavior of oil added emulsions was associated with droplet flocculation. Creaming in acidified sugar solution of 11°Bx and pH 3 was observed when the oil-phase specific gravity decreased and sedimentation occurred at the lower viscosity of water phase. Addition of xanthan gum into the water phase decreased the flow behavior index (n) form 0.88 down to 0.31 and increased elastic modulus (G') over 20 times at elevated frequency (o = 50 rad/s) and perk up the stability of the emulsion. The xanthan gum added emulsion indicated smaller average particle size and demonstrated 14 and 5 times slower separation compared to the emulsions without or with the addition of weighting agents respectively. Starch-xanthan stabilized emulsion and associated water phase at 1.5:1 surface active gum to oil ratio demonstrated viscoelastic behavior (G' ≥ G") with lower droplets coalescence and creaming rates, 0.013 nm/day and 0.02 percent backscattering/day respectively. Conversely, arabic-xanthan stabilized emulsion at 1:1 gum to oil ratio showed the highest rate of droplets coalescence at 0.057 rim/day and greater degree of creaming at 0.61 percent transmission/day. While creaming were associated with arabic gum stabilized emulsions, after 3 month storage, modified starch illustrated appropriate shelf stability with no sign of creaming in orange juice drink.</description><creator>Taherian, Ali Reza.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Xanthan gum.</subject><subject>Emulsions.</subject><subject>Orange juice.</subject><title>Rheology and stability of beverage emulsions in concentrated and diluted forms</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Ali Reza Taherian, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r207tt395.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vh53x1116</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7h149t78b</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:46:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Memory refers to the retention of learned information or experiences in the brain. It is known that interference of certain brain functions immediately after training or memory reactivation can cause memory loss (i.e. amnesia). The post-training process is called consolidation and the post reactivation process is called reconsolidation. However, it remains unclear as to: (1) whether appetitive, goal-directed memories undergo reconsolidation, (2) whether overtrained memories undergo reconsolidation, (3) what the nature of amnesia is (i.e. whether it represents storage or retrieval impairment), (4) how to test the nature of amnesia, and (5) whether the brain uses the same mechanism for a new learning and from a second learning. This thesis, composed of five manuscripts, aims to answer these questions. In the first manuscript, the model of incentive learning of appetitive outcomes in instrumental conditioning was used. Protein synthesis inhibitor (PSI) was infused into lateral and basal amygdala (LBA) after the new incentive learning and after the reactivation of the memory. The results show that appetitive memories in controlling goal-directed behaviors underwent consolidation and reconsolidation in the LBA. In the second manuscript, rats were overtrained with auditory fear conditioning and received intra-LBA PSI infusions after memory reactivation. The results show that only old, but not recent, overtrained auditory fear memories underwent reconsolidation. This suggests overtraining sets a boundary condition on memory reconsolidation. Further results showed dorsal hippocampus and intra-LBA NR2B-subunit containing N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors (NMDAr) were involved in this boundary condition. In the third manuscript, the unresolved debate about the nature of amnesia was reviewed from a historical perspective and the suggestions on reconciling this issue are proposed. In the fourth manuscript, a new approach was used to test the nature of amnesia in contextual fear conditioning. Because NMDAr blockade impairs a new learning but not a second learning, it is predicted that if a memory is not stored then the second learning should be impaired by NMDAr blockade. The results suggest amnesia of contextual fear memory caused by intra-dorsal hippocampus (dH) PSI infusion represents a storage impairment which gives a different result from extinction induced irretrievability. In the fifth manuscript , the aim is to identify the brain mechanism for the second learning as the previous manuscript suggests it is different from the first learning mechanism. The results show that the first, but not the second learning required voltage-dependent calcium channels and activation in dH. The second learning was impaired by intra-dH or ventral hippocampus (vH) inactivation only when the protein synthesis in the other portion of hippocampus was blocked after training. This suggests while the first learning by default requires dH, the second learning can be acquired through a functional dH or vH. In summary, this thesis extends memory research from consolidating a new learning to characterizing the reconsolidation of appetitive and overtrained memory to consolidating a second learning which will lead to a more complete description of memory process.</description><creator>Wang, Szu-Han, 1975-</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Memory.</subject><subject>Amnesia.</subject><subject>Memory -- Physiological aspects.</subject><title>Amnesia of reactivation, new learning and second learning</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Szu-Han Wang, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m039k9441.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7h149t78b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7s75dh63p</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:46:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Although audition may appear to be the dominant sensory modality in speech production, the capacity for intelligible speech following severe hearing loss suggests that other sensory information - for example, somatosensory feedback - may also contribute to the achievement of speech targets. The aim of this thesis is to explore the role of somatosensory feedback in speech produced by healthy adults. The first study aimed at providing a test of whether somatosensory feedback plays a role in speech production beyond the language acquisition period in early childhood. In order to achieve this goal, we designed a pattern of forces that affects jaw movements during speech production, but at the same time has no measurable acoustic effect. We found that subjects compensated for such a distortion in speech movement trajectories, even though it had no impact on the sounds. In contrast, no adaptation was observed in matched non-speech jaw movements, indicating that this was not an inevitable consequence of exposing the orofacial apparatus to this pattern of forces. This is the first demonstration that somatosensory information on its own drives the achievement of articulator positions in speech. In study one, it was observed that subjects only adapted to the loads in the opening phase of the jaw movement. In order to elucidate this somewhat unexpected finding, we carried out experiments in which we manipulated the linguistic content of the training utterance. We found that subjects compensated for the perturbations only in portions of the movement that contained a vowel-to-vowel transition. It was suggested that the required kinematic precision during a transition between two vocal tract shapes associated with vowels is higher than during transitions between a consonant and a vowel. It also points to the speech-like nature of the observed adaptation. The third study aimed at investigating the extent to which speech motor learning generalizes across acoustic contexts. We trained subjects to produce utterances while exposed to a velocity dependent force field. After learning, the subjects were tested with new utterances, matched on dynamics to the ones used in training. Note that even if the acoustic contents of the test and the training utterances were different, the loads had a similar effect on both speech movements. We showed that learning did not transfer to the test utterances; therefore adaptation was restricted to the specific training context. These results point to the specificity of speech motor learning.</description><creator>Tremblay, Stéphanie.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Speech.</subject><title>Force field adaptation in speech production</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Stéphanie Tremblay, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k643b535p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7s75dh63p</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5h73q120n</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:46:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Diacetyl (2,3-butanedione) is an important flavour active, oxidative compound that has significant impact on cellular health as well as financial impact in industrial fermentations. The presence of diacetyl in certain fermented beverages, such as beer, results in an unpleasant butterscotch-like flavour and its concentration needs to be reduced by yeast to below the taste threshold prior to filtration and packaging. This results in significant process inefficiency. Furthermore, diacetyl negatively impacts cellular health and has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases and general cell aging amongst others. The reduction of this compound is therefore essential for cellular health. Several yeast cell enzymatic mechanisms responsible for diacetyl reduction were identified and characterised, including Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) isoforms and D-Arabinose Dehydrogenase (ARA1). OYE isoforms displayed different micromolar affinities and catalytic turnover rates for diacetyl and catalysed diacetyl reduction in a biphasic manner. ARA1 catalysed diacetyl reduction in a monophasic manner with a millimolar Michaelis constant. Knowledge gained in these studies was applied in investigations of diacetyl production and reduction in industrial brewing operations and the enzymatic systems further exploited for the development of a novel enzyme based assay to determine diacetyl concentrations in beer samples. Concentrations as low as 0.2 muM were detectable with high repeatability.</description><creator>Van Bergen, Barry.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Methyl ethyl ketone.</subject><subject>Diacetyl.</subject><subject>Beer industry.</subject><subject>Brewing.</subject><subject>Saccharomyces cerevisiae -- Biotechnology.</subject><title>Diacetyl : identification and characterisation of molecular mechanisms for reduction in yeast and their application in a novel enzyme based assay for quantification in fermentation systems</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Barry Van Bergen, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nk322j886.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5h73q120n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Bioresource Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):37850</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
