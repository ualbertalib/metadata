In discussing their investigation of the pyrolysis of methane, ethane, ethylene and acetylene, at 500° to 1200° C, they were led to postulate the "momentary formation and separate existence of such 'residues' as CH, :CH2 and possibly also .CH3" and the subsequent hydrogenation of these to methane by the hydrogen present.</description><creator>Gartaganis, Phoebus.

It is the paradox of the literary achievement of George Bernard Shaw (1856-1950), and it may be described as follows:- During his most productive years as a playwright, from 1892 until the period immediately following World War l, Shaw was not considered a "dramatist" by a number of the influential critics of the London theatre (although these critics were generally charitable enough to admit that Shaw was an "entertaining," "amusing," and in some respects even a "serious" writer).</description><creator>Friend, Gregory.</creator><contributor>Porter, S.

Food substances, on the other hand, were thought to be rapidly used up and their residues excreted. The use of isotopes soon indicated that the elements comprising all parts or the body had a rate of turnover which varied somewhat, but was often much higher than expected.

As a result of these studies, a number of new compounds of this type have already been introduced as therapeutic agents. The drugs in this series are of special pharmacological interest because of the wide scope of physiological functions which they have been reported to affect, and this is particularly so in respect to the chlorophenothiazine derivative, known as chlorpromazlne.</description><creator>Drapeau, Jacqueline.

L'idéologie traditionnelle encourageait par des règles objectives les relations de soutien interpersonnel, isolait l'individu l'intérieur de frontières étanches et Ie soumettait  la discipline communautaire. Vers 1900, un renouveau religieux vint affaiblir ces frontières en introduisant Ie choix d'un salut par dévotion personnelle plutôt que par obéissance règles communautaires. Des 1950, la mécanisation des fermes et leur richesse augmentèrent les contacts avec Ie monde extérieur, surtout par Ie travail salarie et la consommation. Ces nouveaux développements, anormaux pour l'idéologie traditionnelle, vinrent appuyer l'idéal du renouveau religieux et en assurer finalement la domination. Reprenant la these de Kuhn, cette étude montre comment des expériences individuelles nouvelles,  la suite d'une ouverture des frontières de la communauté, ont résolu Ie débat entre idéologies concurrentielles.</description><description>In explaining modernization in an Ontario Amish Mennonite community, this thesis follows Kuhn's model of change in the sciences, detailing especially the interaction of internal religious ideology with outside events. An ambiguous traditional ideology promoted supportive interpersonal relations through objective rules, isolating the individual behind tight boundaries, subordinating him to community discipline. Revivalism, however, introduced an alternative early in the 1900's-salvation through individual piety, not community ru1es-and opened boundaries. By the 1950's, prosperity and farm mechanization led to increasingly modernized outside contact for individuals, through wage labour and consumer purchases. Anomalous under traditional ideology, these experiences supported the revivalist ideal, and led to its eventual domination. Kuhn explains transformation through the interaction of scientific theory and independent phenomena; we show how new individualized experiences arising when ideological debate opened boundaries resolved questions about the validity of competing ideologies.</description><creator>Laurence, Hugh</creator><contributor>Arcand, Bernard (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1980</date><subject>Ontario -- Social conditions.</subject><subject>Amish -- Ontario -- Social conditions.</subject><title>Change in religion, economics, and boundary conditions among Amish Mennonites in Southwestern Ontario</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2514nq32z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zk51vm95c</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anthropology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sb397d249</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:36:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A flow apparatus was designed for the experimental investigation of ignition delays of various fuels injected into a hot pure air stream of temperatures up to 1350°K. Results for the four gaseous paraffins are given for various gas flows and two air flows. It was found that the ignition delays increase with the gas flow and decrease with air flow. The activation energy of the reactions was computed from the straight part of the curves plotted where the effect of the time required for the mixture formation is small. The whole spontaneous ignition problem is described qualitatively and the problems involved are pointed out.</description><creator>Dodis, Nicholas. G.</creator><contributor>Mordell, D.

For example, a patient who has had an arm or leg amputated may continue to "feel" the absent limb long after it has been removed. Operations for the removal of cataracts are often complicated by visual hallucinations or delirium. A lesion in the visual pathways which immediately impairs only a portion of the field of vision may produce mild hallucinations with altered functioning or the intact visual areas. These disorders have a common feature, namely, that the central nervous system is being deprived of a former source of the normal and varying patterns of stimulation from the environment.</description><creator>Doane, Benjamin.

Pulse by pulse records of the signal received from snow at a vertical-pointing radar have been obtained. The records have been analyzed to give the autocorrelation coefficient, p (t), as a function of time; p (t) was found to decrease from 1.0 to 0.5 in from 2 to 15 milliseconds. By means of the Wiener - Khintchine Theorem, the rate of decrease of p (t) has been related to the total effect of sedimentation and turbulence upon the snowflakes.</description><creator>Dennis, Arnett.

He himself believed that only his poetry and, perhaps, ‘Hypatia’ would survive, but time has decided differently. His poems are now largely forgotten and his social novels retain an attraction or interest mainly for the student of sociology. But ‘Westward Ho!’ and ‘Hypatia’ are as fresh and lively to-day as they were almost a hundred years ago, although they are now considered books for children rather than novels for the mature reader.</description><creator>Dedering, Christa.

From previous publications it had been verified that methyl groups adjacent to activating groups, such as tertiary nitrogens in heterocyclic rings or amino groups in general, are capable of undergoing oxidation with selenium dioxide to the corresponding carbonyl or carboxylic group. Although work had been previously carried out on mono-methylpyridines the results obtained seemed to be unreliable. Therefore it was first decided to reinvestigate their oxidation.</description><creator>DeSouza, John. E.</creator><contributor>Taurins, A.

The theory predicts that the electrostatic effect of thermal vibrations is the chief contribution to the temperature coefficient of the work function, all other contributions being either negligible or cancelling. Agreement between theory and experiment was obtained from observations made on silver and copper films but not from less reliable measurements made on gold films. Measurements were taken over the temperature range 300°K to 800°K using a capacitive contact potential method.</description><creator>Crowell, Clarence. R.</creator><contributor>Woonton, G.
