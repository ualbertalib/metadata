They are negatively regulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Cdc42-GTPase-Activating Protein (CdGAP) is a negative regulator of the Rho GTPases Rad and Cdc42, whose aberrant signaling is involved in pathological processes such as tumorigenesis and metastasis. In this study, we set out to identify regulatory mechanisms of CdGAP. We show that CdGAP exists as a long isoform of 1425 amino acids in addition to the shorter 820 amino acid isoform that was previously described. We also identify RSK-1, ERK1 and GSK-3 as interacting partners of CdGAP, with ERK1 and GSK-3 interacting with the proline-rich domain (PRD) of CdGAP, a region known to be necessary for CdGAP regulation. We characterize the phosphorylation of CdGAP and show that in vivo CdGAP is mostly phosphorylated on serine residues. RSK-1, ERK1 and GSK-3 are all able to phosphorylate CdGAP in the PRD, and, in the case of ERK1 and GSK-3, we have identified Thr-776 as a site phosphorylated by both kinases. The site can be phosphorylated in vivo, and its phosphorylation leads to decreased CdGAP activity. We have also identified a novel potential mechanism of RhoGAP protein regulation, namely the serum-induced upregulation of CdGAP mRNA levels. We characterize the mechanism by which this occurs and demonstrate that Rho GTPase activity is necessary for this upregulation to occur. In summary, we have identified and characterized novel regulatory mechanisms for CdGAP, a negative regulator of Rac1 and Cdc42.</description><creator>Danek, Eric Ian.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3 -- metabolism.</subject><subject>cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Phosphorylation.</subject><subject>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 -- metabolism.</subject><subject>GTPase-Activating Proteins -- metabolism.</subject><title>Characterization of regulatory mechanisms of CdGAP, a negative regulator of the small GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3t945v45m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9c67wr40n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:v118rh99p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:35Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The information processing theory of problem solving has emphasized search and heuristics and comparatively neglected learning, a situation that this thesis addresses. Participants learn to solve problems using environmental feedback, verbal instructions, or demonstrations performed by experts. Empirical and simulation work confirms that demonstrations and instructions are more effective for learning than binary feedback (answer correct or not). Results also show that humans successfully generalize what they learn by observation to more complex tasks, suggesting understanding rather than rote memorizing of the solutions observed. Four computational models of complex problem solving are presented. First, a reinforcement learning model is trained on binary environmental rewards only (RL-SDCC-SARSA) to simulate the binary reinforcement condition. It can learn the task with enough training but is less accurate than humans given equivalent learning. We argue that this is evidence that humans may be using distance to goal, look-ahead search, and reasoning. Second, a supervised cascade-correlation neural network (SL-SDCC) model learning from demonstrations successfully captures human accuracy in the imitation learning group. Third, a reinforcement-based model with direct policy training (RL-SDCC-DPT) learning from demonstrations also captures imitation learning group accuracy. Finally, a supervised knowledge-based cascade-correlation (SL-KBCC) model with selection rules as prior knowledge successfully captures performance of the verbal instructions group. This model builds more compact networks than SL-SDCC that also train faster. All four models presented use cascade-correlation networks, which are either trained directly (SL-SDCC and SL-KBCC) or used as function approximators for expected rewards (RL-SDCC-DPT and RL-SDCC-SARSA). In the latter models, a second layer involves learning target expected rewards. SARSA converts environmental rewards into target rewards, and direct policy training (DPT) converts demonstrations into target rewards. Reinforcement-based models are more complex and costly to train than supervised systems, but they cover more cognitive phenomena in a single unified and parsimonious system, including the use of problem variants, exploration, and working memory limitations. Promising ideas are proposed to extend reinforcement-based models: distance-based rewards (DBR), which involve using distance to goal as a self-generated reward; look-ahead search; and intrinsic exploration by adding randomness to the action selection system.</description><creator>Dandurand, Frédéric.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Machine learning.</subject><subject>Problem solving.</subject><title>Computational modeling of learning in complex problem solving tasks</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n296x279s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v118rh99p</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6d570115b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:36Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Epilepsy is a common and heterogeneous neurological disorder affecting approximately 1.0% of the general population. In up to 65% of cases, the etiology could not be demonstrated (idiopathic). Based on familial aggregation and twin studies, genetic factors are believed to play an important role in idiopathic epilepsies. Recently, familial forms of epilepsies have been identified, and mutations in specific genes predisposing to these rare forms of monogenic epilepsies were uncovered. In this thesis, identification of mutations in three different genes is described, including a D188V mutation in the alpha1 subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel (SCN1A) associated with generalized epilepsy with febrile seizure, plus; an A322D mutation in the alpha1 subunit of the GABAA receptor in an autosomal dominant form of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy; and a Q555X mutation in synapsin 1 (SYN1) in a recessive X-linked temporal lobe epilepsy. Preliminary functional studies on each of these mutation suggested altered function of the mutated genes, suggesting that these mutations are indeed pathogenic. Also, detailed clinical characterization of the SYN1Q555X mutation carriers revealed that affected males and females respectively exhibit developmental language disorder and dyslexia. Considering that individuals with mutated SCN1A may also exhibit mental retardation, these data suggest that mutations in epilepsy genes may also predispose to impaired cognition. The identification of such molecular mechanisms underlying monogenic epilepsies should eventually help to improve the treatment of this chronic and debilitating disorder, and will provide food for a revised, molecular-based, classification of the epileptic syndromes.</description><creator>Cossette, Patrick, 1970-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Epilepsy -- genetics.</subject><subject>Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe -- genetics.</subject><subject>Myoclonic Epilepsy, Juvenile -- genetics.</subject><subject>Epilepsy, Generalized -- genetics.</subject><subject>Epilepsy -- classification.</subject><title>Genetic and molecular mechanisms of monogenic epilepsies</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z890rz15n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6d570115b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Human Genetics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:f7623h14s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The objective of this thesis research project is to provide a complete, systematic characterization of spatial image cross-correlation spectroscopy (ICCS) for its use in quantifying molecular interactions via analysis of fluorescence microscopy images. In spatial ICCS, cross-correlation of fluctuations in fluorescence intensity recorded as images from two independent wavelength detection channels in a fluorescence microscope is used to determine the average number of interacting particles in a sample. Other statistical image analysis methods exist that can be performed on fluorescence microscopy images of fixed or live cells and have been routinely applied for biophysical studies of molecular interaction. These approaches measure the fraction of interacting particles by analyzing fluorescence images from two detection channels for colocalized pixels. Colocalization algorithms have been widely used, although the dynamic range and accuracy of these measurements has never been well established. Using computer simulations, control experiments of fluorescently labeled antibodies adsorbed on glass, and cell measurements, we show that ICCS is more accurate than standard colocalization algorithms at moderate to high densities of particles, which are often encountered in cellular systems. Furthermore, it was found that the density ratio between the two labeled species of interest plays a major role in the accuracy of the colocalization analysis. By applying a direct and systematic comparison between the standard, fluorescence microscopy colocalization algorithms and spatial ICCS, we show regimes where each approach is applicable, and more importantly, where they fail to yield accurate results. Spatial ICCS was then used to measure a 4-fold increase in the dissociation rate of phosphorylated AP-2/beta-arrestin complexes, important regulatory proteins of G protein-coupled receptors in living cells. New approaches to improve ICCS were also studied. Spatial scrambling of pixel blocks within fluorescence images was investigated as a way of extending the detection of two-channel ICCS to measure lower interaction fractions as well as colocalization within large structures. ICCS theory was also extended to handle the analysis of systems with multiple ligand-binding sites.</description><creator>Comeau, Jonathan W.

However, space motion sickness (SMS) could be hazardous for an entire crew if an astronaut experiences severe symptoms while rapid and precise manoeuvres have to be performed. Thus, there is a need for a reliable predictive test, an effective pre-adaptation method or a fully acceptable treatment. Unfortunately, none of these exist at this time. In part, this is because so little is known about the mechanisms underlying MS. There have been numerous attempts to predict who will develop SMS and to pre-adapt astronauts before flight. Most have been relatively unsuccessful. This can be explained by the sensory conflict theory of MS, which suggests that adaptation to one type of motion is highly specific and not transferable to a different type of motion. In the present thesis, I describe a series of experiments that studied a fundamentally different way of causing MS and tested if it might be used to predict or prevent SMS. The new method used excessive vestibular suppression to temporarily alter the central processing of otherwise normal vestibular inputs. Depending on whether these inputs originated in the semicircular canals or otolith organs, it was possible to predict susceptibility to a ground-based model of SMS and to reduce susceptibility to the same model, at least in some individuals. The transfer of adaptation may be based on a form of sensory re-weighting.</description><creator>Cloutier, Annie.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Space Motion Sickness -- physiopathology.</subject><subject>Reflex, Vestibulo-Ocular -- physiology.</subject><subject>Vestibular Nuclei -- physiology.</subject><title>Vestibular suppression and space motion sickness</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tt44pr41p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/41687m791</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physiology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3484zm36p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis presents methods for quantitative MRI analysis of brain injury, repair and degeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS) that provide new insights into disease pathogenesis and evolution. Demyelinated and inflammatory white-matter lesions are hallmark features of MS. A methodology is described to detect regions of acute white-matter lesions that undergo myelin destruction and repair based on analysis of magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) images. Validation is performed based on histopathology and error is assessed based on same-day scans. To quantify the spatial extent and temporal evolution of myelin destruction and repair, data from a 3-year clinical trial is analyzed using this method. Approximately 20% of acute lesion voxels show some repair over the initial 7 months. In subsequent months, there is little further repair, but some increases in the lesion volume undergoing demyelination. Although less conspicuous on conventional MRI, there is considerable MS pathology in the brain tissue outside of white-matter lesions. An image-processing methodology was developed to obtain accurate metrics that quantify change over time in whole-brain MTR (associated with changes in myelin-density) and in T2 relaxation time (associated with changes in inflammatory edema). These metrics, in addition to metrics of brain atrophy and axonal integrity, were used to quantify brain injury and degeneration following immunoablation and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation therapy for MS. Pronounced brain volume loss was detected immediately following therapy, associated with decreased myelin density and not resolution of edema. Post-mortem histopathology has revealed abnormalities in the cortical grey-matter of MS patients that appear to be independent of white-matter lesions. A methodology to quantify neocortical injury and degeneration that yields cross-sectional and longitudinal metrics of cortical thickness and grey-matter/white-matter interface integrity both globally and regionally is presented and validated. MS patients with progressive disability showed greater decreases in cortical metrics compared to MS patients with stable disability. The quantitative MRI analysis methods presented in this thesis are applicable to MRI data obtained in clinical trials of therapies for MS, have the necessary sensitivity and specificity to assess therapeutic efficacy, and provide new insights into disease pathogenesis and evolution.</description><creator>Chen, Jacqueline T., 1973-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Image Processing, Computer-Assisted.</subject><subject>Multiple Sclerosis -- pathology.</subject><subject>Myelin Sheath -- pathology.</subject><subject>Magnetic Resonance Imaging -- methods.</subject><title>Image-processing of MRI for measuring brain injury, repair and degeneration in patients with multiple sclerosis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3n204269n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3484zm36p</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biomedical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5138jj12h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Deep sub-micron (DSM) integration brings about aggressive technology scaling to accommodate large and high-speed systems onto a single chip. The integration and migration of mixed-signal systems to smaller process nodes have shortened the traditional analog circuit design cycle and increases performance influence due to parasitic coupling. Current analog optimization tools demonstrate promising results at the schematic netlist-level, but inherited layout effects are excluded until the physical design is completed. If coupling effects are ignored or poorly modeled, schematic optimization results are no longer accurate with respect to silicon measurements. On the other hand, physical design tools are traditionally guided by geometric constraints. In interconnect-dominated designs, both parasitic-aware circuit optimization and performance-driven physical design are crucial for rapid design closure. This thesis addresses both issues by integrating schematic optimization and the physical design process. Through the use of virtual interconnect parasitic models and light-weight parasitic models, the simulation-based circuit optimizers and placement tools can exchange design and performance information while operating at their full capacities. The interconnect models also provide provisional routing configurations. A novel compaction process for analog layout further refines the block and interconnect positions with respect to DSM effects.</description><creator>Chan, Henry H.

The first relates to inference for the mean function, the second to inference for the covariance function. We propose a modification to the Gaussian random field (GRF) theory for computing the p-value of a supra-threshold test when there are departures from normality in the data. Specifically, we derive a saddlepoint approximation to the expected Euler characteristic (EC) of the excursion set at a level u &gt; 0 of a normalized sum of n i.i.d. stationary random fields. We show that as u and n grow simultaneously, the 'tilted' approximation is asymptotically more accurate than a simple Gaussian assumption. We illustrate the improvement using data from astrophysics, cognitive psychology ('bubbles') and brain mapping. In the 'bubbles' setting we perform a simulation to ascertain the accuracy of the tilted expected EC as a p-value approximation. We also present a geometric interpretation for the formula, which suggests an asymptotic generalization of Jonathan Taylor's Gaussian Kinematic Formula (GKF) [86]. We then treat the problem of inference for the principal component (PC) or eigenimages of the covariance function of GRF data. Approximate p-values for thresholding tests of PC random fields have proved elusive due to a lack of useful results about the (finite-dimensional) distribution(s) of such processes. We take a Bayesian approach, discretize the problem, and formulate a parsimonious hierarchical model for the covariance structure of the process. The model is based on that of Smith &amp; Kohn [75] but includes several modifications for improved stability, computational efficiency and sampling speed. It also involves a sparsity parameter modeled a priori as a Markov random field. We devise a simulation study to calibrate the model with generic GRF data and also test it using real data from neuroimaging and remote sensing applications.</description><creator>Chamandy, Nicholas.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Principal components analysis.</subject><subject>Gaussian processes.</subject><subject>Random fields.</subject><title>Inference for asymptotically Gaussian random fields</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j96024548.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tb09j892w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rx913t447</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Folates are essential cofactors that are required for the synthesis of nucleotides, the precursors of DNA and RNA. Two widely used anti-metabolite chemotherapeutic drugs, anti-folate methotrexate (MTX) and the pyrimidine antagonist 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), inhibit DNA and RNA synthesis and induce apoptosis, through their effects on the folate pathway. A common polymorphism (677C→T) in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), a critical folate-metabolizing enzyme in nucleotide synthesis, may modify the chemosensitivity of MTX and 5-FU. In this thesis, two mouse models (a well-characterized mouse model deficient in MTHFR (Mthfr-/- and Mthfr +/-) and a new mouse model that overexpresses MTHFR (MTHFR-Tg )) were used to investigate the effect of MTHFR expression on response to MTX and 5-FU. The latter mouse model, MTHFR-Tg, was generated and characterized in this thesis. MTHFR-Tg mice had an increase in methionine in brain, a decrease in cysteine in duodenum, an increase in glutathione in liver and decreases in 10-formyltetrahydrofolate levels in liver and duodenum. Mthfr-deficient and MTHFR-Tg mice and their wild-type littermates were injected with MTX or 5-FU (with saline as a control) and assessed for hematological parameters (hematocrit, hemoglobin, red and white blood cell numbers), plasma homocysteine levels, serum nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity markers, splenic dUTP/dTTP ratios and apoptosis. MTHFR overexpression increased the effect of MTX on hematopoietic cells, through reduced DNA synthesis and deoxyribonucleotide imbalance (higher dUTP/dTTP ratios)-induced splenic apoptosis, with a protection against MTX-induced hyperhomocysteinemia. MTHFR deficiency had similar effects on MTX-treated hematopoietic cells, through hyperhomocysteinemia-induced splenic apoptosis, with enhanced MTX-induced hyperhomocysteinemia and nephrotoxicity. Furthermore, in transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts, MTHFR overexpression was protective against MTX-induced apoptosis, possibly through its protective effect against hyperhomocysteinemia. Lastly, MTHFR overexpression enhanced 5-FU-induced leucopoenia and splenic apoptosis while reducing plasma Hcy levels. The major problem with MTX and 5-FU therapies is the variability in therapeutic outcome and toxicity which is the primary reason for discontinuation of therapy. Our studies illustrate the critical effect of MTHFR expression on the chemosensitivity to MTX and 5-FU, and the importance of pharmacogenetic testing for the MTHFR polymorphism and possibly polymorphisms in other folate-metabolizing enzymes to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity.</description><creator>Celtikci, Basak.</creator><contributor>Rozen, Rima (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2008</date><subject>Immunosuppression.</subject><subject>Fluorouracil -- pharmacology.</subject><subject>Methotrexate -- pharmacology.</subject><subject>Mice.</subject><subject>Mice, Knockout.</subject><subject>Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide.</subject><subject>Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2) -- genetics.</subject><title>Altered expression of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase modifies response to methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil in mice</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8g84mr01j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rx913t447</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Human Genetics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xw42nc459</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The sub-nanosecond dynamics of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) are studied in conditions of high fields and low temperatures. Three main regimes are identified. Firstly, the propagation of sub-nanosecond, or GHz, signals in a 2DEG waveguide at low temperature (2 K) and high magnetic field (9 T). Here we show that the 2DEG waveguide can be fully parameterised by the Hall resistance and a new 'microwave scaling constant'. Secondly, the physics of plasmons confined at the edge and in a magnetic field (9 T): edge magnetoplasmons (EMPs). Here we resolve multiple plasmon modes, where as well as the standard EMP resonances, we discover additional lower frequency modes, which could be related to transverse acoustic excitations. Thirdly, tunneling into microwave induced resistance oscillation (MIRO) states at low temperatures (50 mK). By using a novel cleaved edge overgrown (CEO) technique we are able to identify the role of photon assisted tunneling (PAT) in the formation of MIROs. These experimental results were obtained by developing new techniques combining microwaves, low temperatures, 2DEGs and high magnetic fields, which required the design and fabrication of several novel probes for these regimes.</description><creator>Armstrong-Brown, Alistair.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Magnetic fields.</subject><subject>Electromagnetic fields.</subject><subject>Electron gas.</subject><subject>Quantum Hall effect.</subject><title>Sub-nanosecond dynamics in low-dimensional systems</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gt54kr604.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xw42nc459</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xs55mg495</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This work presents mathematical properties of the RSA cryptosystem. The topics of backdoors and padding algorithm are developped. For padding schemes, we give a practical instantiation with a security reduction. It is based on the compression function of SHA-1 without any chaining function. Our solution has the advantage over the previous one of removing the relation of the output length of the compression function to the length of the RSA modulus. For backdoors, improvements on definitions, existing algorithms as well as extensions of existing theorems are shown. The definitions pertaining to backdoored key generators are improved as to make their analysis uniform and comparable. New algorithms are presented and compared to existing ones as to show improvements mainly on their running time, the indistinguishability of the keys produced, and that some of these new algorithms are, for all practical purposes, the best that may be called asymmetric. Our theorem on the correctness (or completeness) of one of our better backdoored key generators is a generalization of a theorem of Boneh, Durfee and Frankel's on partial information on the decryption exponent.</description><creator>Arboit, Geneviève.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Coding theory.</subject><subject>Public key cryptography.</subject><title>Two mathematical security aspects of the RSA cryptosystem : signature padding schemes and key generation with a backdoor</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t722hd34p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xs55mg495</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7h149t23r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A review of the literature indicates a facilitative effect of emotional content on communicative abilities in aphasia, including discourse production (e.g., Bloom, Borod, Obler, &amp; Gerstman, 1992; Bloom, Borod, Santschi-Haywood, Pick, &amp; Obler, 1996; Landis, Graves, &amp; Goodglass, 1982; Ramsberger, 1979; Reuterskioeld, 1991). To explore how emotional content influences discourse-level pragmatic features in narratives produced by Arabic-speaking adults with aphasia, Grice's (1975) pragmatic framework for discourse analysis was adopted. The primary question addressed by the current study was whether or not discourse elicited using stimuli with emotional content (positive or negative) is superior in quantity, quality, relevance, and manner than that elicited using non-emotional content (neutral) in an aphasia group and a healthy group of adults. Two experiments were conducted. The first experiment was designed to determine the appropriateness of the testing stimuli---a set of video-clips that had been purposefully constructed for this study. The goal was to ensure that each video-clip met specific requirements with regard to valence category, emotional intensity, logical sequence, and interest level. A group of young healthy adults narrated the events portrayed in the clips and completed an emotionality judgment questionnaire about the clips. Results of the stimulus validation experiment guided the selection of a subset of nine video-clips---three clips per emotional category: positive, negative, and neutral---that were utilized in the main experiment. In the main experiment, discourse was elicited from a group of adults with aphasia and normal controls using the video-clips. Samples were analyzed for pragmatic features using six measures: amount of production and communicative efficiency to assess discourse quantity; accuracy of production to assess discourse quality; coherence to assess discourse manner; and lexical selection and topic maintenance to assess discourse relevance. Results indicated that emotional content positively influenced performance on the majority of pragmatic variables. Results also revealed that adults with aphasia were less appropriate than normal controls on the majority of discourse measures under investigation. The findings are discussed in relation to current models of emotional, cognitive, and language processing.</description><creator>Alasseri, Areej.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Verbal Behavior.</subject><subject>Linguistics -- methods.</subject><subject>Aphasia.</subject><subject>Emotions.</subject><title>Influence of emotionality on pragmatic features of discourse produced by Arabic-speaking adults with aphasia</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cf95jf77z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7h149t23r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Communication Sciences and Disorders</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2227mt49w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A technique was developed to study the effect of surfactant (frother) on individual bubble motion in swarms. The technique was based on high speed cinematography and tracking of multiple moving objects. Image processing algorithms were implemented in Matlab to isolate and measure geometric properties of the bubbles in image sequences recorded at 1 ms interval; and these properties were compiled into a data structure. To track a bubble, the geometric properties and a matching criterion were applied on consecutive pictures to identify the bubble. The bubble trajectory was reconstructed from the data structure for the matched objects. To maximize the number of bubbles identified from an image, de-clustering algorithms were developed and validated. A new shape factor model for ellipsoidal objects and a correction model for pixelation effect were developed. To characterize the level of bubble interaction in a swarm, a technique for measuring average dimensionless bubble inter-distance was developed. To characterize the effect of frother type on bubble surface a new technique for measuring surface flows (Marangoni effect) on a bubble blown in air was developed. The results provided experimental evidence of the mechanisms by which surfactants dampen bubble oscillation and reduce bubble terminal rise velocity and helped to interpret the frother type effect. Experiments to determine the effect of surfactant (concentration and type), bubble interactions and bubble size distribution type on bubble velocity in swarms were conducted using the bubble tracking technique in a rectangular transparent column (12x5x140 cm) with an inclined top section (15°). A flat bubble swarm was generated combining a slot (60 mm x 60 microm) and porous-slot (60 x 1.1 mm) spargers. These combinations allowed the generation of bubble size distributions similar to those in industrial flotation machines. Bubble images were collected at three locations (near the point of generation, the top of the straight section and in the inclined section) to track the impact of surfactant accumulation. The results showed that the presence of surfactant reduced bubble coalescence and breakage and stabilized the bubble surface. As a consequence, the bubble size distribution remained stable as the swarm rose. Experimental measurements of bubble motion in the presence of surfactants showed for both single bubbles and swarms, that surfactant accumulation occurs as the bubbles detach from the generating point, and the impact occurs gradually, determined by the subsequent evolution of bubble aspect ratio. The bubble tracking measurements revealed a velocity-size profile, which was determined by: the predominant bubble size class, bubble interactions (dimensionless bubble inter-distance), and the surfactant type and concentration. The surfactant type seems to be a factor in determining bubble rise velocity for bubbles below 0.8 mm, despite the theory that surface mobility for such small bubbles in unaffected by surfactants. It is thus proposed that surface viscosity plays a role on bubble motion. The new techniques for bubble motion and surface characterization were tested for bubble swarms in presence of Polyglycol and Pentanol. Two contributions to the knowledge emerging from this phase of the work are: (a) bubble motion in swarm describes a bubble velocity-size profile with a high dependency on the bubble distribution type, and (b) surfactant type influences bubble rise velocity for bubbles in range 0.1 to 4 mm.</description><creator>Acuña Pérez, Claudio Abraham.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Bubbles -- Dynamics -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Image processing -- Digital techniques -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Flotation.</subject><subject>Image analysis -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Surface active agents.</subject><title>Measurement techniques to characterize bubble motion in swarms</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/736668309.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2227mt49w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fb494c87m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Plant sterol-containing food products are known to reduce low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, with the degree of placebo-adjusted reduction ranging from 5% to 15%. Factors that affect plant sterol efficacy such as the type of formulation and dosing frequency are still to be determined. Thus, the objective of this thesis was to investigate the impact of novel plant sterol preparations, frequency of intake and time of intake of plant sterols on cholesterol kinetics and/or plasma lipid profile. Three randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind, crossover, supervised feeding trials were conducted in 75 subjects with LDL levels of &gt; 3.0 mmol/L. The results from the 3 studies showed that: (i) traditional forms of plant sterols did not reduce LDL levels when given as a single morning dose, thus the efficacy of the novel formulation of plant sterols could not be confirmed; (ii) consumption of 1.8 g/d of plant sterols equally distributed over the day lowered LDL, whereas the consumption of the same dose once a day with breakfast did not lower LDL levels, in spite of a reduction in cholesterol absorption efficiency; (iii) cholesterol fractional synthesis rate (FSR) increased when plant sterols were consumed 3 times/d, but not as a single morning dose, which could be attributed to feedback upregulation of cholesterol FSR in response to reduced cholesterol absorption; and (iv) no overall reduction in LDL levels were observed when a 1.6 g/d of single dose of plant sterols provided in yoghurt was consumed with breakfast or dinner; however, a reduction in LDL was observed in subjects with low baseline cholesterol absorption efficiency irrespective of time of intake. Furthermore, we performed a meta-analysis to further identify any factors that could affect the efficacy of plant sterols and the results demonstrated that: (i) consumption of plant sterols reduce LDL levels by 0.31 mmol/L; (ii) the reduction in LDL was greater in studies conducted on individuals with high baseline LDL levels; (iii) plant sterols incorporated into margarine, mayonnaise and salad dressing, milk and yogurt reduced LDL levels to greater extent than plant sterols incorporated into other food products; and (iv) plant sterols consumed as single dose in the morning did not reduce plasma LDL levels. In conclusion, the consumption of single morning dose of plant sterols may not be effective in reducing LDL levels, and that margarine, mayonnaise and salad dressing, milk and yoghurt are the best food carrier of plant sterols. In addition, subjects' baseline LDL levels and cholesterol absorption efficiency influence the response to plant sterols. Therefore, these findings could be used to improve plant sterol efficacy, as well as to establish future health claims.</description><creator>AbuMweis, Suhad Sameer.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Phytosterols.</subject><subject>Sterols -- Physiological effect.</subject><subject>Blood lipids.</subject><subject>Hypercholesteremia -- Treatment.</subject><title>The effects of formulation and dosing frequency of plant sterols on plasma lipid profiles and cholesterol kinetics parameters in hypercholesterolemic subjects /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3n204270d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fb494c87m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:v118rj007</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The high number of Giardia cyst polluting surface water, in conjunction with the inadequacy of current water treatment practices in ensuring the complete removal of giardial cysts, has led our group to propose the use of CWP2-based transmission-blocking vaccines as a mean to control environmental contamination by reducing the spread of infective Giardia cysts in nature. In this PhD thesis, three key studies were performed with the ultimate goal of developing and testing a CWP2-expressing transmission-blocking DNA vaccine in the mouse model of the disease. The study presented in manuscript I examined for the first time the host's local immune response to giardial cyst antigens (Ags) during the acute and elimination phases of a primary G. muris infection. The cyst Ags' specific immune response (which comprised a CWP2-specific component) was indistinguishable from the host's local immune response to trophozoite Ags. This local immune response included the production of a balanced IL-4/IFN-gamma cytokine response as well as intestinal IgA and IgG antibodies. Furthermore, this study showed for the first time the presence of local antibodies capable of interfering with the process of trophozoite encystation. These findings led us to advance the possibility that elimination of cyst shedding in a primary infection may be partly due to intestinal immune responses targeting encysting trophozoites. The study in manuscript II reported the expression of rCWP2 in transfected HEK-293 cells. Therein we showed that cwp2-transfected mammalian cells packaged the full-length CWP2 into membrane-bound vesicles and trafficked it via the secretory pathway, in a manner similar to encysting trophzoites. Analysis of CWP2 truncations expressed in transfected HEK-293 demonstrated that both the N- and C-termini were responsible for the secretion of CWP2. Based on these observations, we concluded that giardial CWPs can be successfully expressed in mammalian cells in addition to proposing the use of transfected HEK-293 cells as a heterologous model system to investigate the signal peptides involved in the intracellular trafficking of proteins in Giardia trophozoites. Finally, the study presented in manuscript III investigated the possible use of Salmonella typhimurium mediated bactofection for the delivery of the CWP2-encoding transmission-blocking DNA vaccine. The study showed that mice receiving the S. typhimurium-delivered CWP2-encoding oral DNA vaccine produced CWP2-specific intestinal immune responses similar to the CWP2-specific immune responses produced by Giardia-infected animals at the elimination phase of primary giardiasis. In addition, the administration of the CWP2-encoding transmission-blocking DNA vaccine resulted in significantly reducing the duration of cyst shedding in addition to reducing the total number of cysts shed. Taken together, these findings constitute original contributions to advancing our knowledge on the cyst Ag-specific component of the host's local immune response during an infection. Secondly, the findings show the usefulness of using transfected HEK-293 cells for performing comparative studies on protein trafficking with Giardia cells. Finally, the data also demonstrate the efficacy of STM1-mediated bactofection for delivering a CWP2-encoding DNA vaccine which led to interference with cyst formation in vivo .</description><creator>Abdul-Wahid, Aws.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Giardiasis -- Vaccination.</subject><subject>DNA vaccines.</subject><subject>Giardia lamblia.</subject><title>Development and evaluation of a cyst wall protein 2-encoding Giardia transmission-blocking DNA vaccine</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dn39x486b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v118rj007</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Parasitology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:b2774021m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The aim of this dissertation is to study a class of endogenous coalition formation problems with externalities where each agent's payoff depends not only on the coalition he or she belongs to but also how others partition themselves. This dissertation contains both theoretical and application elements. At the theoretical front (Chapter 1 and Chapter 2), two dynamic coalition formation games with endogenous choice of proposers are introduced. We prove that each game admits a dynamically efficient Markov perfect equilibrium. Moreover, we prove that the equilibrium payoff allocation of the game presented in Chapter 2 is unique. At the application front (Chapter 3), we design a negotiation mechanism to study dynamic processes of trading-bloc formation in an international trade model of imperfect competition where the formation of a free trade area (FTA) or a customs union (CU) imposes externalities on the outside countries. We show that in an n-heterogeneous-country model, global free trade is always achieved in equilibrium either sequentially or simultaneously. Therefore, neither FTAs nor CUs are stumbling blocs in our model. We illustrate using a three-country model with FTAs that global trade liberalization is attained immediately in equilibrium when externalities are high enough. In contrast, using another three-country model with CUs, we illustrate that global free trade is achieved sequentially when externalities are low enough. Furthermore, when externalities are moderate in both models, the way of attaining global free trade depends on the size of the common discount factor for all countries.</description><creator>Zhang, Lingling.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Trade blocs.</subject><subject>Coalitions -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Free trade.</subject><title>Endogenous coalition formation : theory and applications</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vt150n60p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b2774021m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Economics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5425kf28n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This project explores how early twentieth-century avant-garde poetic practice registers the experience of emergent technologies of the period. Drawing upon examples from both Anglo-American and Continental European avant-gardes, the dissertation considers how the widespread implementation of machine-age technologies such as the phonograph, the cinema, and the typewriter encouraged innovations essential to the development of a particular strand of avant-garde poetic practice. A period involving intense debate and theorization about modern versification, the first half of the twentieth century yielded updated techniques inspired by encounters between poetic practice and emergent technologies. Adapting machine-age technologies to their developing poetic theories and conventions, F. T. Marinetti, Ezra Pound, and Charles Olson reconceptualized the page, reinvigorated stagnant techniques, and advanced new principles in their critical idiom. Prompted by the example of new technologies, Marinetti and Olson reconceived existing poetic techniques in order to reflect the intensity of the poet's evolving creative activity on the page. Most often realized through a stylized graphic arrangement of aural stimuli, their poetics were informed by interactions with technologies such as the airplane and typewriter. Prompted by the Parisian cinematic avant-garde of the 1920s, Pound discovered a way to revive the inert principles of Vorticism in commentaries about cinematic projection and in formal procedures of cinematic representation. The accelerated Vorticist aesthetic afforded by his encounter with the creative processes of the cinema initiated the definitive design for his long poem, the Cantos. Arguing that these poets often subverted techniques associated with technologies to serve the objectives of an avant-garde creative practice rather than the tasks technologies had been designed to advance, this study asserts that the interplay between emergent technologies and poetic practice yields important insight into how a group of poets fused technological models and poetic strategies to introduce highly individualized formal and creative processes. Taking advantage of an early twenty-first century perspective that allows for a tempered view of the machine-age technologies to which these poets responded, the study concludes that Marinetti, Pound, and Olson were inspired by contact with emergent technologies to manipulate, transform, and renew existing methods of versification to assert an innovative avant-garde poetics.</description><creator>Wright, David N.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Marinetti, Filippo Tommaso, 1876-1944 -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><subject>Olson, Charles, 1910-1970 -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><subject>Machinery in literature.</subject><subject>Pound, Ezra, 1885-1972 -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><title>Subversive technologies : the machine age poetics of F.T.

Though originally designed to curb the attrition of novices, attention is now focusing on how these programs may affect student achievement and teacher development. While the components of such programs vary, one constant is the provision of an experienced colleague as a mentor. University professors, though involved in beginning teacher preparation, are rarely included in their ongoing support once they leave the institution. The present study attempts to discover a theoretical rationale for the involvement of university faculty in the support of beginning teachers. By analyzing documentary data, data from online interactions, and survey responses from beginning teachers, university faculty and mentor colleagues, such a theoretical framework was developed.</description><creator>Weber, David B., 1966-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Master teachers.</subject><subject>Teachers -- In-service training.</subject><title>A theoretical framework for induction : what university faculty have to offer to beginning teachers</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rv042x64h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gf06g6171</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2r36v209x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The library is an obsessional site in literary modernism. From the incendiary impulses of F. T. Marinetti to Walter Benjamin's sedate unpacking of his library, modernists characterize the library as a repository of the material past. In particular, Henry James, Edith Wharton, and E. M. Forster demonstrate a striking attunement to the materiality of books, archives, and libraries in their fiction. In The House of Mirth, books are aesthetic objects as well as commodities that advertise cultural capital. The contents of a private archive threaten public scandal in The Aspern Papers. Private libraries display cultural taste in Howards End and The Age of Innocence. With the rise of the public library movement, the obsolescence of the nineteenth-century private library, and the burning and blasting of books during warfare, these texts offered a renewed recognition that libraries and books, as metonyms of culture, are disputed objects. Modernist novels reflect a crisis in which bibliophilia encounters biblioclasm. A genuine appreciation of the past, embodied in the compulsions of reading, writing, editing, and collecting books, belies the desire to be unburdened of material relics. Profound engagement with the past marks modern fiction. James, Wharton, and Forster, as well as Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, and Evelyn Waugh, figure the reading of classics as a prerequisite to writing them. The bibliophilia that grips characters manifests the modernists' preoccupation with cultural heritage. Thus the past intrudes on libraries, sometimes in violent ways. Falling books crush Leonard Bast in Howards End. In Woolf's Orlando, books flood the front hall of a bibliophile who orders "the whole of Victorian literature" from a London bookseller. Reading is an enthralling but potentially dangerous activity. Confronted by rows of ageless classics, the modern writer is haunted by the spectre of literary influence in the library. In this regard, James, Wharton, and Forster revive Swift's "battle of the books." The modernists' jealous custody of the past and their keen sense of property contradict their resentment about guardianship and their desire to be dispossessed of the past.</description><creator>Stephenson, Liisa.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Modernism (Literature)</subject><subject>Books and reading.</subject><title>Reading matter : modernism and the book</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g158bm998.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36v209x</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0v838412z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>There is currently a shortage of science teachers in North America and continually decreasing rates of enrollment in science programs. Science continues to be the academic domain that sees the highest attrition rates, particularly for women. The purpose of the present study was to examine male and female students' experiences in mathematics and science courses during a crucial time in their academic development in an attempt to explain the high attrition rates in science between the last year of high school and the first year of CEGEP (junior college). In line with self-determination theory (Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985), as well as achievement-goal theory (Pintrich &amp; Schunk, 1996) and research on academic emotions, the study examined the relation between a set of motivational variables (i.e., perceptions of autonomy-support, self-efficacy, achievement goals, and intrinsic motivation), affect, achievement, and persistence. A secondary objective was to test a motivational model of student persistence in science using structural equation modeling (SEM). The sample consisted of 603 male and 706 female students from four English-language CEGEPs in the greater Montreal area. Just prior to beginning CEGEP, participants completed a questionnaire that asked about the learning environment in high school mathematics and science classes as well as student characteristics including sources of motivation, personal achievement goals, and feelings of competence. All students expressed an initial interest in pursuing a career in science by enrolling in optional advanced mathematics and science courses during high school. Multivariate analysis of variance was used to examine differences among male and female students across the variables measured. Structural equation modeling was used to test the validity of a questionnaire designed specifically to gather information about CEGEP students' experiences with mathematics and science, and to evaluate the fit of a model designed to reflect the interactions between the different variables. Students' experiences during high school have an impact on their decisions to pursue or abandon their path toward an eventual science career. Classroom experiences and student characteristics interact to influence their performance and affect, which in turn influence their decisions. Implications for promoting persistence in science are discussed.</description><creator>Simon, Rebecca A.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Motivation in education -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><subject>Science -- Study and teaching (Higher) -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><title>Exploring persistence in science in CEGEP : toward a motivational model</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pk02cf452.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0v838412z</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6q182p719</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>There are significant indications that a transformation has occurred in the organization of research and post-graduate training in the biomedical sciences in Canada over the last few decades. A typical academic lab in the 1960s was small: a professor, maybe a technician, and perhaps a graduate student or two. However, many labs now have twenty or more members, most of which are graduate students and post-doctoral researchers. Changes in social organization of academic labs during this period and the reasons they occurred have not been systematically studied. Nor has the relationship between the social organization of research and research funding, despite the dependence of most academic scientists in North America on external funding. In my dissertation, findings showed that the social organization of biomedical labs in leading universities in Canada has been transformed over the last few decades. Data gathered from more than 70 in-depth work history interviews done in the context of an ethnographic study of biomedical research labs at two leading Canadian research universities in 2002-2003 suggests that there have been changes in the social organization of work (e.g. division of labour, recruitment, structure of organization and occupation) in the biomedical sciences in these universities since the 1960s, and that these changes, including the emergence of larger labs, were due primarily to effects resulting from an increase in competition for federal grants in the 1980s, after institutional accommodation of external funding made biomedical faculty dependent on them. The main argument is that the major influence has been dynamic federal research funding and its institutional accommodation. Specifically, dependence of an academic career on maintaining competitive federal funding led scientists to change their work and organizing practices; applying for multiple grants, and recruiting graduate students and postdocs instead of technicians as in the past, which led to a transformation in both the organization of research and training. Current dependence of biomedical scientists supported by standard federal grants (as most are) on the work of trainees in a competitive funding environment is associated with the incorporation of trainees into the production of faculty research and publication with several institutionalized practices, using a change in the reward system in science. The career strategy necessary, obtaining multiple grants, also means that individual labs of successful biomedical scientists grow in size. As they do, scientists tend to change their practices, such that the social organization of research and post-graduate training in large and small labs typically differs considerably.</description><creator>Salonius, Annalisa.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Biology -- Research -- Canada.</subject><subject>Laboratories -- Sociological aspects.</subject><subject>Biology -- Research -- Economic aspects -- Canada.</subject><subject>Biological laboratories -- Sociological aspects.</subject><title>Working in the lab : social organization of research and training in biomedical research labs in Canada and its relationship to research funding</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ks65hg69w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6q182p719</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Sociology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zc77st60s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Martin Luther's rhetoric of the demonic in his treatise Against the Heavenly Prophets in the Matter of Images and Sacraments (1525) expresses a soteriological argument regarding the necessary relation between the two realms of faith and works, which he reformulates as the proper relationship between justification and sanctification. Ultimately the lack of a such a hermeneutic of the two realms is what Luther sees as decisive in the theological argument of Andreas Bodenstein von Karlstadt and "the heavenly prophets" and the source of what renders them demonic. This demonic confusion between the two realms affects in turn their interpretations of ontology, anthropology and Christology and drives their radical understanding of how the two kingdoms relate. According to Luther, this confusion is grounded in a flawed "demonic" interpretation of the two kingdoms, and results in a disordered political and social agenda owing to its embrace of a reasoning of extremes. The radical reformers' confusion of the "two realms" is the essence of the demonic for Luther and is underpinned by unorthodox presuppositions. For Luther, all the principal theological loci depend upon the dialectical structure implicit in the logic of the two realms. When one appreciates that Luther's dialectical theory cannot be treated in isolation from his practical, homiletical goal as expressed in his rhetoric, it becomes clear that his polemic against the radical reformers is carried out by means of a rhetoric which draws upon his understanding and definition of the demonic. The dissertation builds upon the revisionist approaches of interdisciplinary studies by applying the concerns of rhetoric and linguistics as new tools of research in the field of Reformation Studies. It is hoped that such an approach will enable a more even-handed assessment of the often shocking language and disturbing rhetorical devices employed by a controversial theologian like Luther.</description><creator>Ristau, Harold.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Salvation -- Christianity -- History of doctrines -- 16th century.</subject><subject>Luther, Martin, 1483-1546.

Not yet widely known to an English audience, his work has recently been attracting a growing readership among students of phenomenology as well as among those interested in the so-called 'return of religion' since the last quarter of the 20th century. For those interested in the relation of the phenomenological method to this return of religion, one of the main issues is how phenomenology itself is being (re)defined and expanded to address new modes of phenomenality, including what has been called by Henry and others 'invisible phenomenality'. Building upon a key insight of Husserl as established in his famous "principle of principles", Henry seeks to articulate this 'invisible' phenomenality largely in response to the work of Heidegger---as the core of fundamental ontology. This study carefully considers the unfolding of this 'new phenomenology' in Henry's work in its various dimensions: in its situatedness within the Western philosophical tradition, especially in its relation to Heidegger's critique of onto-theology; in its dialogue with classic philosophies of the subject and its interior life; in its relation to the question of language and the problem of representation; with regards to ethics, the problem of intersubjectivity and contemporary philosophies of 'otherness'; and finally, in terms of its possible contribution to theological thinking today. Throughout a discussion of these dimensions of his work, certain implicit aspects of Henry's thinking will be made more clear by reading them through the work of contemporary phenomenologist Jean-Luc Marion, whose own work is admittedly heavily indebted to Henry, and whose own articulation and extension of Husserl's "principle of principles" plays a crucial role.</description><creator>Rebidoux, Michelle.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Phenomenology.</subject><subject>Henry, Michel, 1922-2002.</subject><title>Given life : the phenomenology of Michel Henry</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zw12z8777.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cr56n4698</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Religious Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vm40xw58z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis analyzes the effect of trade liberalization on horizontal mergers. It consists of two parts. The first part contains two essays, where the merger pattern is exogenously given within a static setting. The second part contains one essay, where the merger process is endogenized within a dynamic setting. The first and second essays analyze the effects of bilateral tariff reductions in a two-country world on the profitability and desirability, respectively, of a given cost-reducing merger within a Cournot oligopoly. Both essays show that for a given level of cost-savings, the impact of marginal trade liberalization may not reliably predict that of non-marginal liberalization. The first essay shows that for any positive tariff below a certain threshold, marginal trade liberalization is shown to encourage only those domestic mergers with sufficiently large cost-savings and to discourage the rest. For tariffs close to, but smaller than, the prohibitive tariff, however, marginal trade liberalization necessarily encourages all domestic mergers. The second essay shows that marginal trade liberalization increases the desirability of merger in the neighborhood of free trade, but has the reverse effect at sufficiently high tariff levels. In the neighborhoods of free trade and the prohibitive tariff, for sufficiently low cost savings from merger, desirability and profitability of merger are shown to move in opposite directions in response to trade liberalization, whereas for intermediate levels of tariff they move in the same direction. Interestingly, in the neighborhood of free trade, for sufficiently low cost savings from merger, trade liberalization increases the desirability of merger whilst decreasing the profitability. Furthermore, regardless of the level of cost savings from merger, this essay identifies ranges of tariff levels for which, if trade liberalization increases (decreases) the desirability of merger it necessarily increases (decreases) its profitability. The third essay uses a dynamic model with an endogenous merger process to examine the effects of trade liberalization on industry structure. A dominant-firm model within a two-country framework is used, where domestic and cross-border mergers and demergers are allowed for. When firms are myopic and the dominant firm has a sufficiently high pre-merger capital share in any one country, trade liberalization causes the industry to become significantly more concentrated. When firms are forward-looking, this anticompetitive effect of trade liberalization is mitigated. At prohibitive tariffs, the dominant firm buys capital in one country and sells in the other. Tariff reduction from a prohibitive to a non-prohibitive level aligns merger patterns across countries and initiates merger (or demerger) waves, provided all firms are equally forward-looking. When the dominant firm is more forward-looking than the fringe, however, this result may be reversed. These results, thus, highlight the importance of taking into consideration existing industry structure and firms' discount rates whilst formulating competition policy in the face of trade liberalization.</description><creator>Ray Chaudhuri, Amrita.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Consolidation and merger of corporations.</subject><subject>Free trade.</subject><title>Mergers under trade liberation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128nj331.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vm40xw58z</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Economics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g445ch83m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study explores the impact of racism on the identity construction of Black Nigerian youth in Montreal. Several themes, related to socialization, family, education, integration, employment, racism, marginalization and social exclusion emerged from phenomenological interviews of 10 Nigerian youth, 5 parents and 3 community leaders. These expressions of their lived experiences exposed the negative impact of racism and racist discourses of the Canadian society on minority groups. It simultaneously showed, through the acquisition of pro-social skills, the extent that marginalized groups, as depicted by Nigerian youth, formulate resiliency and strategies to resist and deconstruct their "othering," in order to construct a healthy identity.</description><creator>Ogbuagu, Buster C.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Group identity.</subject><subject>Nigerians -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><subject>Youth, Black -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><title>In search of communal identity : the role of the Black community in identity formation among Nigerian youth</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6q182p72k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g445ch83m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):16325</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
