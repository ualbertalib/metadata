Introduction may serve as a medium where the author can excuse himself for the failures of its study and may solicit for the indulgence of the reader on the basis that many of them were not unknown to him.

The conductivities along and perpendicular to the layers of carbon atoms in the graphite crystal are recalculated using a more refined value for a certain exchange integral. It is found that the ratio of these two quantities is of the order of 104, in agreement with experiment. The change of the conductivity parallel to the layers due to the presence of a magnetic field is also computed. The agreement with experiment can be considered as satisfactory considering the approximations made in the process of calculation: the calculated values show a more rapid variation with temperature than the experimental ones. Finally a theoretical computation of the Hall coefficient is attempted.</description><creator>Godin, Gabriel.</creator><date>1953</date><subject>Mathematics.</subject><title>A study on some electrical properties of graphite.</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4f16c652v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3x816r56c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nc580r598</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:41:35Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The wall-rocks of the Bridge River gold quartz veins have been hydrothermally altered by warm alkaline mineralizing solutions, containing carbon dioxide, potassium, sulphur and arsenic, which has brought about the partial replacement of the primary constituents of the wall-rocks by such secondary minerals as carbonates, sericite, talc, epidote, chlorite, albite, quartz, pyrite and arsenopyrlte. The dominant process of the alteration has been that of carbonization with up to 75 per cent of the rocks being altered to carbonate.

A phenolic chromogenic substance was found to be responsible for the antibiosis of the extracts. The degradatory products of the anthocyanin pigment from the plant were shown to have somewhat similar toxicities to those of the extracts. The organic acids, citric, malic and oxalic, reported present in appreciable quantities in the plant, were also assayed for antimicrobial properties, and were found to be somewhat more toxic than the phenolic substances. It was not possible to draw a definite relationship between the above antimicrobial properties, and the actual non-susceptibility of the plant to microbial attack.</description><creator>Fernando, Derrick.

Horkheimer and Adorno' s theories of the "dialectic of enlightenment" and  “negative dialectics" provide a self-critical social analysis that interconnects the domination of humanity by humanity and the domination of nature in a way that strengthens the critique of Christian ethics. Further, Horkheimer and Adorno's "longing for the wholly other" resonates profoundly with Christians who believe in a God of Justice.  By the same token, Christian reflection on critical Theory leads to a critique ofHorkheimer and Adorno's excessive distance from political practice and their narrow understanding of radical praxis. In this “new dialogue" the project of Christian ethics develops a more substantial critique of domination, while the Critical Theory of Horkheimer and Adorno is critiqued and renewed.</description><description>Cette thèse examine les différentes manieres avec lesquelles la Théorie Critique et l'éthique de la théologie de la libération chrétienne s'entrecroisent et s'informent mutuellement. Les théories d'Horkheimer et d'Adorno sur la "dialectique de la raison" et "dialectique négative" apportent une analyse altocritique de la société et associent la domination de l'humanité par l'humanité et la domination de la nature de manière à renforcer la critique de l'éthique chrétienne. De plus, le concept du "désir pour le tout Autre" qui ont Horkeimer et Adorno résonne profondément chez les chrétiens qui fondent leurs foi dans un Dieu de Justice. Dans ce sens, la réflection chrétienne sur la Théorie Critique amène une critique d'Horkheimer et Adorno qui veut noter leur distance excessive envers les pratiques poli tiques et leurs mécompréhension du praxis radical. Dans ce "nouveau dialogue ll le projet chrétien de l'éthique, amène une critique plus substantiel de ce qui est la domination et de ce fait renouvelle et illumine la Théorie Critique d'Horkheimer et D'Adorno.</description><creator>Gilbert, Bruce</creator><date>1993</date><subject>Christian sociology.</subject><subject>Liberation theology.</subject><subject>Philosophy of religion.</subject><subject>Christian ethics.</subject><subject>Critical theory.</subject><title>Critical theory and Christian ethics: a new dialogue</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vh53x0837.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nv935705d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Religious Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1j92gc265</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T21:13:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Within recent years the whole concept of illness and treatment has undergone radical revision and emerged with a shift in emphasis and a broadening of its base. It had been accepted practice to concentrate on the diseased organ which was treated as an entity existing independently of the patient. Gradually, however, came the recognition that the emotional and social together with the physical features of illness enter into the disease process and should be considered together in order to restore the individual to full health.</description><creator>Endler, Mildred.</creator><contributor>Kowell, G.

When conditions are such that the atmosphere can no longer hold all the water it contains as water vapour, clouds appear first, and precipitation may or may not fall out of these clouds.
