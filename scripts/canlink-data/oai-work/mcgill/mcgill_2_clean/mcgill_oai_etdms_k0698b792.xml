Some parameters of SRS-A and histamine release from skin fragments were compared with those of lung. By filtration through Biogel P-2 in aqueous medium, it was demonstrated that SRS-A released from lung or skin fragments exists as a molecular size species of about 1000 daltons, some of which is reversibly bound to macromolecular component(s). On the other hand, SRS-A sieved through Sephadex LH-20 ln 80% ethanol had a molecular weight of 350-400 daltons. A comparison was made of the gel filtration properties of SRS-A and several prostaglandins in both gel-solvent systems. The results suggested that 350-400 daltons may closely approximate the actual molecular weight of monkey SRS-A.</description><creator>Kuritzky, Barbara</creator><contributor>Goodfriend, L.
