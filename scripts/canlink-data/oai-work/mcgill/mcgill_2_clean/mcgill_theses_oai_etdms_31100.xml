Two software packages were developed: GREGOR provides flexible and efficient computer algorithms for performing genetic simulation experiments, and KIN provides improved methods for estimating coancestry from known pedigrees. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were investigated in elite barley lines, and estimates of genetic distance based on RAPD markers were compared to estimates based on coancestry. Both types of estimate can provide information that is useful to breeders and geneticists. Genetic simulation was used to investigate the power, accuracy and precision of several methods that are available for analyzing quantitative trait loci (QTL). In most cases, simplified methods of QTL analysis based on linear regression were similar or superior to more complex methods based on mixture models. Methods for genetic analysis using selective genotyping and pooled DNA were also investigated. These methods may allow precise estimates of the positions of markers and QTL to be made.</description><creator>Tinker, Nicholas Andrew</creator><contributor>Mather, D. E.

The gene encodes a putative polypeptide (CnjB) of 1748 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 200 kilodaltons and a pI of 7.9. Four transcription start sites were mapped. The gene has only one genomic copy and is not conserved in yeast (as determined by cross-hybridization experiments with yeast DNA). Analysis of the 13 introns in cnjB, accompanied by 15 other T. thermophila intron sequences, shows that they resemble the nuclear pre-mRNA introns of other eukaryotes. The carboxy-terminal third of CnjB has three regions with repetitive sequences. One region contains seven retroviral-type zinc fingers and the others contain repeated glycine-rich motifs, a motif seen in the heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear proteins A1 and A2/B1. Proteins with these motifs have single-strand binding and strand annealing activity. Synthetic phosphorothioate oligonucleotides antisense to regions of the isoleucyl tRNA synthetase gene transcript did not affect cell growth in a sequence-specific manner when cultures of T. thermophila were grown in their presence.</description><creator>Taylor, Frances Mary</creator><contributor>Martindale, D.

When the polystyrene blocks are kept short, they self-assemble in bulk to form spherical microdomains. Furthermore, the polystyrene segments are highly stretched in the non ionic microdomains, as was also observed previously for the ionic segments of comparable lengths in the ionic microdomains. These findings support the hypothesis that chain extension in microdomains of diblock ionomers in bulk is the result of the high surface energy and not of the ionic character of one of the blocks. The presence of spherical ionic domains in diblock ionomers with short ionic blocks is confirmed by electron micrographs. An increasing size of the ionic microdomains for diblocks with a high polydispersity in the ionic chains relative to that in samples of low polydispersity is seen only in samples prepared close to thermodynamic equilibrium, such as casting from a solvent which is good for both blocks. When diblock ionomers of short ionic block lengths are dissolved in a solvent selectively good for the polystyrene block, micelles are formed which consist of ionic cores surrounded by a corona of polystyrene segments swollen by the solvent. The core size depends only on the ionic block length, and varies as the 3/5 power of the number of units in the ionic block, as predicted by the star model for block copolymer solutions. The ionic cores have a low polydispersity in sizes. The sizes are independent of the chemical structure, of polymer concentration, of polystyrene block length, and of solvent composition provided it is of low polarity. Water can be solubilized into the ionic cores up to a limit. Aggregation number, surface area per chain and micellar mass can be obtained from the SAXS results. The micelles show a high degree of organization in solution, as evidenced by the presence of a structure peak even at 1% polymer concentration; up to three peaks are seen for solutions above 2% polymer concentration. The possible scattering models that could explain the observed structure peaks are discussed.</description><creator>Nguyen, Thi Ngoc Diep</creator><contributor>Eisenberg, Adi (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Chemistry, Polymer.</subject><title>The morphology of diblock ionomers in the solid state and in solution : a study by small angle X-Ray scattering</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z029p619t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jq085m80m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:37720f33t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:23:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis a method based on Green's second identity is developed for computing several orders of derivatives from finite element solutions with $C sp circ$ continuity. The integration by parts implicit in Green's theorem permits numerical integration to replace numerical differentiation. This procedure is initially developed for harmonic functions, then extended to Poisson and Helmholtz equations for a circular region, as well as to harmonic potentials in axi-symmetric coordinates. For the 2-D Laplace operator three other base regions have been introduced: rectangle, sector of circle and sector of ring. The method is numerically stable, position independent and very accurate. Its accuracy is the same as of original finite element solution or even better, when the point of interest is not close to the edge of the region. Treatment of singular integrals is based on using the finite part integration concept. Integration formulas are given. The method is verified with analytical functions, using accurate values and finite element solutions. It is also applied in anisotropic nonlinear magnetic material modeling. Accurate computation of derivatives from finite element solutions is an important step in CAD postprocessing. Direct differentiation of basis functions is inaccurate. Superconvergent methods give satisfactory results in gradient calculation, but their accuracy is position dependent and second or higher derivatives are unreliable. With the new technique it is possible to compute derivatives even where finite element solution itself has insufficient continuity, e.g. finding second order derivatives from $C sp circ$ continuous solutions.</description><creator>Omeragić, Dževat</creator><contributor>Silvester, Peter P.

In juvenile chickens B cells emigrate from the bursa at a rate of about 1% of the peripheral blood and spleen B cell pools per hour. Three distinct B cell populations have been identified in the blood: population 1 is the largest, consisting of short lived cells that express the surface marker LT2 and emigrate directly from the bursal follicular cortex. Population 2, the next largest population, also consists of direct bursal emigrants that are longer lived cells, and lack surface LT2. Population 3 B cells are short lived, and are derived from a bursal-independent and rapidly dividing source, which is, however, ultimately dependant on the bursa for its establishment. Only 5% of the lymphocytes generated daily in the bursa emigrate to establish the peripheral B cell compartment. The remainder die in situ by apoptosis. Cell death in the bursa is preceded by loss of surface immunoglobulin, a threshold level of which appears essential for progression through the cell cycle and subsequent emigration.</description><creator>Paramithiotis, Eustache</creator><contributor>Ratcliffe, Michael J.

These are policies which are of clear public benefit, but which involve high political costs to those who enact them. It is suggested that there are two routes to political tractability in the passage of these policies. The "low-risk" strategy entails insulating policy-makers from pressures applied by alienated vested interests. The "high-risk" strategy arises where actors responsible for passing intractable policies risk alienating vested interests if enacting the policy assists them to realize higher-order objectives. These higher-order objectives involve games of institutional design--attempts to reform or preserve (in the face of threat) the institutional structure of the state. The dissertation examines a subset of politically intractable policies called watershed trade policies. Watersheds are instances of substantial trade liberalization which reverse a long-standing tradition of protectionism. The dissertation explains the passage of three watersheds: Britain's repeal of the Corn Laws, the US Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, and Canada's Free Trade Implementation Act, in the context of the high-risk strategy. In these cases, trade liberalization is explained as a by-product of games of institutional design undertaken by political entrepreneurs within the state.</description><creator>Lusztig, Michael</creator><contributor>Meadwell, Hudson (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>International trade -- Political aspects</subject><title>Trade liberalization and institutional design</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sf2686698.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n870zs332</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1c18dh32f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:23:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The cadherins are a family of calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecules. The regulators of cadherin expression have not been identified. We have examined the ability of hormones to regulate the expression of cadherin subtypes present in the mouse testis, ovary and uterus. 17-$ beta$ estradiol caused a rapid and significant increase in N-cadherin mRNA levels in the Sertoli cells of the testis and granulosa cells of the ovary. This hormone was also capable of stimulating E-cadherin mRNA levels in the epithelial cells of the ovary and uterus. Progesterone was capable of increasing E-cadherin mRNA levels in the uterus but not in the ovary. These studies are the first demonstration that steroids are capable of regulating cadherin mRNA levels in vivo. Furthermore, this is the first demonstration of a physiological role for 17-$ beta$ estradiol in the testis. Follicle stimulating hormone was capable of increasing N-cadherin mRNA levels in mouse testes and in cultured mouse Sertoli cells. The stimulatory effects of FSH on Sertoli cells were mimicked by cholera toxin and forskolin, suggesting the involvement of the cAMP signal transduction pathway. Furthermore, there was a synergistic effect between 17-$ beta$ estradiol and elevated levels of cAMP on N-cad mRNA levels in cultured Sertoli cells. Our observations indicate that steroids and follicle-stimulating hormone are key regulators of cadherin expression.</description><creator>MacCalman, Colin Donald</creator><contributor>Blaschuk, O. W.

A new approach has been developed, and the asymptotic normality of the hazard rate estimator $ lambda sbsp{n}{(2)}(x),$ which has not been established even in complete data cases, is established. By the same method, we derive the asymptotic normality of other hazard estimates, such as $ lambda sbsp{n}{(1)}(x), lambda sbsp{n}{(3)}(x),$ and $ lambda sbsp{n}{(5)}(x),$ as well as the density estimator $ f sb{n}(x).$ The second part of this thesis is devoted to the strong consistency and rates of convergence of the estimates mentioned above; these results improve and extend the previous results in Schafer (1985), Mielniczuk (1986), and Uzunogullari and Wang (1992). Lastly, we consider the consistency of the estimates $ beta sb{n}$ and $ Lambda sb0$ in the general relative risk regression (GRRR) models. We also consider the identifiability of $ beta sb0$ in GRRR models, and prove that most GRRR models possess the same properties as in the Cox regression model, and therefore should be used more often in practice.</description><creator>Lu, Jiang, 1957-</creator><contributor>Derroye, Luc (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Gu, Minggao (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Statistics.</subject><title>Some advances of inferences in mixed censorship-truncation models</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vd66w129s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4t64gp88n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kd17cv54v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:23:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Peripheral nerve injury (conditioning lesions) can cause unknown changes in the nerve cell body that enhance axonal regeneration (Richardson &amp; Issa, 1986; Richardson &amp; Verge, 1987). This thesis further investigated the signals that cause changes in nerve cell bodies which are favourable to axonal regeneration. When inflammatory reaction was induced in the lumbar dorsal root ganglion by injection of Corynebacterium-parvum, axons in the crushed dorsal root were stimulated to regenerate just as by sciatic nerve transection. The numbers of macrophages in lumbar dorsal root ganglion increased 4 days after sciatic nerve transection and this increase lasted at least for a month. mRNAs for the regeneration-associated molecules GAP-43 and C-jun are increased after injection of Corynebacterium-parvum into lumbar dorsal root ganglion as after sciatic nerve transection. These studies indicate that the signals from inflammatory cells can contribute to axonal regeneration and that macrophages are in position to influence cell bodies when their axons are regenerating.</description><creator>Lu, Xin, 1950-</creator><contributor>Richardson, Peter M.

Response in milk and milk component yield was positive and very consistent for multiparous cows between lactations. Average responses in milk production for the first lactation and for the 320-, 640-, and 960-mg$ cdot$28d$ sp{-1}$ doses of bST were 4.3, 5.2 and 5.9 kg$ cdot$d$ sp{-1}$, respectively. Response was 4.9 kg$ cdot$d$ sp{-1}$ for the average of the second lactation with 640 mg bST$ cdot$28d$ sp{-1}$. Primiparous cows responded with the same numerical magnitude as multiparous cows but with higher variability. BST caused a response in milk yield irrespective of the stage of lactation when injections commenced, but the magnitude of response was greater at latter stages of lactation. No adverse effect of treatment on final body condition score and achievement of proper condition for a subsequent lactation was found. No effect of treatment was observed on health parameters in either lactation. Trends towards longer days open and more breedings per conception were apparent for both lactations. Total milk protein, caseins and whey proteins were not changed at any stage of lactation and for the average of the full lactation. BST did not significantly change proportions of $ alpha sb{s}$-, $ beta$- and K-caseins. Milk fat percentage and milk fatty acid profiles were not different between control and any dose level of bST for a complete lactation. Maximum response in milk yield for the different doses of bST was from d8 to 12 of the 28d cycle and was almost eliminated by d22 to 24. A 3.1 and 3.6 kg$ cdot$d$ sp{-1}$ milk augmentation with bST was estimated in cows infused for 6d with glucose and saline, respectively during peak lactation.

A cDNA, S1, was isolated in rat; its predicted amino acid sequence shares high similarity (92.6%) with mouse and human EF-1$ alpha$. The principal objective of this thesis is the molecular characterization of S1, a member of the mammalian EF-1$ alpha$ gene family. We have cloned an EF-1$ alpha$ cDNA in rat, and showed that rat S1 and rat EF-1$ alpha$ are two different mRNAs that share extensive sequence similarity in the coding region, but differ considerably in their noncoding regions. The 3$ sp prime$ noncoding regions of S1 and EF-1$ alpha$ were subcloned into the pGEM3z plasmid and cRNA probes were synthesized using an in vitro transcription method. Northern analysis and RNase protection assays have shown that S1 mRNA can only be detected in rat and mouse brain, heart, and muscle, whereas EF-1$ alpha$ mRNA can be detected in all tissues. These results were confirmed by non-radioactive in situ hybridization. A strong S1-positive signal was detected in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, medulla, and cerebellum of rat brain, whereas liver sections were negative. Certain cells, such as Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum, and motor neurons of the lower brain stem, were S1-positive. On the other hand, EF-1$ alpha$ mRNA was detected in all cell types that we have examined so far. These results prompted us to hypothesize that S1 is a terminal differentiation-specific EF-1$ alpha$ isoform, whose expression is limited to permanently growth-arrested cells. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the expression of S1 and EF-1$ alpha$ during rat development. S1 upregulation correlates with the terminal differentiation process during in vivo neurogenesis and myogenesis. Furthermore, S1 expression is dependent upon the formation of multinucleated myotubes during myogenesis in culture. EF-1$ alpha$ mRNA levels are down-regulated</description><creator>Lee, Stephen, Ph.

Results demonstrate that stimulation trains used in SABS are reinforcing and that animals regulate pulse frequency to optimize the level of reward. The thesis then explored whether pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg) lesions blocked the acquisition or maintenance of SABS, and the acquisition of eight-arm radial maze learning. Results showed that lesions confined to the PPTg block acquisition and maintenance of SABS, suggesting that the PPTg mediates the positive reinforcing effects of BSR. Further, PPTg lesions blocked win-shift and win-stay radial maze learning. However, results indicate that animals were not impaired in "shifting" or "staying" behavior. It is speculated that PPTg lesions block the reinforcing effects of food, which produce inefficient performance on both memory tasks.</description><creator>Lepore, Marino</creator><contributor>Franklin, K.

The investigation was extended to a group of left brain-damaged (LBD) and non brain-damaged (NBD) individuals. Four additional studies investigated and found no age effects in the use of contextual information in pronoun resolution. The results of the experiments with brain-damaged subjects were contrary to initial expectations. All three experiments were consistent in demonstrating that the RBD group was influenced by contextual information in a manner similar to that demonstrated by both the LBD and NBD groups. The results are discussed in terms of the distinction between automatic and effortful processing.</description><creator>Leonard, Carol</creator><contributor>Waters, Gloria (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Health Sciences, Speech Pathology.</subject><subject>Psychology, Psychobiology.</subject><subject>Language, Linguistics.</subject><title>The use of contextual information by right brain-damaged individuals in the resolution of ambiguous pronouns</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mc87pr92w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3t945s392</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Communication Sciences and Disorders</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ft848s114</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:23:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>An in-depth investigation is carried out to characterise the damage accumulation mechanisms and fatigue growth in single wood pulp fibres, which may be thought of as concentrically-layered, filamentary composite tubes that are approximately: 1-3 mm long, 20-40 $ mu$m in cross-section. The novel experimental methodology principally consists of the in situ apparatuses, on the one hand, which comprise the in-house designed and built single-fibre tensiometer, in conjunction with the confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) and, on the other, the computer hardware and periphery. The tensiometer's prime components, the loading jaws, are specifically designed to best emulate the force actions to which wood pulp fibres are subjected while between the discs of mechanical refiners (viz.: cyclic shear, radial compression and tension); and incorporate a mechanical fixation mechanism to ensure proper mounting of the single fibres. Moreover, the CLSM, which functions by scanning a diffraction-limited spot of light relative to the specimen in a raster-type scan, is a powerful tool for obtaining qualitative information on the morphology of fractured surfaces and structural behaviour of the fibres being fatigued, as well as providing accurate visual records of the history of crack propagation. The entire fully-automated set-up is controlled, in real time, via a computer algorithm specifically written for displacement-control fatigue-testing, while making efficient utilisation in terms of execution time, memory allocation, signal conversion and data acquisition. The engendered conclusions may be summed up as follows. From a litany of tenuously-oriented microcracks, dominant macrocracks propagate along the axis of the fibre which may sharply deflect in the presence of natural bias (e.g. pits in the fibre wall). The material property degradation characteristics further include: volumetric expansion due to internal fibrillation in the cell wall, extensive external fibrillation, gradual delamination of the layers and partial peeling-off of the cell wall material. Cumulative damage due to cyclic shear is shown to be the most significant, further supported by the high structural collapsibility of the fibre wall layers. The mechanisms of fracture are either due to the development of transverse cracks at regions of high stress concentration (such as bordered pits), or owing to the gradual slippage of the fibre wall layers.</description><creator>Hamad, Wadwood Y.</creator><contributor>Provan, James W.

Water movement is simulated to, or from, a buried tile drainage system through a heterogeneous and anisotropic soil to a zone of water extraction by plant roots and the atmosphere. The computer package links a newly-developed one-dimensional unsaturated ground water flow model to a three-dimensional saturated water flow model that was modified for the linkage and for simulating water flow under different water table management systems and varying climatic conditions. The movement of water is determined for a region of the field and the model can show the effectiveness of a water table management scheme to meet moisture conditions for crop growth for a wide range of soil, topographical, drain layout and weather conditions. LINKFLOW was validated and verified with measurements on subsurface drainage, controlled drainage and subirrigation systems in a corn field in southwestern Quebec. The model provides a powerful tool for the design and evaluation of water table management systems, and it can assist in developing control strategies for efficient management of water resources. LINKFLOW is unique among soil water models for the following features: (1) it can be used to simulate with varying topography; (2) it determines 3-D flows from drains in a heterogeneous, anisotropic soil; (3) it presents results in tabular format, contour map format, or 3-D surface format; and (4) it contains software routines for automated control in subirrigation. The formation of the conceptual model, numerical relations, methods of solution, validation, field verification and examples are presented.</description><creator>Havard, Peter</creator><contributor>Prasher, S.

A Multiprocessor Controller and an Extensible Modular Multiprocessor System have been built and have been used to solve problems of real-time digital control and real-time digital simulation in the power electronics and power systems areas. The Multiprocessor Controller, built around three fixed-point digital signal processors(DSPs), has been used in real-time parallel processing to control a voltage-source type pulse-width-modulated power converter. In a pole-placement control strategy with a state observer, the converter has been stabilized with its dc link capacitance reduced by a factor of as much as 120, thus making the converter a potentially practical device for High Voltage direct current transmission. The Extensible Modular Multiprocessor System consists of modules which can be easily added in a mesh architecture to provide more computing power. Each module consists of one or two autonomous processing units (PUs) and the supporting control/interface circuits. A prototype of three modules (five floating-point DSPs) has been built and used in parallel processing to simulate a small power system with two turbo-generators operating in real time as a Transient Network Analyzer(TNA). The power system equations are partitioned by using a new method in which the system is modeled as an interconnection of functional blocks. The power system is simulated by an interconnection of DSP modules, with one module simulating one block. The results of elaborate tests demonstrate the correctness of: (a) the new partitioning method, and (b) the design and operation of the Extensible Modular Multiprocessor System. The results further show that the new partitioning method together with the Extensible Modular Multiprocessor System form a promising approach to digitize the Transient Network Analyzer.</description><creator>Guo, Yan</creator><contributor>Lee, H.

The choir and orchestra are divided into two spatially separated groups, with the soloist one percussionist (who plays the tam-tams, at the same time triggering the playback of the pre-synthesized sounds) providing a central link between the two ensembles. This work, which lasts approximately twenty-three minutes, sets a text of the same title by Saint Francis of Assisi. The analytical paper which accompanies the composition examines the text, the relation of the text to the form of the piece, the formal structure and textural organization of the music, the use of spatialization, along with the pitch organization and details regarding the creation and playback of the synthesized sounds. In addition, there is a discussion of the use of the computer as a compositional tool, in particular the utilization of CHAOTICS, compositional software based on nonlinear or "chaotic" functions.</description><creator>Harley, James</creator><contributor>Mather, Bruce (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Rea, John (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Francis, of Assisi, Saint, 1182-1226 -- Musical settings</subject><title>Analysis of Cantico delle Creature</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7h149r18g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dv13zw057</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Music</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1v53jz759</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:23:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis investigates the interaction between slantwise convection and large scale marine cyclogenesis. The major aspects of the work are: (1) to understand the physics of convective-cyclogenetic interaction using a two layer primitive equation model with a parameterization for slantwise convection, (2) to perform numerous sensitivity experiments with a three layer model to test the robustness of the proposed interaction, and (3) to quantify the contribution of convection to marine cyclogenesis using a high resolution model simulation. The major conclusions are: (a) The two and three layer models produce realistic explosive cyclones with a simple parameterization for slantwise convection. (b) The explosive deepening coincides with the formation of the "bent-back" warm front. (c) The frontogenetic calculations and quasi-Lagrangian heat and vorticity budget calculations performed with the two layer model indicate the following sequence of events: Convection leads to rapid warm frontogenesis through "tilting" and the formation of the bent-back warm front. The sudden surge of cold advection in the regions of the bent-back warm front then forces the upper level heights over the cyclone center to fall in a rather dramatic way. Increased upper level vorticity advection interacts with the low-level system leading to explosive cyclogenesis. (d) The sensitivity study performed with the three layer model indicates that the formation of the bent-back warm front and the proposed interaction are quite robust for a range of parameters. However, there are quantitative differences when the low-level cloud mass fraction, surface drag force, the air-sea thermodynamic disequilibrium, vertical shear and static stability are varied. Shallow convection is insignificant in affecting the dynamics of cyclogenesis. (e) The high resolution simulation reveals that the descending branch of the slantwise convection may be responsible for the formation of the dry slot over the cyclone center in the early stages. The stratification in both the warm and the bent-back warm fronts exhibits slantwise neutrality after the explosively deepening period. (f) The PV (Potential Vorticity) inversion technique indicates that convection contributes to marine cyclogenesis. The inverted wind fields show a small scale cyclonic vortex and the presence of cold advection in the bent-back warm frontal region. (g) The PV diagnostics further reveal that the cold advection in the bent-back warm front decreases the surface potential temperature anomaly leading 10 a smaller contribution of surface
potential temperature anomaly to cyclogenesis. This is actually an indirect effect of convection.</description><creator>Balasubramanian, G. (Govindasamy)</creator><contributor>Yau, M. K.

We review range data acquisition, multi-view integration, and solid modeling. We show that knowledge about the data acquisition procedure yields not only the coordinates of the acquired points, but also additional geometrical information. We use that information to draw a geodesic proximity graph with respect to the surface the data points lie on. Such a graph is useful because it provides the connectivity information necessary for subsequent differential-geometric processing, and three-dimensional surface modeling. We say that the graph is a least-commitment boundary representation, because it does not involve the use of higher level or cognitive processes. We specialize the concept to the common case of line-of-sight optical sensors. We give formal definitions of graph validity using assumptions of object opacity and object rigidity, and we demonstrate that Euclidean proximity graphs drawn on the data points are not valid when the data is sparse with respect to surface concavities. We describe a sub-quadratic incremental view integration algorithm that assumes the data is highly-organized. It guarantees graph validity under restrictive conditions. Therefore, we present another non-incremental algorithm with no assumption on the input data organization. It is based on an iterative carving of the graph faces, starting with the convex hull of all points as the initial model. It builds a hierarchy of models, each of which is internal to the previous one. We test the algorithm with real data on an object homeomorphic to a sphere, and incorporate heuristics designed to yield more geometrically pleasing results.</description><creator>Aubry, Stéphane</creator><contributor>Hayward, Vincent (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Three-dimensional model construction from multiple sensor viewpoints</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3x816p11m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4q77fs95t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sf2686701</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:23:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A technique for on-line simultaneous determination of gas and solids holdup, based on a combination of conductivity and pressure difference measurements, was developed and tested in a laboratory flotation column (10 cm in diameter and 447 cm in height). The actual holdup was determined by an isolating technique. It was found that the shape of dispersed particles could significantly affect the conductivity of the dispersion. For flake-shaped particles, this resulted in unacceptable estimates of solids holdup in solid-water systems when the classical models for a spherical dispersed phase (e.g., Maxwell (1892) and Bruggeman (1934)) were used. Fricke's model (1924), which accounts for particle shape, was found suitable. A critical ratio of dispersed to continuous phase conductivity, CCR, was introduced beyond which the dispersion conductivity is insensitive to the dispersed phase conductivity. Two equations to approximate CCR for any given dispersion were proposed. The effect of concentration, size and type of solid particles on gas holdup was investigated. The presence of solids significantly decreased the gas holdup, by up to 40% relative. Possible mechanisms to explain the effect of solid particles were evaluated based on bubble coalescence, slurry density/viscosity changes, radial profiles and wake structure effects. It was experimentally shown that bubble coalescence was not responsible for the gas holdup reduction. It was proposed that the effect of solids on reducing gas holdup is a combination of an increase in the rise velocity of bubbles due to stabilization of the bubble wake and a change in the gas holdup profile from flat to saddle-shaped.</description><creator>Banisi, Samad</creator><contributor>LaPlante, A.

It is less financially stressful to start farming through a lease agreement than by purchasing the assets. The lease period of landlord indifference between these choices is determined for each combination of input variables. Land value and income forecasting models are developed and presented. These models are based on two similar but conceptually different statistical tests. Each test results in different forecasting models which has implications for the use of such models in the future. Consumption-based asset pricing models are tested using agricultural rental income. These models, although appealing both intuitively and theoretically are found wanting in terms of their formulation as the model results are highly sensitive to the data employed.

In addition to a genetic defect in the fifth component of complement (C5) which is characteristic of A/J mice, defect(s) in monocytopoiesis and/or component(s) involved in this process could also lead to a low accumulation of macrophages at the inflammatory site. Defect(s) could exist at the level of (i) the total number of bone marrow (BM) nucleated cells and/or macrophage progenitors, (ii) response of these cells to factor(s), (iii) the production of factor(s), or (iv) cell cycle time of the macrophage progenitors. The objective of this dissertation was to investigate the two former possibilities. The BM cellularity, as measured by the total number of BM nucleated cells and of granulocyte/macrophage-colony forming cells per femur, in mice of the C5-deficient A/J and C5-sufficient A/J.C5 congenic strains during normal steady state (NSS), were examined and both found to be significantly lower (2-fold) in comparison to that obtained from mice of the C57BL/6 strain. The significance of these results was shown using AxB/BxA recombinant inbred (RI) mouse strain system which determined that total BM nucleated cells observed in NSS did not influence the consequence of the macrophage inflammatory response in mice of the A/J and C57BL/6 strains. BM cells were also examined for their responsiveness to Interleukin-3 (IL-3), a multi-CSF, produced in response to injury or infection and which enhances the generation of myeloid cells. The BM cells of A/J mice were shown to be hyporesponsive to IL-3 treatment in vitro, but BM cells harvested from C57BL/6 mice strongly proliferated to the same treatment. The genetic control of the BM cell response to IL-3 was identified to a single gene.

Double immunofluorescence labeling and stathmokinetic techniques have been used to quantitate the population size and mitotic activity of pro-B cells before $ mu$ chain expression, pre-B cells expressing cytoplasmic $ mu$ chains, and B lymphocytes expressing surface IgM. Two conditions associated with prolonged macrophage activation and B cell neoplasia, pristane oil-treatment and malaria infection, have been found to stimulate the proliferation of pro-B cells but to produce increased cell loss at later cell differentiation stages, suggesting that the stimulation of cells undergoing Ig gene rearrangement may predispose to genetic errors leading to cell death or oncogenesis. During a pretumorous period in E$ mu$-myc transgenic mice a marked stimulation of pro-B and pre-B cells is associated with much subsequent cell loss, suggesting that additional mutations are needed to promote B cell survival and the emergence of a tumorigenic clone. Many early precursor B cells express c-kit but their development is not blocked by a neutralizing anti-c-kit antibody in vivo, suggesting that the role of c-kit can be replaced by alternative signalling systems. The introduction of Ig transgenes in scid mutant mice, unable to rearrange endogenous Ig genes, shows that the survival of successive stages in precursor B cell development depends upon the successful progressive expression of the IgM molecule. The work demonstrates that processes influencing both cell proliferation and loss can be critical in regulating the genesis of both normal and potentially neoplastic B cells in the bone marrow.</description><creator>Rico Vargas, Sergio Arturo</creator><contributor>Osmond, Dennis G.

In contrast to the rapid disappearance of CD4 transcripts in chronically infected T-cell lines, CD4 mRNA levels were unaltered following infection of U-937 cells and two other monocytic cell lines (PLB985 and THP-1) with HIV-III$ sb{ rm B}$. However, infected U-937 cells contained reduced levels of immunoprecipitable CD4 that were complexed intra-cytoplasmically with the HIV-1 envelope precursor, gp160. We next compared CD4 and actin biosynthesis in cellular clones that had been derived by limiting dilution of chronically-infected U-937 cells. In spite of a variety of viral phenotypes produced by these clones, including generation of defective particles, cell surface CD4 was absent in each case studied although levels of CD4 mRNA were not affected. In addition, biosynthesis of CD4 was reduced in all cases in which active expression of viral products had occurred. In general, we observed an inverse correlation between high levels of gp160 expression and CD4 biosynthesis. These findings were reproduced using a microsome-containing in vitro co-translation system involving both CD4 mRNA and gp160 mRNA. To rule out the possibility that U-937 monocytes might select HIV-1 variants unable to modulate CD4 gene expression, we passaged infectious virus from a U-937 clonal derivative onto different monocytic and T-lymphocytic cell lines. We found that infection of each of two lymphocytic cell lines, led to cytopathic replication, and reduced levels of CD4 transcripts. In contrast, infection of three monocytic cell lines failed to generate cytopathicity and did not cause CD4 transcript downmodulation. These studies demonstrate that CD4 transcript modulation in chronically-infected cell lines is determined by cell lineage and that CD4 biosynthesis is impaired during generation of gp160.</description><creator>Geleziunas, Romas</creator><contributor>Wainberg, Mark A.

A 10 to 20-fold excess of stalled RNA polymerases was localized by transcriptional run-on analysis to a 164-nucleotide region that contains four binding sites (A, B, C and 1/2) for polyomavirus large T antigen. Inactivation of thermolabile large T antigen using a temperature-sensitive virus eliminated stalling by RNA polymerases in this region. Mutations in large T antigen binding site A, but not sites B or C, also eliminated the block to transcription elongation. These results suggest that polyomavirus large T antigen binds to the DNA template at site A and blocks elongation in vivo by RNA polymerase II. Virus containing mutations in site A that eliminated stalling by RNA polymerases gave rise to small plaques. Stalling of RNA polymerases by large T antigen may therefore be required for the normal growth of polyomavirus.</description><creator>Bertin, John</creator><contributor>Acheson, Nicholas H.
