Various magnetic materials like Iron, Nickel and Magnetite were introduced into the microspheres, at concentrations of 5 to 10% by weight. The resulting microspheres were characterized for their magnetic responsiveness with a continuous flow apparatus which simulated the vascular system. The effect of specific experimental parameters on the rate of magnetic retention were evaluated using factorial and fractional factorial designs. The observed parameters were the flow tube diameter, test fluid flow rate, magnetic field strength and the mass of added microspheres. The effect of magnetic material type and concentration, microsphere size and test fluid viscosity were also observed. The magnetic retention profiles were photographically recorded and characterized. Computer simulations of various characteristics were completed to interpret several underlying phenomenas of the retention process.</description><creator>Duguay, Daniel G.</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacy.</subject><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</subject><title>Magnetically responsive polylactic acid microspheres for targetable drug delivery</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tm70mx57m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/37720g04k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5d86p2439</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:11:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this study a technique--that almost completely eliminates shrinkage microporosity--has been developed which uses small additions of strontium together with risers and chills to produce porosity-free AZ91C (Mg/Al/Zn) magnesium casting alloy castings. With the optimum level of Sr addition (0.01% to 0.02% Sr), shrinkage microporosity was removed from the casting and concentrated in the riser. The castings were already grain-refined by carbon inoculation. The effect of strontium is explained by a further reduction in the grain size of the castings from 250$ mu$m to 120$ mu$m. This effect produces a much denser casting due to increased mass feeding. In addition, a slow grain growth rate, caused by Sr addition, may keep the liquid intergranular-channel radius large during the final stages of solidification, and results in improved intergranular feeding. Another effect of strontium addition may possibly be attributed to a decrease in the surface tension and viscosity of the liquid AZ91C alloy, which in turn increases capillary feeding of the liquid metal.

Eugenics has been seen as a pseudo-scientific explanation for social problems--a response to the perceived imperial and economic decline of Britain in the late nineteenth century--concealing a number of class, racial and other prejudices. But eugenics can also be understood as the product of a certain type of scientific philosophy, derived in part from a Newtonian model of explanation and from scientific discoveries and advances in evolutionary theory, genetics and statistics. This thesis suggests that the credibility of eugenics rested on an interpretation of these scientific findings guided by a concept of scientific explanation which denied the legitimacy of teleological and non-physicalist approaches to the explanation of social life.</description><creator>Tordjman, Gabriel</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Eugenics -- Great Britain</subject><title>The scientific origins of the British Eugenics Movement, 1859-1914</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nz8061999.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dr26z0518</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mw22v765g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:12:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis studies three novels of the Turkish writer Halide Edib (1884-1964) written between 1908 and 1912, and examines this historical period and her life during it. The thesis deals with the 1908 Constitutional Revolution, the '31 March Incident' and the Turkist movement, as reflected in her novels, as well as independently through secondary sources. The examination of Raik'in Annesi (1980) reveals Edib's ideas on 'ideal womanhood,' morality and divorce. Seviyye Talib (1990) includes her views on the Constitutional Revolution, women's modernisation and the '31 March Incident.' The study of Yeni Turan (1912) reveals much about Turkism, or Turanism, and its political opponent in the novel, Ottomanism. From these novels Edib's main ideas are brought out and examined. Among the recurrent themes analysed are her strong admiration for the Angle-Saxon culture, her understanding of Westernisation, her approach to Islam, and her views on women and family.</description><creator>Nișanyan, Rehan</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Adıvar, Halide Edib, 1885-1964.</subject><subject>Turkey -- Politics and government -- 1909-1918</subject><title>Early years of the Young Turk revolution (1908-1912) as reflected in the life and works of Halide Edib</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mg74qp16h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mw22v765g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Islamic Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vt150m16x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:12:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In its short history, Talent Education, also known as the Suzuki Method, has had a profound impact on the teaching of music to the young. However, despite continued guidance from its founder, Shinichi Suzuki, misconceptions about the method persist among both its practitioners and critics. One route to understanding of pedagogical theory is to look at its origins. To that end, this thesis makes a study of history of the method and its founder, drawing on available sources. Further investigation is carried out on the philosophy and teaching techniques. An exploration is then undertaken of the possible antecedents of Suzuki's method taking into account the prevailing ideas and practices of his cultural environment as they relate to the history, philosophy and teaching techniques of Talent Education. Findings indicate that, while Suzuki's method is clearly appropriate to contemporary society, it represents, in many of its aspects, a continuation of several beliefs and practices of traditional Japanese arts.</description><creator>Madsen, Eric</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Music -- Instruction and study</subject><subject>Violin -- Instruction and study</subject><subject>Suzuki, Shinʾichi, 1898-</subject><title>The genesis of Suzuki : an investigation of the roots of talent education</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3j333444b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vt150m16x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Administration and Policy Studies in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z316q362b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:12:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study compares a collection of decontextualized objects in McGill's Redpath Museum with contemporary historical accounts to see what congruencies can be established between them. It focuses on 125 artifacts gathered in the New Hebrides by a Nova Scotian missionary living on Erromanga between 1872 and 1913. These objects have never been studied before. Collected ethnographic objects are usually studied as they are found in the museum or as they might have been in the field--the movement from one place to the other is not considered significant. Critical consideration of the collecting process imparts information about the manufacture and use of objects, offers insights regarding the relation between local and introduced material culture, and reveals the historically contingent, intercultural relations that made collecting possible. It also exposes the foreign, local, cultural, and individual influences at work when certain items were selected, while others were left behind.</description><creator>Lawson, Barbara</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Ethnology -- Vanuatu</subject><subject>Redpath Museum -- Ethnological collections</subject><title>Collected ethnographic objects as cultural representations : Rev.

Academic choices, goals, and performance in relation to family background, ethnic identity, and cultural socialization were ascertained through semi-structure interviews and questionnaires. The sample of thirty-two McGill University students represented a cross section of majors, and were selected into groups based on length of residency in Canada. Data from university records, which showed the evolution of Chinese enrollment and achievement patterns over the last three decades, provided the historical context for the interviews. Major themes regarding family and ethnic identity emerged which suggest that educational ambitions may be socioeconomically motivated, and rooted in an ethnic minority's aspiration for upward mobility. However, the key facilitator of educational success is a strong home background and family system, which was able to promote and enforce a single-minded pursuit of education.</description><creator>Lee, Judy M.

When medical research seemed to confirm the hereditary origin of mental ability, and as studies began to assert that a great deal of social problems were due to 'weakness of mind', men and women from these professions concerned themselves with the prevention of idiocy, primarily by segregation. As social commentators in late-Victorian England became increasingly concerned about the nation's apparent decline in economic and military competitiveness, these professionals and commentators began to stridently campaign for the detention of idiots in permanent colonies. This process continued during the Edwardian period when many professionals slowly gravitated to the eugenic-led campaign for control of the feeble-minded, a campaign which culminated in the Mental Deficiency Act of 1913.</description><creator>Wright, David</creator><date>1990</date><subject>England -- Social policy</subject><subject>Mental retardation -- Social aspects -- England -- History.</subject><title>The study of idiocy : the professional middle class and the evolution of social policy on the mentally retarded in England, 1848 to 1914</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bk128d06d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j9602303k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:th83m164z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:12:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The aims of this project were to: (1) successfully design two models of reconstructive tissue transplants in the primate, one with a purely sensory nerve supply, the other a mixed sensory and motor supply and (2) achieve long enough survival for reinnervation to have occurred, assuming it can take place in the presence of the immunosuppressants. A neurovascular free flap comprised of the entire soft tissue coverage of the second digit and a hand transplant model were successfully designed in the baboon (Papio hamadryas anubis). Seven transplanted neurovascular free flaps and four hand transplants were undertaken. High dose Cyclosporin A was found to be necessary to prevent rejection. Steroids proved to be a necessary part of the immunosuppressive regime. Nine out of 11 transplants survived to or beyond 4 months. In most cases, the end point was determined by the date for evaluation of reinnervation by our neurophysiologist colleagues and not loss of the transplant due to rejection. Only 3 out of 11 transplants survived with little or no signs of rejection. All others had significant episodes of rejection, most of which were successfully reversed or controlled by using our rejection protocol. In addition, all animals, to varying degrees, demonstrated some of the following side effects: anorexia, anemia, gingival hyperplasia, hepatotoxicity, hirsutism, lymphoma, nephrotoxicity, subcutaneous or intramuscular abscesses and tremors.

Review of the school effectiveness literature indicated eight characteristics of school effectiveness: leadership, expectations, mission, time on task, monitoring, basic skills, climate, and parent/community participation. In addition, research on school effectiveness has found certain procedures or activities that contribute to effective schooling, termed indicators for this study. Of the eight characteristics, creating a positive learning climate was ranked highest, as was the case in a recent study of private schools in the United States. At the level of indicators, top rankings were given to student-oriented concerns: (1) care about students as people, (2) providing an enriched and all-round quality programme for students, (3) pride in the school's and students' successes, (4) listening to students, (5) providing an enjoyable environment, (6) care of students in a professional manner.

Its recovery was comparable with that of amalgamation and the Mozley Laboratory Separator (MLS). It was then used for a study on gold grinding and classification behavior. Laboratory studies of monosized gold and silica showed that gold produces fewer fines upon grinding: 75% of the mass reports to the next Tyler class, as opposed to 45% for silica. Disappearance from the monosized class (840-1200 $ mu$m) follows first order kinetics for both minerals. However, the rate constant of gold was five to six times lower than that of silica, and folding predominated over actual breakage. Folding yields either spherical or cylindrical particles which flatten upon additional impacting. Smearing of gold onto silica and embedding of silica into gold flakes were observed. It was postulated that gold smearing can lead to metallurgical losses in flotation circuits. A gravity circuit could then increase overall gold recovery. The Knelson concentrator was used to study the behavior of gold in the Hemlo mill grinding circuit. The ratio of the selection function of ore to gold increased from 6 at 50-100 $ mu$m to 20 at 500-1000 $ mu$m. In the primary cyclones, gold's cut size was much finer than the ore, 20 vs. 57 $ mu$m.</description><creator>Banisi, Samad</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</subject><subject>Engineering, Mining.</subject><title>An investigation of the behaviour of gold in grinding circuits</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5999n5407.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7h149r728</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rb68xd832</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:12:08Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is a study of the difficulties arising from the application of section 1 of the English Bills of Lading Act, 1855. This study is conducted in the context of the evolution of the law, relevant judgments, international conventions as well as academic views. By the custom of merchants a bill of lading is transferable by indorsement the property in the goods may thereby pass to the indorsee; nevertheless all rights in respect of the contract of carriage evidence by the bill of lading continue in the original shipper or owner. In order to solve this problem, the Bills of Lading Act was enacted in 1855. Unfortunately, its purpose does not appear to have been fully achieved. This study suggests that the Bills of Lading Act should be amended so as to confer the rights of action in the contract for carriage of goods by sea to the buyer or to the owner of the goods shipped under such contract.

Since R. W. Southern published his biography of Anselm, his views have been widely accepted. In his view, Anselm was a devout monk who spent his life contemplating, with clear insight, profound theological issues. Forced to accept the Archbishopric of Canterbury, Anselm was never content with his responsibilities and longed to return to the simple life of a monk. The result was that Anselm blundered his way through conflicts with the Kings of England, William Rufus and Henry I. Because of his inability to handle himself in political spheres, Anselm was forced into exile twice. Within the last decade, however, Sally N. Vaughn has challenged Southern's prevailing views with a re-examination of the sources. In her opinion, Anselm was an astute politician who determined, early on, that he was destined to be Archbishop of Canterbury. Vaughn tries to show that Anselm carefully orchestrated events so that he was in fact elected to the position. Sally Vaughn's Anselm is very different from the contemplative monk of Southern's book. The controversy now centres on whether or not a devout contemplative monk could also be an astute politician while still maintaining an other-wordly detachment. This is the view of Eadmer, Anselm's companion and first biographer. Southern and Vaughn's views, while defensible from the sources, both fail to recognise, unlike Eadmer, the compatibility of vocations as an archbishop and a monk. This thesis will re-examine the sources--Eadmer's biographies and Anselm's writings--to show that Eadmer's view is the correct one. Anselm clearly transferred his intellectual powers into his monastic vocation and from there used his principles as a guiding force of his episcopacy.</description><creator>Macdonald, Stuart.</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Bishops -- England -- Biography</subject><subject>Anselm, Saint, Archbishop of Canterbury, 1033-1109.</subject><subject>Monks -- England -- Biography</subject><title>Aosta, Bec and Canterbury : reconsidering the vocations of St. Anselm (1033-1109) as scholar, monk and bishop</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6969z309m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5999n541h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0z709001g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:12:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this study was to find out if the performance appraisal system (the PMP) of non-academic nonunionized personal of a Quebec university was developed, implemented, administered and maintained adequately. The literature emphasizes certain elements essential to the successful or adequate development, implementation and administration of a performance appraisal system, and it is in reference to this body of literature that the PMP was examined. To find out how the PMP was developed, implemented and administered in practical terms, the researcher interviewed four Human Resources staff members directly responsible for these processes. The findings of this descriptive study showed that in order for a performance appraisal system to be successful, an organization must be thorough in addressing certain essential elements within each step of its development implementation and administration.

This has led to the isolating from one another of the functions of understanding and evaluation, and to the belief that understanding is necessary to science, whereas appreciation is the aim of art. The arts, consequently, are either considered unteachable, or have focused on methods for teaching feeling and appreciation. This thesis proposes an alternative philosophical approach, one which recognizes that the distinction between mediate and immediate experience may be illusory, that the emotions, rather than being dialectically opposed to cognition may be instruments of it, and that appreciation may be as secondary to understanding in the arts as in the sciences. It proposes that the above approach, forwarded by American philosopher Nelson Goodman, offers a new and fresh epistemological framework upon which positive advances in the education of the arts will flourish.

A third trial investigated the relationship of plasma glucose, triglyceride and phospholipid concentrations with degree of fatness/leanness in genetically lean and fat broiler chickens. A combination of supplemental fat and Virginiamycin increased protein and decreased fat content of the dressed carcass. Virginiamycin supplementation overcame the growth depression of a low lysine diet by increasing feed intake. In the low lysine diet, Virginiamycin supplementation reduced abdominal fat deposition in females and increased carcass yield in males. Carcass protein content was increased by feeding the NRC-recommended level of lysine or by Virginiamycin supplementation. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)</description><creator>MacLean, Janice L.

Fictional narrative is discussed in terms of structuralist theory using studies by Mieke Bal, Seymour Chatman and Gerald Prince. Historical narrative is analyzed through the writings of the philosophers of history, Hayden White, Louis O. Mink and Paul Ricoeur. These theories are applied to the fiction of Salman Rushdie in order to investigate his use of narrative. It is concluded that he uses a combination of historical and fictional narrative in order to explode existing 'truths' and mythologies, and to suggest alternative realities in their place.</description><creator>DeAngelis, Angelica Maria</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Rushdie, Salman -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><title>History and fiction as narrative in the novels of Salman Rushdie</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ks65hf30g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f7623f710</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3x816p59s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:12:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This paper examines the relationship of architecture to music in terms of rhythm, harmony and order in both the Greek Antiquity and the early Middle Ages. These basic concepts are crucial because they emphasize 'fullness' of experience and demonstrate the extent to which our own regulating experience of the world has become empirical (or formal).

Altered rocks at the New Insco mine are calc-alkaline andesites (SiO$ sb2 / sim$ 60 wt%, Zr/Y = 6.5, La$ sb{ rm N}$/Yb$ sb{ rm N}$ = 5.3). A tholeiitic rhyolite (SiO$ sb2 / sim$ 77 wt%, Zr/Y = 3.4, La$ sb{ rm N}$/Yb$ sb{ rm N}$ = 2) is located 0.5 km south of the orebody. Net mass change of +11% resulted from additions of Fe$ sb2$O$ sb3$ (16%) and MgO (3%), and losses of Na$ sb2$O (3%) and CaO (3%). Three major alteration assemblages with up to 80% chlorite, 57% sericite and 50% quartz are identified. Mineral and cation plots outline chloritization, sericitization and silicification trends. The Key Tuffite is at the contact of Watson Lake tholeiitic rhyolite and Wabassee mixed calc-alkaline and tholeiitic andesites. Pyroclastic components of the Tuffite are from both rock groups: a tholeiitic rhyolite component--Zr/Y = 2.8 and La$ sb{ rm N}$/Yb$ sb{ rm N}$ = 2.1, and a calc-alkaline andesitic component--Zr/Y = 8.9, La$ sb{ rm N}$/Yb$ sb{ rm N}$ = 6.4. During formation Fe$ sb2$O$ sb3$ (27%, total iron), SiO$ sb2$ (14%), CaO (8%), S and K$ sb2$O were added to the pyroclastic components. The Key Tuffite is composed of 33% quartz, 28% sulfide, 16% sericite, 8% carbonate, 6% chlorite and 9% others. Geochemical and mineralogical trends in altered rocks and tuffites increase toward orebodies and can be used as mineral exploration guides.</description><creator>Liaghat, Sassan</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Geology.</subject><title>Use of immobile elements to determine mass changes and origin of hydrothermally altered rocks : Key Tuffite, Matagami, and New Insco mine, Noranda</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hh63sz035.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bd77h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geological Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8g84mp43n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:12:14Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The aim of this thesis is to show that Laclos' novel, Les Liaisons dangereuses, is not as some critics have claimed a handbook of sexual licentiousness and a bible of debauchery. It is rather a complex and subtle description of the condition of women in 18th-Century France. While the structural importance of the male characters is by no means ignored, it is the female characters who have been the object of our particular study. We have isolated and identified the various social and symbolic representations of women to be found in Laclos' novel: the rebel, the victim, the prostitute, the mother, the young girl and the dowager. In doing so, we have come to see this work as an essentially feminist novel in which women occupy a dominant position. Furthermore, we have shown that Laclos' three essays, Des Femmes et de leur education, are not only a natural and a logical continuation of the novel but also its theoretical counterpart. Finally, in relation to the condition of women and their education, the three essays and the novel allow us to confirm that Laclos does not only criticize the society he lives in but also anticipates the changes that will occur during the Revolution and later.</description><creator>Saddik, Martine</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Laclos, Choderlos de, 1741-1803.

The validity of this work as it applies to architecture, is that through the creation of a mythical order which was grounded in Le Corbusier's perceptions of the modern condition, an understanding of mans' place in the modern world may be found. Through this making of order, Le Corbusier was able to create a geometric 'language' in both the physical and meta-physical sense, i.e. the making of form was based on his 'found' measure of the world. This language of a present day order was developed in his writing and painting and, ultimately, provided the fundamental principles for the creation his work built.</description><creator>Splawn, James M.

The influence of 48 mothers' and 42 fathers' self-esteem and anxiety on the child's achievement, aptitude, self-esteem, and anxiety is also assessed. Main and interaction effects of achievement and aptitude on anxiety are obtained. High achievers have lower anxiety scores than low achievers. Gifted children have higher physiological anxiety than nongifted children. In most cases, gifted low achievers have the highest anxiety scores and gifted high achievers have the lowest. Aptitude and achievement groups do not differ in self-esteem. Mothers of gifted children report higher total self-esteem than mothers of nongifted children. Fathers of high achievers report higher total self-esteem than fathers of low achievers. Parents do not differ in anxiety.

An attempt will also be made to explain why his determination to struggle for the liberation of Cuba acquired continental dimensions, when he became the spokesman for what he called "the greater fatherland", after having anxiously observed the danger hovering over Latin America due to the growth of United States imperialism that threatened neighbouring countries. The thesis will utilize Jose Martis chronicles and articles which will be used for illustrative purposes. These will not imply any prejudice or bias. In order to understand Jose Martis attitude towards the United States, it will be necessary to study Martis concept of "Our America". For this purpose, the essential ideas in Martis messages will be analysed, establishing a parallel between Martis action and his thought.</description><creator>Rodríguez P., Isabel.
