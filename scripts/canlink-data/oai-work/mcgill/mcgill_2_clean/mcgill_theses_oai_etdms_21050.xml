Sharp fractions were used covering the molecular weight range from 3100 to 11600. The crystals were characterized by studying (1) the equlibrium melting/dissolution temperature as a function of the molecular weight, (2) the lamellar thickness as a function of the crystallization temperature and (3) the fusion/dissolution behavior as a function of crystallization temperature. The most interesting results are as follows: (a) The lamellar thickness varies continuously with crystallization temperature. This behavior has been interpreted to provide information on the important question of the location of the chain ends in the crystals. (b) For the higher molecular weight fractions the growth rate decreases monotonically with the crystallization temperature. In contrast for fractions in the molecular weight range of 3000 to 4000 the growth rate versus crystallization temperature curves show a notched appearance in which two branches can be distinguished. These branches intersect at a transition temperature where the temperature coefficient of the growth rates changes discontinuously. This behavior is interpreted to mean that the transition temperatures correspond to changes in the conformation of the molecules deposited on the growth faces. The growth rate data have been analyzed using current kinetic theories of polymer crystal growth. Basal surface free energies thus obtained are compared with the estimates from the relations between lamellar thickness and supercooling and melting/dissolution temperature and lamellar thickness. These results are discussed in relation to the molecular structure of the crystals.</description><creator>Leung, Wing-Man.</creator><date>1982</date><subject>Polyethylene.</subject><subject>Crystal growth</subject><title>Isothermal growth of low molecular weight polyethylene single crystals from solution</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mg74qm76j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6m311q07b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2227mq57z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:47:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Une partie de la region de Paspebiac a ete recouverte par deux glaces contemporaines, lors du dernier stade glaciaire du Wisconsinien.

A dynamic model was developed for bubble nucleation in HPB for predicting the waiting time of a bubble for given boiling conditions. The variation of the surface temperature was incorporated through an additional model proposed for the same. Its application to equilibrium pool boiling of pure components and binary mixtures predicted waiting times in agreement with the experimental values obtained here. A dynamic single bubble departure model considering all the forces acting on a bubble was developed to predict the departure diameter and the wall superheat required for continuously forming bubbles (CFB). The model was developed for 3 temperature distributions (TD) in the thermal layer. It was also applied to binary mixtures and the predictions were found to be in agreement with previously available data. For Ja(,m) (LESSTHEQ) 15, bubble departure is controlled by the surface tension and buoyancy forces while for Ja(,m) &gt; 15, liquid inertia also becomes important. The static single bubble nucleation and departure models of Howell and Siegel were extended. The equations were developed for 3 TD in the thermal layer. The former predicted the wall superheat required for nucleating a bubble on the site, while the latter predicted the departure diameter and the wall superheat for the CFB.</description><creator>Kant, K.

Children between 6 and 11 years were tested. Study 1 examined the development of 3 role-taking tasks. Study 2 compared role taking to nonsocial word-pair comparison to determine whether the self's involvement demanded additional skills. Using original tasks, Studies 3 and 4 related role taking and comparison to referential communication. Study 4 also examined (a) the effects on these behaviours of a direct attentional decentration manipulation and (b) their relation to integration as measured by a modified Gergen-Morse Perceived Self-Consistency Scale. Major results indicated that: most children developed role taking around age 6 and mastered it by 11; nonsocial decentration (comparison) was related to role taking, with comparison developing first; and integration related to role taking but not to comparison. Finally, comparison and role taking were necessary but insufficient for referential communication; integration was also related to communication. The implications of these findings for a theory of role taking were discussed.</description><creator>Skerry, Shelagh Anne.</creator><date>1982</date><subject>Communication.</subject><subject>Child psychology</subject><subject>Role playing.</subject><title>Cognitive and socio-cognitive processes underlying the development of role taking and referential communication</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cv43nx810.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d791sh07z</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pn89d7288</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:47:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A new vapor-liquid equilibrium apparatus was constructed to measure temperature, pressure, and phase compositions up to 8 MPa. Systems of CO(,2) with 2-methyl-1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene and m-xylene were studied at 303.15 K, 323.15 K, and 343.15 K. A general method was proposed for equation of state construction. Two equations of State were constructed. Using critical temperature, critical pressure, critical compressibility factor and acentric factor, these equations can predict saturation properties of normal fluids. The equations were extended to mixtures using van der Waals' one fluid theory, Lee-Kesler corresponding state approach and a virial-like approach. They had limited predictive abilities compared to cubic equations. A correlation for third virial coefficients of nonpolar gases was developed. The correlation requires the knowledge of critical temperature, critical pressure and acentric factor and is applicable to mixtures of nonpolar gases including quantum gases. Predictions are in good agreement with reported experimental data.</description><creator>Orbey, Hasan.</creator><date>1983</date><subject>Hydrocarbons.</subject><subject>Carbon dioxide.</subject><subject>Vapor-liquid equilibrium.</subject><title>Vapor-liquid equilibria of carbon dioxide-hydrocarbon systems at moderately high pressure</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wp988k72f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pn89d7288</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n009w303t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:47:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis investigated the use of song repertoires during territorial defense of the song sparrow, Melospiza melodia. The functional and adaptive significances of repertoires in the order Passeriformes were reviewed. Within the family Fringillidae, an examination of repertoire size and life history features of different species revealed no significant correlations. Observations of six neighboring song sparrows yielded information about the relative uses of repertoire-dependent and repertoire-independent mechanisms in coordinated song interactions, as well as in signalling agonistic probabilities. The behavior of song switching, independent of the identities of song types, was found to most effectively perform both types of functions. A series of playback experiments tested and supported the hypothesis that the song sparrow's rate of switching song types increases with agonistic stimulation. Song versatility, rather than switching rate per se, was found to be an appropriate agonistic stimulus.</description><creator>Kramer, Howard Gary.</creator><date>1982</date><subject>Song sparrow -- Behavior.</subject><subject>Birdsongs.</subject><subject>Territoriality (Zoology)</subject><subject>Birds -- Behavior.</subject><title>The song patterning of song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, in relation to territorial defense /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6w924c55r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n009w303t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n870zr49r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:47:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The interaction of a high power laser beam with the lattice of transparent optical materials induces internal strains in the latter. Attention is focused on optical materials of zinc blende structure and excitation at the 10.6-(mu)m wavelength of the laser. A lattice dynamical treatment is presented to obtain the laser induced internal strains in terms of the lattice Green's functions, the transverse effective charge and the Raman coefficient. The transverse effective charge and the Raman coefficient are then thoroughly discussed and discrepancies in previous works concerning these parameters are resolved. The imperfect lattice Green's functions are utilized to calculate the expected magnitude of the actual strains induced in real crystals taking into account the effect of lattice point defects. The mechanical laser damage thresholds at the 10.6-(mu)m CO(,2) laser wavelength are then obtained specifically for SiC, GaAs, InSb, ZnS, ZnSe, and CdTe materials, in good agreement with the available measured values.</description><creator>Varshney, Subhash Chandra.</creator><date>1983</date><subject>Optical materials.</subject><subject>Laser beams.</subject><subject>Lattice dynamics.</subject><title>Laser induced lattice strains, damage thresholds and related properties</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rf32w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n870zr49r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ks65hc97f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:47:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><creator>Amer, Mohamed A.</creator><date>1972</date><subject>Swine -- Feeding and feeds</subject><title>Effect of supplemental copper and vitamin E on the chemical and physical characteristics of swine depot lipids.</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m039k5781.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hc97f</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Animal Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mg74qm79c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:47:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><creator>Araujo, Hyma Rita B.</creator><date>1971</date><subject>Poultry -- Diseases</subject><title>Studies on immunosuppression in the chicken and its effects on Eimeria tenella infection.</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nv935379c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mg74qm79c</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Parasitology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6h440t18m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:47:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><creator>Basnayake, Basnayakarallage Karunaratna</creator><date>1972</date><subject>Barbados -- Climate</subject><subject>Solar radiation</subject><title>Topography and solar radiation in Barbados.</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x059c835b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6h440t18m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ff365585p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:47:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><creator>Barge, B.

The changes of these substances after hemoperfusion were also studied. A generalized elevation of amino acid concentrations is demonstrated in the systemic blood plasma, portal plasma, CSF, cerebrum, liver, kidney and skeletal muscle tissues in GalN-FHF. The skeletal muscle is found to constitute the greatest source of accumulated amino acids in FHF. The other tissues also contribute to the increased amino acids in the body as a whole. The increase in aromatic amino acids (AAA) tyrosine, phenylalanine and free and total tryptophan were the most striking among all the amino acids, including branched chain amino acids (BCAA), in all the tissues studied. The molar ratio of BCAA/AAA was found significantly reduced in all the tissues studied. $ gamma$-amino butyric acid was found significantly increased in the cerebrum and the brain stem. Most of the increased tryptophan in plasma, and almost 100% of the increased tryptophan in the brain were in the free form (non-protein bound). The increase in tyrosine concentration in plasma was closely correlated with tyrosine in the brain. Hemoperfusion using collodion coated activated charcoal (CAC) significantly reduced a number of aromatic amino acids in the plasma. This was followed by a significant reduction of the AAA in CSF, but not in the brain, of GalN-FHF rats. Hemoperfusion using tyrosinase immobilized within artificial cells selectively reduced tyrosine in the plasma but did not influence the tyrosine level in the brain. Hemoperfusion procedures resulted in a high plasma clearance for the aromatic amino acids. The results also suggested the loss of the blood brain barrier for amino acids across the capillaries. However, transport mechanisms between brain cells themselves and interstitial fluid seems to be maintained. The buildup of middle molecular metabolites (MW 500-2,000) was demonstrated as the elevation of middle molecule peak 7g in the plasma and brain extract samples from GalN-FHF rats using serial liquid chromatography. CAC hemoperfusion significantly reduced the levels of 7g fraction in both plasma and brain extract samples. The fraction of subpeak 7g was found to contain peptidic substances. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis further revealed the peptide nature of some of the middle molecule substances. The estimated molecular weight of these peptides was in the range of 1,300 and 1,400.

Sediment distribution was best characterized by the deposition boundary depth (DBD), the abrupt transition from coarse- to fine-grained sediments. The DBD can now be predicted from either empirical models or empirical-theoretical simplifications of wave of sediment threshold theory, both in terms of exposure (or fetch) and bottom slope. The texture (organic content, water content and bulk density) of profundal sediments was related to the inorganic sedimentation rate and exposure, but not to the lake trophic status or the net organic matter sedimentation rate. The relationships between sediment texture and intra- and inter-site variability, together with the models that predict the DBD and sediment texture, were used to develop an algorithm that should greatly reduce sampling effort in lake sediment surveys. Finally, sediment trace element concentrations were predicted from sediment texture, site depth and simple geologic classifications. The models developed here, provide a framework in which to sample lake sediments and interpret their properties.</description><creator>Rowan, David J.</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Lake sediments.</subject><subject>Trace elements.</subject><subject>Lake sediments -- Sampling.</subject><title>The distribution, texture and trace element concentrations of lake sediments /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t148fh87m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0p096783v</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:12579t048</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:47:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Surrealism is examined through its history and phenomenology. The frame of reference is shifted from the history of art to the history of religions; the premises of modern art historiography examined; and Surrealism placed within an interdisciplinary context. The conjunction between the Surreal and the sacred is developed through the phenomenological clues of the uncanny, the weird, and the irrational--popular perceptions of the Surreal. The Surreal is seen as the transition between the ordinary and the extra-ordinary: as the threshold of the sacred. The origins of the Surrealist impulse to "transform life" are traced to occultism, alchemy, and hermetic philosophy, that attempt to create "the union of opposites". Historically, Surrealism stems from this heterodox tradition of archaic, occult, and daemonic elements in European cultures, yet it radically opposes them to the accepted religion and conventional mentality. In so doing, Surrealism creates a new orientation based upon the power of contradiction and ambivalence.</description><creator>Rabinovitch, Celia.</creator><date>1984</date><subject>Art, Modern -- 20th century -- Themes, motives.</subject><subject>Art and religion.</subject><title>The surreal and the sacred : archaic, occult, and daemonic elements in modern art, 1914-1940</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3197xm60w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/12579t048</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Religious Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fq977v68t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:47:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A solid-state DE-E telescope beta spectrometer has been built and used to study beta-minus spectra.

A Fortran code was developed and validated. The following cases involving complex flow domains were examined in detail; (1) The flow and heat transfer characteristics of Newtonian and power-law fluids in a two-dimensional duct fitted with transverse fins of triangular, semi-circular, and rectangular sections. The calculated velocity distribution is compared with experimental measurements made with a laser-Doppler anemometer. (2) The flow and heat transfer in a two-dimensional 90$ sp circ$ bend formed between two corrugated walls with variable corrugation angles. The results are compared with those obtained for a plain bend and a straight corrugated duct. (3) The flow and heat transfer under a submerged, confined slot jet impinging on planar, wavy, and semi-circular target surfaces. The containment surface was either perpendicular to the jet axis or inclined at a different angle to it. The Nusselt number and friction factor dependence on the appropriately defined Reynolds number and domain geometry was examined; a number of correlations based on extensive numerical experiments are proposed for design calculations. The physical domains chosen in this study have potential applications in heat transfer augmentation and novel compact heat exchanger designs.</description><creator>Nassef, Roger A.</creator><contributor>Mujumdar, A.

Metalinguistic performance was operationalized in terms of two constructs, metalinguistic knowledge about lexical and pronoun reference, and metalinguistic skill in subjects' manipulation of lexical and pronoun reference tokens. Unassisted performance was operationalized in terms of effective spontaneous use of lexical and pronoun reference rather than global performance. Four metalinguistic and four unassisted tasks were included in the design. Twenty four students were tested, six males and six females from each of two Grade levels (Grades 2 and 4). The relationships between metalinguistic and performance variables, and Grade and Gender were tested using multivariate statistical techniques. The results indicated a relationship between metalinguistic and unassisted performance which was highly constrained by task and which was independent of Grade level. Grade effects were only identified for metalinguistic performance and did not coincide with the pattern of the metalinguistic/unassisted relationship. The findings are discussed in terms of the methodological implications for research into metalinguistics and metacognitive knowledge and skill and possible instructional approaches.</description><creator>McAnaney, Donal F.</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Metacognition</subject><subject>Metalanguage</subject><title>The role of metalinguistic knowledge and skill in comprehending, producing, and revising lexical and pronoun reference /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1c18dg52q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4b29b691p</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nk322f09x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:47:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) raised against human transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary bladder, as well as MoAbs binding to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), major histocompatibility antigens and M344 (TCC-specific antigen), were used to study cellular heterogeneity in normal and neoplastic urothelium. Heterogeneity of antigen expression was related to differentiation, proliferative potential, tumor progression and clinical outcome. MoAb 5.48 binds preferentially to superficial cells of normal and neoplastic urothelium. The antigen contains terminal sialic acid, and is present on several glycoproteins. Antigen 5.48 expression is lost with increasing grade and stage, whereas expression suggests a good prognosis. In one TCC, antigen 5.48 expression was associated with loss of proliferative potential. Beta-2-microglobulin binds to the differentiated cells of normal and neoplastic urothelial tissues, but it was not associated with grade, stage or clinical outcome. CEA expression was associated with malignancy and a poor prognosis.

In the concept of correlated random patterns, reductions in a circuit's random pattern test length are achieved by taking advantage of correlations measured between values applied at different input positions in a complete deterministic test set. Instead of being generated independently, correlated inputs have their random values generated from a common source with each input's value then individually biased at a rate necessary to match the measured correlation. In the concept of cube-contained random patterns, reductions in random pattern test lengths are achieved by the successive assignment of temporarily fixed values to selected inputs during the random pattern generation process. The concepts of correlated and cube-contained random patterns can be viewed as methods to compress a deterministic test set into a small amount of information which is then used to control the generation of a superset of the deterministic test set. The goal is to make this superset as small as possible while maintaining its containment of the original test set. The two concepts are meant to be used in either a Built-In Self-Test (BIST) environment or with an external tester when the storage requirements of a deterministic test are too large. Experimental results show that both correlated and cube-contained random patterns can achieve 100% fault coverage of synthesized circuits using orders or magnitude less patterns than when equiprobable random patterns are used.</description><creator>Pateras, Stephen</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Correlated and cube-contained random patterns : test set compression techniques</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wm117p71p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8623hz558</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kk91fm31s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:47:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Iterative-deepening-A* (IDA*) is an admissible heuristic search algorithm which is optimal with respect to space complexity and the cost of solution found over the class of admissible best-first tree search algorithms. However, the optimality of IDA* with respect to time complexity is subject to a number of conditions. It is the focus of this dissertation to identify the conditions that give rise to the worst case performance of IDA* and to delineate a time complexity spectrum between its optimal and worst case performance. In addition, the expected case performance of IDA* is derived with respect to a probabilistic model of computation that assumes the differential edge costs are independently and identically distributed as random non-negative integers. Under this assumption, IDA* exhibits asymptotic optimal performance for any integer probability distribution that satisfies a couple of weak conditions. Finally, to redress the worst case phenomenon of expanding only a few additional nodes over several iterations, a new admissible search algorithm, called Binary IDA* (BIDA*), is presented and compared against the performance of IDA* on the Euclidean traveling salesperson problem. It is shown in a small empirical study that BIDA* is a significant improvement over IDA* as both the tour size and the precision of the edge costs increase.</description><creator>Patrick, Brian Glen</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>An analysis of iterative-deepening-A* /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x059c836m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kk91fm31s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4q77fs10h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:47:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>According to Feature Integration Theory (Treisman &amp; Gelade, 1980), search for a target defined by features on two different dimensions (e.g. green horizontal target among red horizontal and green vertical distractors) is conducted via serial attentive search of all items in the array. Results presented in this thesis clearly demonstrate that conjunction search is not conducted as a serial self-terminating search, and suggest that subjects selectively search a single feature set. Strong support is also provided for the role of local grouping processes in visual conjunction search. This includes evidence demonstrating: (1) that local context is an important factor in directing search toward the target, and (2) that groups of spatially adjacent homogeneous elements can be processed in parallel. These results point to the importance of spatial layout of target and distractor elements. More recent theories (e.g. Cave &amp; Wolfe, 1990) will have to be amended in order to account for these data.</description><creator>Poisson, Marie E.</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Space perception.</subject><subject>Pattern perception.</subject><subject>Visual perception.</subject><title>Studies in visual search : effects of distractor ratio and local grouping processes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sn009z683.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4q77fs10h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:w6634451b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:47:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Due to the nature of survey design, the estimation of parameters associated with small areas is extremely problematic. In this study, techniques for the estimation of small area proportions are proposed and implemented.

The proposed techniques are applied to data from the 1950 United States Census to predict local labor force participation rates of females. Results are compared with those obtained using unbiased and synthetic estimation approaches. Using the proposed methodologies, a sensitivity analysis concerning the prior distribution assumption, conducted with a view toward outlier detection, is performed.
