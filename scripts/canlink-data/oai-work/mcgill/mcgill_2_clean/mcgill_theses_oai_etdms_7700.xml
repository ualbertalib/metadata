Agitation of the ore with cyanide solution was an integral part of the first tests of the feasibillity of the new process; but in commercial application, cyanidation developed into the leaching process, because of the lack of equipment to affect the agitation and filtration.

Mnshat's patent of September 221856, for the addition of Manganese to Bessemerized metal, introduced to the World, Steel, as we know it today. Bessemer made steel by blowing air through molten iron and therebyburning out from the latter it's Silicon, Carbon and Manganese, the heat of combustion of these elaments sufficing to maintain the metal in a suitably fluid condition. The process was conducted in an acid lined vessel and no phosphorus was removed.

While such beams have hitherto been designed on the assumption that the entire load, including the weight of the encasing concrete is carried by the steel, it was thought that the steel and concerte might really act together so as to form a composite beam and that it might be practicable to arrive at some rational basis for design analogous to that employed in the case of reinforced concrete T-beams.  With this object in view two identical floor panels were built and loaded with structural steel shapes. The report of this investigation may be found in the Journal of the Engineering Institute of Canada, August, 1923.

Climatic conditions: Taking Canada for example, where there is no comparison between freight rates by sea and land, transportation of such a bulky commodity as coal, must necessarily be done during the summer months. The industrial demand for fuel is practically constant, yet the coal must be stored at hand to meet this demand throughout at least seven months of the year; this holds also for the railways. The demad for fuel for household use is also greatest during the winter months. [...]</description><creator>Billington, Edward E.</creator><contributor>Porter, J. &amp; Mackay, H.
