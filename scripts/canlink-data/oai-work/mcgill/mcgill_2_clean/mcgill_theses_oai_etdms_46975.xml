Newton succeeded in splitting up "white" light into a series of colours ordered in a certain way, called the visible spectrum. This visible spectrum has limits of wave-length 8000 Angstreem units for the red to 4000 Angstroem for the violet. These wavelengths are measured by taking advantage of the phenomenon of interference, which suggests a disturbance of wave form as in a stretched string.

These traditions have become known as folk-lore or folk-song, depending upon whether they are told or sung. They are passed on orally from generetion to generation. Gradually by means ofscribes these stories of events and heroes are written down and form the background of a nation's literature much of which is mythical, especially when it attempts to account for the beginnings of the race.

Divers methods have been used by investigators, each suited to its own particular purpose. In the case of gases, comp1ications arise owing to the existence of two speoifio heats, one at constant volume and one at constant pressure. It oocurred to Dr. Keys that certain experimental methods, which he was using for another purpose, might be adapted to the accurate determination of specific heats of gases at constant volume by the explosion method. Certain facts must be ascertained before this adaption is possible, however, and these points have engaged the attention of the writer.

With this exchange of goods there soon grew up the need for a medium of exchange, but it might even be maintained that the use of credit has preceded the the adoption of any exchange medium.

The structural alterations in those circulatory systems following upon senile changes, and the relation of such changes to the blood content of those organs, will also be dealt with. The greater part of our present day knowledge of the placenta has been derived from investigation of the growth, disposition and change in its epithelium as be fits a glandular organ.

In all times and ln all plaoes men have tried to discover why the lore of their country, both classic and popular, is interwoven with so many references to ancient gods and goddesses; to strange events, deeds. and beings; or to natural happenings influenced by unnatural agencies. Stories that treat of divinities once worshipped by Greek, Roman, Norse, or German forefathers are classic myths. Tales told bycontemporary savages are living myths. Fragments, or surviva1s of old beliefs or customs, found among uneducated people in civilized countries, are called folk-lore.

The phenomenon of electrical conductivity of gases has been noticed by experimenters as far baok as the time of Coulomb. (1) Coulomb observed that a charged conductor suspended by insulating strings would lose its charge much more rapidly than oould be accounted for by leakage over the strings. It was not until late in the nineteenth century that a logical explanation was discovered. [...]</description><creator>MacLeod, Malcolm.</creator><contributor>Keys, D. &amp; Christie, C.

Meta styrene is a colloid that swells and disperses yielding lyophilic sols not with water but with organic liquids. From the work on proteins, soaps, tannins and other substances we now have considerable knowledge of the properties of colloidal solutions where water is the dispersion medium, that is to say, hydrophilic colloids. But the class of lyophilic colloids of which meta sytrene is an example, that is organophilic colloids, has, to date, received scant attention. This is due, no doubt, to the fact that they are not as important as the hydrophilic sole which are of particular interest due to their close association with life processes.

This member, when loaded, carries a certain total stress, which, if divided by the cross-sectional area of the member, will give an average unit stress commonly called the primary stress. This assumes a uniform distribution of stress which rarely, if ever, exists. If it were possible to determine the actual stress existing in any particular fibre, by measuring the strain in that fibre, it would, in general, differ from the Primary Stress. Secondary Stress, as considered in this paper, is defined as the difference between the Primary Stress in any fibre and the stress actually existing in that fibre.

It is at once a blessing and a curse to huumanity. Without friction, man would be unable to control his movements and continue his existence; yet, because of its presence, he is using up the greater part of his energies. Thus, there are benefits derived from friction which are accepted as a matter of course and with few expressions of appreciation; but at the same time, the action of friction imposes a burden upon man which he carries with a continual struggle and frequent protest. The writer of this essay, following a very human course, will say no more about the virtues of friction, but wi11 consider some of its faults.
