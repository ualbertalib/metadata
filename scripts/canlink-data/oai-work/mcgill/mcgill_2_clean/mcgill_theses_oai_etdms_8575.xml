O. Cooper in the Hydraulic Laboratories of McGill University. When a new hydraulic turbine or one of unusual proportions is being developed, the present day practice is to build a model of the turbine for operation in a testing flume, and to use the results from this to design the fullsized unit. It has been noticed that tests performed on large turbines built homologous with existing models generally show higher efficienaies than those obtained with the models.

Yet if one so construes this short history to include the period of the last half century or so, one finds that it has seen changes which, if they seem at first sight to have been trifling, have been none the less significant and meaningful. On casting around for evidence of this fact one still meets, it is true, with much of the older terminology borrowed from philosophy, and a few of the older and more well-tried concepts. The expression 'mind' is still in use, and the mind-body controversy is not settled once and for all, but the difference, to take an example, between Sir William Hamilton's Lectures and the latest copy of the Journal of Experimental Psychology is a striking one.

The process is carried out in tanks or trays of various types and designs, but the apparatus preeminently in use for this purpose is the Dorr thickener. Slime settling fulfills a very important function in the mining industry. In the cyanide process for the recovery of gold and silver, most of the valuable solution is recovered by settling the leached ore and rock material in thickeners. In the flotation practice for the recovery of noble and base metals, concentrates are dewatered by thickening previous to filtering.

Players seeking to “fine-tune” their trombones often were forced to seek expensive and unpredictable custom modifications. Also, trombonists performing in widely different musical styles and performance settings often own a number of different instruments, each suitable for different situations (i.e. classical vs. jazz). Recently, a number of boutique trombone manufacturers have emerged, offering modular trombones as a solution to both problems. These instruments are designed with interchangeable bells, slides, valves, tuning slides, and leadpipes, which can quickly and easily be exchanged with other parts of different designs, materials, or both. This thesis examines a number of traditional (fixed) and modular trombones with two objectives. The first objective is to determine if certain combinations of modular trombones could be used to adequately emulate the sound and feel of the fixed trombones they are based on. The second objective is to examine ways in which the performer might use different modular parts to tailor their sound to their specific musical needs and aesthetic preferences. [...]</description><description>Pour la majeure partie du 20e siècle, les trombonistes ont été limité à un nombre restreint d'instruments, tous produits à la chaîne. Quoique généralement de haute qualité, ces instruments ne correspondaient pas toujours précisément à chaque musicien ou chaque situation. Les trombonistes qui désiraient avoir un trombone adapté à leurs besoins étaient forcé d'effectuer des modifications coûteuses et imprévisibles. Également, les trombonistes qui voulaient jouer dans des styles variés de musique ou dans des circonstances divergentes devaient posséder plusieurs instruments, chacun étant utilisé pour un style en particulier (ex. classique vs. jazz).Récemment, plusieurs fabricants de trombone ont fait leurs apparitions, offrant des trombones modulaires comme solution aux deux problèmes. Ces instruments sont construits avec des parties interchangeables comme la cloche, la coulisse, le barillet, les coulisses d'accords et la branche d'embouchure, qui peuvent être facilement échanger avec d'autres parties soient construits différemment, construit avec un matériel différent ou les deux combinés.Cette thèse examine quelques trombones traditionnels (fixe) et modulaire avec deux objectifs.

The first question entailed a discussion of the ideas concerning women which have controlled their lives and their education, of sex-differences, of the necessary function of women in society and the bearing of each of these on education. It was concluded that the similar educaation of men and women was preferable in all respects to sex-differentiation. In treating the second question, the objections to co-education were first discussed. Most of them were shown to arise from prejudices against women, andto bave been proved groundless by experience in mixed sohools. Finally the advantages claimed for co-education by its advocates were presented. 1) A more satisfactory emotional adjustment of the boys and girls. 2) Improved moral tone of the school. 3 Completer education of personality. 4) Better basis for mutual understanding between the sexes. 5) Training of the sexes in co-operation. 6) Improvement in economic and sooial position of women.</description><creator>Benning, Paulette.</creator><contributor>Clarke, F.

The structures throughout are compared with those of the honey bee, and closely resemble them in most cases. The lacinia of the maxilla is apparently absent. The tentorium bears a pair of dorsal arms, and the anterior and posterior arms of the two sides are connected by a V-shaped lamella. The thorax consists of the usual three segments plus the first abdominal segment or propodeum. The abdomen consists of nine segments, including the propodeum. The genital segments are invaginated within the sixth and seventh. The reproductive and digestive systems closely resemble those of the honey bee in general structure.

The following geological sequence was observed in the Quarry; beginning with the oldest rocks:- 1. Trenton limestone.2. Essexite,- coarse grained, melanocratic, varying greatly in texture. Composed essentially of titaniferous augite, magnesiohastingsi te arnphi bole, calcic plagioclase ranging from An85 to An30, with accessory olivine, titanite, magnetite and apatite. 3. Alkalic lamprophyre dykes;- black, fine-grained, composed essentially of needles of magnesiohastingsite set in a ground mass of alkali feldspars. Their relation to the essexite is not very definite.

Part I deals with the concept "standard of living", its origin, and the development of interest in such studies during the last 250 years, and classifies studies on the basis of the underlying purpose and methods used. Part II shows the results of a study made by the writer relating to a specially selected group of unskilled workers in Montreal in 1931. Part III is a general comparison of the results of some inquiries in Britain, United States and Canada into the standard of living of wage-earners.

Russell, (16., p.p. 343-344), points out that this effect has been brought about, either by the exposure of the soil to the baking heat of the sun -- as in India and in Egypt, (Prescott (15) ), or by deliberate burning ofthe soil. The increasing interest in soil science within recent years has stimulated investigation of this phenomenon from various viewpoints: evidence has accumulated to show that the beneficial effects of drying are due to changes in both the physical and the microbiological conditions of the soil.

Cure rather than prevention has frequently seemed to be the aim of man's research whether in the medical, religious, or social field. Not until comparatively recent years have men concerned themselves with causes. This has been only too true in the attitude of society towards those who oft transgress its rules. The amount of time, thought and money which the State has expended in punishing those who have committed crimes has been enormous throughout the centuries. Only within recent years have there been made any intelligent and organized effort to discover the reasons why the individual became a delinquent, and to ascertain the methods by which he may be brought into a harmonious relationship with society.

This suggestion was incorporated into the research program of the Laboratories, and Dr. H. W. Johnston from 1927 to 1929 made a preliminaryinvestigation of the penetration of liquids into Jack Pine. The results obtained were of sufficient interest to warrant further study, and from 1930 to 1932 the field has been developed by five graduate students in Physical Chemistry at McGill University working under the direction of Dr. 0.

As far as I have been able to discover, there has been very little work previously done on this subject. As a resultt the material has been collected bit by bit by going through long lists of names and writing many individual letters. In the time at my disposal I have not been able to make a very complete investigation of the subject which would entail even more elaborate communication and research. It is the idea of the Department, however, that I present what material I have been able to find, not so much as a well rounded and complete thesis but as an introduction to the subject and a fragmentary collection of notes.</description><creator>Schwab, Jean Gillespie.</creator><contributor>Leacock, S.
