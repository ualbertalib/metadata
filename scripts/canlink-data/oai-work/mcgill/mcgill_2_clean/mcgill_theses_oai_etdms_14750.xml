This recognition came in 1934 when Goldblatt demonstrated the role of the kidney in the pathogenesis of a certain type of hypertension (2) and especially after it appeared that the renal pressor substance might be involved in the pathogenesis of experimental and human hypertension. Thereafter, for many years, the renin-angiotensin system became closely and almost exclusively associated with the field of hypertension.

It is underlain almost entirely by Precambrian rocks but contains a few occurrences of a Paleozoic formation. The oldest rocks are part of a volcanic- sedimentary assemblage which occurs in the southwest along a N.60o- E.-trending belt. The volcanics, consisting of andesite, dacite, hornblende rock, rhyolite, quartz-feldspar porphyry, tuff and agglomerate, contain interlayered lenses of greywacke, iron formation and siltstone. The hornblende rock represents, in most places, the coarsergrained portions of thick lava flows, but it may in some instances be of magmatic origin. The volcanic-sedimentary rock sequence is isoclinally folded along east-west, or nearly so, axes, and it dips steeply to the south. The volcanics are altered and somewhat recrystallized, and the mineral assemblage is that of the lower amphibolite facies and, in places, that of the upper greenschist facies.

These minerals have a wide geographic distribution and occur in several geological environments. The spectacular ores at the gold and silver mining camps of Cripple Creek, Colorado, Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, and Sacarambu and Offenbanya in Transylvania consisted of telluride mineralization. Gold-silver tellurides are also present as minor constituents in some sulphide ore deposits and quartz-vein-type gold deposits.

Relatively little attention has been paid to another area receiving visual projections: the cortex of the cerebellum. That such an optically active area exists has been known for more than twenty years (Gerard, Marshall, &amp; Saul, 1936; Snider &amp; Stowell, 1942) and the distribution (Snider &amp; associates, 1942-1958), form (Koella, 1959), and sensitivity to drugs (Berry et al., 1959; Haft et al., 1961; Koella, 1959) of visually evoked potentials in this structure have been investigated.

For those who are by nature combative Snow--a former physicist of brilliance, as well as a stern reviewer of fiction, popular novelist and active politician--has provided some of life's more tolerable moments. Snow has outraged critics with his opinions on the modern novel. He has outraged literary historians and assorted critics with his opinions on the Industrial Revolution, the polarization of the literary and scientitic cultures, and the desirable course of present day education. He continues to delight and outrage critics with his novels. [...]</description><creator>Boytinck, Paul W.</creator><contributor>MacLennan, H.
