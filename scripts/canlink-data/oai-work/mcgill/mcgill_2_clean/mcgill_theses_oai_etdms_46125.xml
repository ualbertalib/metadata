The investigation covers a large range of variations in temperature and in concentration. The above is a concise statement of the experimental side of the problem. The development of new experimental technique for making these measurements had, of course, a theoretical objective, viz. an elucidation of the equilibria existing in these systems, especially as there is an intensely practical side to this elucidation. To make this clear it is necessary to elaborate on previous investigations undertaken in this laboratory which culminated in the work to be described.

A research body, the Canadian Pioneer Problems Committee, whose members are on the Staffs of Canadian Universities, was formed for the express purpose of directing the Canadian part of the programme. A five-year project is under way and it includes a survey of social and economic conditions in selected areas of the Prairie Provinces. The survey is a direct outcome of a growing body of opinion that foundations ought to be laid for a science of settlement.

The reasons may well be that, in the first place, the old anatomists and physiologists were naturally interested in studying the histology of the elements of so active an organ,and, secondly, specific staining methods were comparatively undeveloped and therefore were relatively unreliable. Still, it is interesting to note that Langhans quite accurately stated, as early as 1866, that the new tissue in the intima in arteriosclerosis consisted largely of elastic fibres.

Its scope has been further limited to those issues arising out of the constitution, organization and functioning of the government. This involves the question of administration and the struggle between Assembly and Executive for its control, as well as relations with the mother country and with Upper Canada. The closely related fields of law, land settlementand education have not been included. The object has been to bring out Neilson's views on these questions in the belief that they contribute to an understanding of the period.

In 1931 an examination of these records revealed that the infested animals were becoming more numerous and an investigation became desirable. At that time it was uncertain whether the parasites present were of one species, Fascioloides magna, which had been reported from that district in 1923 or were F. magna and Fasciola hepatica.

In a broad sense, much is already known about the mechanism and peculiarities of hydrogenation, and process control is largely scientific, there is not, however, sufficient available information covering any one phase of the extensive field of hydrogenation. In view of this fact, it was decided to investigate some of the fundamental aspects of catalytic hydrogenation.
