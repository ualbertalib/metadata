Here is a present day, practical problem, much in the public eye and mind, much experimented upon, much discussed and very much more theorized about. However, in conformity with what has been said thus far, we wish to pursue this investigation in the manner of a personalistic analysis. We are not Interested, here, in the comparative efficiency of one method over the other as a general law applied to individuals. We are interested in the individual, in his happiness, his well- being, his future, his morale and how competition and co-operation affects him in these ways.</description><creator>Gottheil, Edward L.</creator><contributor>Kellogg, C.

The generator is designed to be used principally for acceleration of ions or protons for use in nuclear reactions. Voltages of this nature may be used quite efficiently for producing low energy neutrons in a deuteron-deuterium reaction. Other reactions which are of interest in this r√§nge are the proton-lithium, protonboron and proton-fluorine reactions. (10). In addition to the above uses, the generator may be used in any apparatus which requires high DC potentials but does not draw more than a few hundred microamperes. The apparatus is of a semi-portable nature capable of being transported from one room to another like a laboratory tool. This portability is a radical departure from previous apparatus of this type. The circuit used is a form of the Cockcroft- Walton (6) or Greinacher (7) voltage multiplier.</description><creator>Goldman, Leonard Manuel. </creator><contributor>Terroux, E.

Percentages of each species in the crop, by weight, as well as their actual and expected yields were computed. Data show evidence of the complexity of phenomena involved in5 the competition between s-necies in mixture, brought about by such factors as varieties, proportions, stations and vears. Gains in one species were made usually at the other1s detriment. The barlev species has benefited generally from being grown in mixture. Mixtures have given yields intermediate between those of pure crops. However, some results indicate the possibility of yield increases with selected varieties in some districts. Notwithstanding the fact that growing barley and oat mixtures does not definitely increase yields, the practice is acceptable.</description><creator>Gauthier, Fernand M. </creator><contributor>Lods, E.

Notre travail se propose un triple hut: 1) exposer les principales methodes qui furent e1aborees au cours de ces annees, tout en notant ce qui, &amp; notre avis, fait leur valeur et leur faiblesse; 2) indiquer ce que chacune de ces methodes a apporte en fait de progres reel a la methodologie de l'enseignement des langues vivantes; 3) faire ressortir, enfin, les principes pedagogiques qui, selon nous, reposent sur les plus solides arguments et qui sont admis du plus grand nombre des methodologistes.

It was hoped that the electrographic abnormality induced would represent the latent pattern of the individual patient. Control records in non-epileptic individuals if negative would add further importance to the significance of a negative electroencephalogram in a non-epileptic functional disturbance.

The odontoblast method of bioassay was compared with two chemical methods of assay, the indophenol method of Hochberg, Melnick and Oser and the phenylhydrazine method of Roe and Gesterling. The ascorbic acid potencies of nine vitamin C carriers, assayed biologically in this laboratory and chemically in the Department of Chemistry, served as a basis for this comparison. These assay materials included six fortified juices, freshly opened, and opened and stored apple juices, tomato juice, and three canned orange juices fortified in varying proportions; and three unfortified juices, high and low potency tomato juices and canned orange juice. Statistical analysis of the chemical and biological potencies of fortified and unfortified juices indicated that chemical methods underestimated the biological potencies of the fortified juices. The two chemical methods agreed closely in the estimation of vitamin C potencies of all juices, and satisfactorily estimated the biological potencies of unfortified juices.</description><creator>Crook, Helen Gertrude. </creator><contributor>Crampton, E.

In this method, the Chamber is filled with deuterium gas and the gamma rays to be measured are allowed to pass through the Chamber. The lengths of the proton tracks resulting from the photodisintegration of the deuterium are measured. From the lengths of these tracks, the energy of the protons can be found by means of the r√§nge energy relation. From this energy, and the fact that the neutron resulting from the photodisintegration will have the same energy, and the known binding energy of the deuteron, the energy of the incident gamma ray can be calculated.[...] </description><creator>Clarke, Robert Lee.</creator><contributor>Terroux, F.
