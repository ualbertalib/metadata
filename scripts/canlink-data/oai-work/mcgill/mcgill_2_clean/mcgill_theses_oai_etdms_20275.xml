The system is required to perform, in real time, four basic speech transformations: time-scale modification, frequency-scale modification, pitch modification, and spectral envelope modification. It is based on the sinusoidal representation of Quartieri and McAulay, but achieves the required deconvolution of the speech signal by liner prediction, rather than homomorphic filtering. The system is implemented in software, and a detailed study is done to determine the type of hardware implementation required to perform the speech transformations in real time. The proposed implementation is a multiprocessor system based on the TMS320C25 digital signal processor. Results obtained on an emulator for the TMS320C25 demonstrate the ability of the system to analyze and synthesize the speech signal in real time, while results obtained by simulation demonstrate its transformation capabilities.</description><creator>Joly, Yvan</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</subject><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Audiology.</subject><title>A digital speech transformation system for developing aids for the hearing impaired /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gx41mk22j.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bc386k55n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hm50ts76h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:42:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The iconostasis is the most characteristic feature of the Orthodox Church. The metaphysical conception of the space of the church prompted its emergence, and the mystical interpretation of the Liturgy determined its evolution. These aspects were reflected in the iconographic program of the iconostasis. The sanctuary doors are the only part of the Patmian iconostases bearing figurative decoration. The study of the themes on the doors reveals an iconographic program with strong liturgical character. Furthermore, this program encompasses the entire range of the mystical symbolism pertaining to the iconostasis. The analysis indicates that the doors are instrumental in the function of the iconostasis as a liturgical device aiming at a greater unity between the earthly and the divine realms.</description><creator>Kellaris, Georgios</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Iconostases -- Greece -- Patmos Island</subject><subject>Christian art and symbolism -- Greece -- Patmos Island</subject><subject>Church decoration and ornament -- Greece -- Patmos Island</subject><subject>Orthodox Eastern Church</subject><subject>Church doors -- Greece -- Patmos Island</subject><title>The iconography of sanctuary doors from Patmos and its place in the iconographic program of the Byzantine iconostasis /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z890rv60v.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hm50ts76h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Art History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5999n4508</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:42:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis describes the evolution of Trellis Coded Modulation (TCM) technique and then develops the Analytically Described Trellis Codes with Partially Overlapped Signal Constellation for AWGN channels.

The enzymes catalyse the sequential interconversion of tetrahydrofolate derivatives required for purine, methionine and thymidylate synthesis. A Chinese hamster ovary cell line, reported to have reduced cyclohydrolase activity, was studied to characterize the nature of its mutation. Enzymatic assays showed reduced activities of all three enzymes. Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation of radiolabelled cell extracts indicated that the gene product was greatly reduced or absent in the mutant. Southern analysis showed no differences between normal and mutant cells, indicating that the defect was not due to a major gene rearrangement. RNA analysis, by Northern blotting and by RNA amplification using the polymerase chain reaction, showed that a mRNA for MTHFD of normal size was present in mutant cells. These results suggest that the mutation is post-transcriptional and that it disrupts the synthesis of MTHFD.</description><creator>Mascisch, Allegra</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Cell lines.</subject><subject>Protein deficiency.</subject><subject>Folic acid.</subject><title>Characterization of a CHO cell line deficient in the folate-dependent trifunctional protein, MTHFD</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kh04dq78g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s4655h79h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5q47rp793</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:42:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A compost consisting 95% of the sugar mill byproducts: bagasse, filter press mud, and fly ash, applied at 5 t ha$ sp{-1}$, increased vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal infection of sugarcane roots in one of three experimental fields in Barbados. In a plant cane field, compost stimulated formation of intracellular hyphal coils and arbuscules, but not vesicles or hyphae. Infection was greater in roots 35 cm and 65 cm than 5 cm distant from the plant stem, and compost effects were not significant at 5 cm. Two other sources of phosphorus, filter press mud and triple superphosphate, did not affect and suppressed mycorrhizal infection, respectively. Two ratoon crops showed no residual effect of compost on mycorrhizal infection. Compost also stimulated tillering, phosphorus content, and perhaps yield of cane, but did not differentially effect high versus low tillering or sloped versus flat areas.

After first introducing the problem to be discussed, it examines relevant aspects of four interrelated disciplines: tafsir, i'jaz al-qur'an, Arabic literary theory and criticism, as well as Arabic grammar. Then the thesis explores the specific understanding of brevity according to the third/ninth century literary critic and exegete, Ibn Qutayba (d. 276/889), as found in the chapter of ellipsis and abbreviation (bab al-hadhf wa'l-'ikhtisar) in his Ta'wil mushkil al-qur'an (The Interpretation of the Difficulties of the Qur'an) as a representative example of this relationship. Through this examination of brevity, the thesis argues that the evaluative process involved in the stylistic demonstration of the Qur'an's inimitability, like the formal discipline of Arabic literary theory and criticism, possesses its technical origins within the philological Quranic studies of formative Muslim exegesis.</description><creator>MacKay, Floyd W.</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Ibn Qutaybah, ʻAbd Allāh ibn Muslim, 828-889?

In these, Tremblay deals with the phenomena of human nature as it unfolds between birth and death. The gradual emergence of the wholeness and uniqueness of the individual during this process is a major theme developed sequentially in these four novels. This has been clearly demonstrated and critically evaluated in this thesis both somatically by using Ovid's Theory of Metamorphosis and psychologically by using Jung's Theory of Individuation. It has been concluded as a result of such analyses; firstly, that the unfolding process of human nature is a central theme, and secondly, these four novels are importantly interrelated in the development of this theme.</description><creator>Morin, Claude</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Tremblay, Michel, 1942- -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><title>L'émergence de l'individualité dans les romans de Michel Tremblay</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jq085m34h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fj236319j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:47429b415</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis presents a new parallel algorithm for solving the linear programming problem in $R sp{d}$ for the reconfigurable mesh architecture and for the CREW PRAM model. The algorithm is based on the sequential technique discovered independently by Megiddo (Meg83, Meg84) and by Dyer (Dye84, Dye86), which gives a linear time algorithm, in n, the number of constraints, to solve the linear programming problem in d variables, when d is fixed. The parallel algorithm runs in O(log$ sp3$n) time in $R sp2$, $O(n sp{1/3}$log$ sp3$n) time in $R sp{3}$ and in $O(n sp{1/2}$) time in $R sp{d}$ on the reconfigurable mesh of size n. A simplified version of the same algorithm runs in O(log$ sp{d}$n) time on the CREW PRAM. The o($n sp{1/2}$) running times achieved by the parallel linear programming algorithm in $R sp{2}$ and $R sp{3}$ are due to a novel selection algorithm, which is also presented in this thesis. The selection algorithm runs in O(log$ sp3$n) time on the reconfigurable mesh. As is the case with the sequential technique, it will be shown that the parallel technique can be applied towards solving other problems such as linear separability, circular separability, digital disk and the Euclidean one-center problem, and can be extended to solve quadratic programming problems, in particular finding the smallest circle separating two sets of points.</description><creator>We̜growicz, Paulina.</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Linear programming on the reconfigurable mesh and the CREW PRAM</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2v23vv40v.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/47429b415</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cv43nz264</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>An estimation method for predicting the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) of the soil was developed for common Nova Scotia soil types by examination of historical Ksat records. Detailed statistical analysis was performed to develop useful predictive models for Ksat based on soil physical properties and to determine the confidence limits for specific horizon-soil type combinations. Sensitivity analysis of the Hooghoudt equation was then performed to establish Ksat classes to which the confidence limits could be assigned to complete the development of the estimation method. Model development processes proved unsuccessful due to the influence of factors not considered by the model due to their qualitative nature. Independent field testing of the estimation method with respect to core and Guelph permeameter measurement techniques produced measured values within the same class as the estimated value 34% of the time for both techniques and values within one estimated class or less 70 and 76% of the time for core and permeameter techniques respectively.</description><creator>Murray, Gordon Bruce</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Soil permeability -- Measurement.</subject><subject>Soil permeability -- Nova Scotia.</subject><title>The development of an estimation method for the saturated hydraulic conductivity of selected Nova Scotia soils /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0z708x83c.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cv43nz264</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Renewable Resources</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fn107019s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Habitat use by sympatric black ducks (Anas rubripes) and mallards (A platyrhynchos) was studied in Abitibi, Quebec during May-August 1988 and 1989. Black duck broods preferred emergent and shrub-rich areas in both years. Mallard broods' habitat use differed from 1988 to 1989 (from emergent to shrub-emergent areas) when average water levels were higher. Diversity of habitats seems more important to rearing black ducks than to mallards. Rearing mallards seem to modify their use of habitats according to changing habitat availability. Daily survival rates differed only slightly between "species". Telemetry was used to study wetland use by six mallard and three black duck non-breeding females. Swamps were preferred whereas ericaceous shrub wetlands were avoided by both "species". Beaver (Castor canadensis) ponds were extensively used during the moulting period. Home ranges averaged 302.7 ha for black ducks and 201.2 ha for mallards.</description><creator>Carrière, Suzanne</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Habitat selection.</subject><subject>Black duck -- Habitat -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Mallard -- Habitat -- Québec (Province).</subject><title>Habitat selection by sympatric black ducks and mallards in Abitibi, Quebec</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v405sb367.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fn107019s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Renewable Resources</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6h440t59v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Four Western press agencies, together with the Soviet press agency TASS, have a virtual monopoly on the gathering and dissemination of international news.

One approach used to reduce these uncertainties is the use of pushing operations, without the use of sensors. In this thesis we first used the quasi-static assumption made by several researchers to plan trajectories of pushed sliding objects. Quasi-static pushing refers to operations in which the mass or acceleration of the object is significantly small that inertial forces are dominated by frictional forces. The travel distance of the object, which is first pushed with one point of contact before coming into contact with a second point of the pusher, is calculated. Then, we compare these trajectories with ones predicted based on a dynamical model of the system. This new model takes inertial forces into consideration and it comprises a more realistic friction model as it also includes a velocity dependent coefficient of friction factor. Results showed that predictions in terms of object rotation direction in similar in both cases, but that predictably the object rotation rate, in the dynamical system, is slower due inertial forces, and therefore a longer travel distance is needed to reorient an object.</description><creator>Consol, Christian Patrick</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Engineering, System Science.</subject><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Planning of manipulator pushing operations : dynamic simulation and analysis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cj82k8315.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fq18m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pv63g134w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A vector mode analysis of dispersion-shifted-mode triangular-index fibers with a trench is presented. The aspects considered are the total dispersion, splice losses and bending loss of such fibers as a function of the trench width and location, wavelength fluctuations, index difference, as well as core radius change. The presence of a trench has pronounced effects on the performance of these fibers, yielding combined advantages of dispersion-shifted and dispersion-flattened fibers, and also improves the splice loss and bending loss characteristics. Some fiber characteristics due to the presence of a trench found in this study are interesting and have not been noted previously. As for the fabrication aspect, the effects of the parameter variations on the fiber performance are examined in detail. Unlike other authors' results obtained using the scalar modal fields, our formulas here derived from the vector modal fields facilitate the study of the polarization dependence of the splice and bending losses. For weakly guiding fibers with a small index gradient, the polarization dependence becomes negligible.</description><creator>Jiang, Jingwen</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Vector mode analysis of dispersion-shifted single-mode triangular-index fibers with a trench</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/td96k3726.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pv63g134w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mw22v662f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This paper will examine the policy of multiculturalism using a Marxist perspective. This will be achieved through an analysis of the policy of multiculturalism in two aspects. The first will be concerned with examining a set of objective factors, such as the social milieu in Canada and the activities of the state when the policy of multiculturalism was institutionalised. A historical approach as well as the examination of the policy of multiculturalism as a federal parliamentary act, between the years 1972 to 1987 will be undertaken. The second aspect of social policy analysis, in this paper will be concerned with the analysis of the subjective response of an ethnic community, the Ismaili community to the policy of multiculturalism. This will be achieved through a discussion and analysis of a quantitative study conducted to assess the attitude of the Ismaili community in Toronto to different aspects of the policy. Key Marxist concepts as well as Berger and Luckmann's paradigm on social constructionism will be utilised as a framework through which the analysis of the policy of multiculturalism will be conducted.</description><creator>Moosa-Mitha, Mehmoona</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Cultural pluralism -- Canada.</subject><subject>Marxian school of sociology</subject><title>The policy of multiculturalism, 1972-1987 : a Marxist perspective</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pz50gx32d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mw22v662f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z890rv62d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The thesis is mainly on EEC regulation of cabotage. Cabotage is carriage of passengers or goods within the territory of one State by a carrier from another State. The thesis describes the EEC regulation of air, maritime and road transport and the positions of the different Member States. One of the aims of the thesis is to examine whether a common EEC transport policy already now--before the conclusion of the Internal Market in 1992--is in existence. The thesis also examines whether the three transport modes are so different that it is impossible to talk about a multi-modal EEC cabotage policy. The emphasis of the thesis is on air transport, especially air cabotage and the EEC Member States' international treaty obligations, and the EEC-North America relationship.</description><creator>Holm, Lisbet Lykke</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Transportation.</subject><subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</subject><title>EEC regulation of extra-national traffic in air, maritime and road transport</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x346d539p.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rv62d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9c67wp033</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Lac Raudot complex is an Fe rich layered troctolite-anorthosite intrusion located in the Grenville province of southern Quebec. Corona textures developed between plagioclase and olivine indicate the Lac Raudot complex must have equilibrated at pressures of at least 6 to 8 kbar corresponding to depths greater than 15 km. The crystallization sequence of the layered series is olivine, followed by plagioclase and then ulvospinel. The mineralogy and chemistry of the layered series indicate differentiation by crystal fractionation along an Fe enrichment trend with olivine compositions varying from Fo 72 at the base of the layered series to Fo 57 at the top. Plagioclase appears as a liquidus phase at an olivine composition of Fo 68, and ulvospinel at an olivine composition of Fo 64. The CMB composition is unusually Fe-rich (19-20 wt% FeO) and contains clinopyroxene but no olivine. Model calculations indicate that a parental magma of the CMB's composition is capable of producing the layered series of the Lac Raudot intrusion if an Fe+3/Fe total ratio of 0.15 is imposed. This suggests that the parental magma of the Lac Raudot intrusion was an extreme example of the Fe-rich magmas found in Proterozoic anorthosite terranes.</description><creator>Panneton, Gerald S.

The results indicated that, among previously non-lucid dreamers, a significantly greater proportion of subjects who had access to the technique reported a lucid dream. This group also reported more lucid dreams overall than the control group. For prior lucid dreamers, the technique was found to increase the number of such dreams reported, relative to baseline levels. The LDI technique was incorporated into a treatment procedure for recurrent nightmares. This treatment method was found to be effective in three individuals, although not all of them achieved a lucid dream state. The empirical and clinical findings reported are discussed with respect to previous findings and future research directions are suggested.</description><creator>Zadra, Antonio L.</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Lucid dreams.</subject><title>Lucid dreaming as a learnable skill : empirical and clinical findings</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/44558f43g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m326m295x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z029p577h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Conventional logic grammars (MG, DCG, XG, etc.) are to a certain extent biased towards analysis, and are difficult to use for synthesis purposes. We present a logic grammar formalism called Reversible Grammars (GR) suitable for both synthesis and analysis purposes. To each grammar constituent is associated not only a string, but also a semantic formula. For each grammar, two logic programs are created: an analyser and a synthesiser. The programs retain the grammar's declarative interpretation, but each one imposes a specific search order. This order is determined by the descriptions of semantic and string compositionality included in the grammar rules. A certain type of left recursion is automatically detected and eliminated by program transformation.</description><creator>Perrault, François</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Un nouveau formalisme de grammaire logique reversible /</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5425kb876.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z029p577h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vd66w102c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This memoir is made of two parts. The first part is a study of Hubert Aquin's novel Neige Noire that emphasizes the romanesque possibilities offered by intertextuality. One can see how the "mise en abyme" as an intertextual work, is well linked around Hamlet's myth, and how this myth influences various aspects in the text such as: time, themes and persons. The second part of this memoir is a story, "Oslo," that builds up an intertextual rapport with Neige Noire. The framework and the principal character in Hubert Aquin's novel infiltrate in our narrative in such a way that it establishes a mythical relation with the story, as Neige Noire with Hamlet.</description><creator>Parent, Nathalie</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Aquin, Hubert, 1929-1977.

Conrad wrestled with skepticism much as Wittgenstein later would, but his struggle with the "bewitchment" of skeptical thinking took a narratival form. His champion was Marlow, raconteur of the three novels, who recurrently loses and recovers his words and his capacity to tell (to judge, to narrate). In these works the Marlovian investigation of human convention, linguistic and otherwise, is shown to be a necessary but perilous task. The possibility that we may be dissatisfied with the ordinary or transcendental conditions of living is dramatized in all three novels, often (but not only) by threats to marriage. Heart of Darkness demonstrates the loss of linguistic attunement that may follow upon taking human relation to be a problem of knowledge, and links this to Kurtz's world-devouring repudiation of the ordinary. Chance explores in melodramatic form the "germ of destruction at the source of our strength", and unmasks men's denial of women as one face of skepticism. Lord Jim presents skepticism, Romanticism, and fantasy as different versions of ontological dissatisfaction, and shows how a return to the ordinary requires a practice of reading and remembering (our words).</description><creator>Smith, Jeremy Mark</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Skepticism</subject><subject>Conrad, Joseph, 1857-1924 -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><title>Conviction in the everyday : Joseph Conrad and skepticism</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kw52j9233.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m900nv75r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pk02cb98g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Often designated as "le poete de la parole parlee", Jacques Brault, author of a substantial and rigourous work dealing with poetry, language, writing and art, is one of the most significant modern writers of Quebec. In our literature, rare are the figurative expressions inventing their own trajectory and rarer still is the emblematic used to evoke simultaneously the essence of a generation, a work, a writer, a style. The expression "la parole parlee" says it all. This figure of speech, intimately linked to though and writing, has progressed from a rhetorical to a living expression throughout the eleven years on which our study focuses. In the analysis of this period, "la parole parlee" stands out as the obscure leitmotiv which favours a dialogue between the critical and the creative in the act of writing. Finding its own way, the work discovers a refrangible and versatile universe and the unique voice of Jacques Brault.</description><creator>Gadbois, Pauline</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Brault, Jacques, 1933- -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><title>La parole parlée dans l'oeuvre de Jacques Brault 1954-1965 /</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nv935418v.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pk02cb98g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5d86p1565</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis examines Beckett's trilogy as a work of metafiction, approaching each novel through its primary metafictional device, the self-conscious narrator. Since the narrators are aware of their roles as story-tellers, the examination is carried out in light of Beckett's pronouncements on the nature of art and the artist. Not only are the narrators found to meet Beckett's criteria for artists and artistic development, but Beckett's aesthetic is seen virtually to require self-consciousness. In their situations, their relationship to the audience (both reader and narratee) and the nature of their tales, the self-conscious narrators follow the artistic trajectory Beckett maps out in his critical writings. As Beckett's aesthetic is fulfilled, the narrators' increasing self-consciousness intensifies the metafictional aspects of the trilogy. The trilogy is thus a demonstration of Beckett's self-conscious aesthetic--a descent into reflexivity on the part of the narrators, and through the narrators, on the part of trilogy as a whole.</description><creator>Fraser, Graham, 1966-</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Beckett, Samuel, 1906-1989 -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><title>The self-conscious narrator in Beckett's trilogy /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/db78td308.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5d86p1565</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:12579t37t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Data collected from zenith pointing radar is used to study the range dependence of some meteorological radar errors associated with different sampling methods between radar and gauges in stratiform precipitation. Errors due to the vertical variation of reflectivity such as those related with the bright band or with snow growth cause a much larger bias in radar estimates than those due to beam filling or gradients. The maximum useful range varies with the bright band height and the elevation angle program used, a CAPPI giving superior results especially for snow. The sudden changes in bright band height over short distances and the large scatter of its thickness limit the accuracy of current corrections for the vertical variation of reflectivity based on scanning radar data. The possibility of using a zenith pointing radar to obtain this correction is discussed.</description><creator>Fabry, Frédéric</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</subject><title>Precipitation estimates by radar : a zenith pointing radar perspective</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n296x014j.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/12579t37t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Meteorology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5138jf94c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Mono-N-dealkyldisopyramide (MND), the major metabolite of disopyramide, reaches significant concentrations in patients; however, little is known about its electrophysiological effects. We therefore assessed its activity in canine ventricular tissue superfused in vitro. MND produced a concentration and rate dependent increase in the magnitude of V$ sb{ rm max}$ depression. MND shortened all phases of repolarization in Purkinje fibers but prolonged action potential duration and effective refractory period in ventricular muscle. We then assessed the effects of the combination of disopyramide and MND at clinically relevant concentrations. The combination produced additive effects on depression of V$ sb{ rm max}.$ MND accentuated the shortening of action potential duration in Purkinje fibers and the prolongation of refractory periods in both Purkinje fibers and ventricular muscle produced by disopyramide at normal heart rates. In contrast, at slow stimulation rates and under redisposing electrolyte conditions, disopyramide produced a reverse use-dependent prolongation of action potential duration which led to the development of early afterdepolarizations and triggered activity in Purkinje fibers. Mexiletine and pacing abolished triggered activity, while MND shifted the incidence of triggered activity to longer cycle lengths.</description><creator>Toy, William</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</subject><title>Electrophysiological interactions between disopyramide and its major metabolite, mono-N-dealkyldisopyramide, in canine ventricular tissue</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8k71nj261.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5138jf94c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0c483k51s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The effects of differing recovery patterns following intermittent exercise on blood lactate and subsequent performance were examined. Fourteen male subjects completed three randomly assigned experimental protocols.

Each protocol ended with a maximal performance task consisting of a 45s all-out cycling test. Recovery patterns included passive, cycling (45% of VO$ sb2$ max), and arm cranking (45% of VO$ sb2$ max). Results revealed similar blood lactate concentrations in the passive and arm cranking conditions but significantly lower (p $&lt;$.05) levels in the cycling condition. Mean power outputs measured from the performance task were significantly higher (p $&lt;$.05) in the cycling and arm cranking recovery conditions.
