In general, the small farms were more cost efficient while large farms were more profit efficient. Increased use of farm grown feed was associated with higher efficiency while increased use of concentrates was associated with lower efficiency. The productivity of individual dairy farms were estimated using data envelopment analysis. The average annual growth rate of productivity was 0.70% with a standard deviation of 2.44% for the 1987--93 period. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient did not show any significant relationship between farm size and growth rate. The Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) approach, used for the first time to estimate technical efficiency, performed equally as good as the regression models in modeling the technology especially at the higher levels of output. The efficiency values estimated using ANN were higher than that estimated by ordinary least squares method. The results indicate the existence of significant potential for improving the efficiency of resources on Quebec dairy farms.</description><creator>Shanmugam, Ramaradj.</creator><contributor>Gunjal, Kisan (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Dairy farming -- Economic aspects -- Québec (Province).</subject><title>Efficiency and productivity of Quebec dairy farms</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Ramaradj Shanmugam, 1998</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0k225d21r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6682x604q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Agricultural Economics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rj4306882</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:23:34Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Rabbi Joseph Bekhor Shor is a Torah commentator and a Tosafist from the twelfth century. Only a single copy of his commentary exists. This might suggests that it was not much in demand, and is confirmed by the fact that it was not published until the modern era. Nonetheless, his commentary attracted later commentators among the Tosafists in the field of Torah exegesis. Bekhor Shor's commentary demonstrates various types of linguistic features of Bible interpretation, such as, grammar, etymology, semantics, and syntax. It also deals with the style and some literary features of the Bible. Each feature presented in this study, includes extensive examples that demonstrate Bekhor Shor's use of them. Some similarities are found between the commentaries of the Tosafists and that of Bekhor Shor, considering his specific linguistic-literary features of exegesis. Possible influences on Bekhor Shor's trend of linguistic and literary exegesis of the Torah-Pentateuch text is the intellectual atmosphere of Peshat and linguistic activity in Ashkenaz in his generation, and the teachings of Ibn Ezra, Rabbenu Tam, and Rabbi Samuel Ben Meir. This study indicates, different from the generally accepted view, that Bekhor Shor dealt with various kinds of linguistic and literary exegesis in the course of his elucidation and explanation of the Torah.</description><creator>Nisan, Yael Haviva.</creator><contributor>Levy, B.

These elements can be very effective for communicating ideas that are difficult to explain with text alone. For the presentation of music, the WWW brings the capability of embedding audio files (recordings) into a document, thus providing audible musical excerpts in addition to textual references to selected points of interest in a musical score. However, there are technical challenges and copyright issues to be addressed when providing musical excerpts on the WWW. The research undertaken in this study brings one possible solution to these issues through the design and implementation of a hybrid system using a combination of the internet and commercially available audio compact discs.</description><creator>McLaughlin, Elbert H.</creator><contributor>Pennycook, Bruce (advisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Computer sound processing.</subject><title>The coalescence of music and the internet : a hybrid solution for the use of music materials in world-wide web publication</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t148fk24r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jq085n53x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x346d640n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:23:36Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Replication-defective (E1+E3 deleted) human adenovirus vectors are promising means of therapeutic gene delivery to skeletal muscle cells. Since the tropism of adenovirus is non-selective, muscle-specific expression of systemically administered vectors can only be achieved by the use of a tissue-specific promoter/enhancer that is small enough to fit the insert capacity of the vector. We have generated a replication-defective adenovirus recombinant (AV) in which the reporter gene (firefly luciferase) was driven by a truncated (1.35 kb) muscle creatine kinase (MCK) promoter/enhancer. Highly efficient and muscle-specific transgene expression was demonstrated in immunodeficient mice after local injection of AV into muscles at early age. Luciferase levels produced by AVMCKlux compared favourably to those in parallel experiments from injection of AVRSVlux in which lux expression is driven by the ubiquitously active LTR sequences of RSV. In nonmuscle tissues (brain, liver, kidney, lung), the transgene expression was extremely low even though in these tissues in situ polymerase chain reaction showed as high an infectivity of the cells by the AV as in muscle, and high levels of expression were obtained with AVRSVlux. The relatively small size, the good efficiency and the muscle specificity of the MCK promoter/enhancer would make it ideal to drive the 6.3 kb (truncated) dystrophin cDNA in first generation AV (with a limited (8 kb) insert capacity) designed for gene therapy of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</description><creator>Larochelle, Nancy.</creator><contributor>Karpati, George (advisor)</contributor><contributor>Nalbantoglu, Josephine (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Gene therapy for muscular dystrophy : evaluation of a muscle-specific promoter for adenovirus-mediated gene transfer</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/js956j071.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x346d640n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2f75r9906</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:23:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Long term care placement consists of determining an individual's need for care and services and of allocating appropriate resources. In Quebec, this laborious process includes a standardized application form. This study examined the work burden incurred and its cost to the system: Social workers in nine Montreal anglophone hospitals as well as in receiving resources were surveyed; the principal researcher of the 'Classification by types of program in extended care and service facilities' project was interviewed; the committee processing these forms was observed; Canadian hospitals were surveyed for comparison with Quebec. The findings show that the application form requires unnecessary and repetitive information-gathering which consumes excessive time to complete (5.2 hours) and incites non-adherence to guidelines. The implications for streamlining this form without loss of benefit to the patient and at a considerable saving of social work time are discussed in relation to social work practice and research.</description><creator>LaRochelle, Louisette.</creator><contributor>Duder, Sydney (advisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Older people -- Long-term care -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Long-term care facilities -- Québec (Province) -- Admission.</subject><title>The long term care placement process in Quebec : a burden for social workers?</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128ng87x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2f75r9906</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rj430689b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:23:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A series of tests was performed in winter 1996 to measure degradation of paper mulches with the help of physical and mechanical properties. Four types of paper used for mulching, kraft paper gauge 40, 60 and 80 and waxed paper were laid over soil in two growth chambers. They were kept under observation for 27 days under controlled temperature, humidity and light. Mulches were sprayed with water to simulate rain. Tensile and puncture tests were performed on each type of paper every day. Four mechanical properties; stress, strain, energy and tensile energy absorption were calculated from the force-deformation curve obtained by tensile test. Two mechanical properties; displacement and force to break were calculated from the force-deformation curve obtained by puncture test. A special die had to be designed to perform puncture tests. This design eliminated shear loading which otherwise would have been present in normal puncture tests. Results showed that paper - 3 (kraft paper gauge - 80) was best suited for mulching as the mechanical properties were stable through 27 days with negligible fluctuations. Waxed paper required less force to break but was stable through 27 days of experimentation. A three-way factorial model was developed to analyze the results statistically. A SAS program was written to model the results. The fitted model was in very good agreement with the actual values.</description><creator>Krishnamurthy, Harish.</creator><contributor>Norris, Eric (advisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Mulching.</subject><subject>Paper -- Deterioration.</subject><title>Physical and mechanical properties of paper mulches in assessing degradation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9880vt07w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rj430689b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vd66w1986</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:23:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Apoptosis has been proposed as the mechanism of neuronal cell death, while altered levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the amyloid beta peptide, a proteolytic cleavage product of APP, are believed to contribute to the neurodegeneration in AD. Thus, defining the molecular mechanisms regulating these events are of interest. The expression of the immediate early genes (IEG), in particular c-jun, has been shown to be a requirement for neuronal apoptosis. Due to the presence of activator protein-1 (AP-1) consensus sequences in the promoter of the APP gene, which has been shown to be responsive to regulation by immediate early genes, we set out to determine whether expression of the immediate early genes resulted in a correlated increase in the expression of APP during neuronal apoptosis. Apoptosis was induced in highly purified human primary neuron cultures by serum deprivation and characterized by propidium iodide and TUNEL (terminal transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling) staining to detect condensed chromatin and fragmented nuclei, distinct morphological features of apoptotic cells. Immediate early gene, c-fos and c-jun, expression was assessed at the transcriptional level by RT-PCR and immunoblotting at the protein level.

The Frasnian-Famennian paraconformity overlies the Simla Member everywhere within the study area. Basinward, this boundary becomes conformable where it overlies the Mount Hawk Formation. The F-F boundary forms the basal bounding surface for the Sassenach Formation. The early Famennian Sassenach Formation comprises mixed siliciclastic/carbonate strata that overlie, onlap and frequently toplap the underlying Mount Hawk Formation and Simla Member along the northeastern margin of the Jasper Basin. The stratigraphic relationships within the study area are not unique and may be explained by different sequence stratigraphic and depositional models. Two end member models are considered and illustrate the difficulty in distinguishing between depositional systems where accommodation space is controlled mainly by sedimentation rate (Model 1) or mainly by sea-level (Model 2). Model 1 and Model 2 represent a minimum and maximum amount of relative sea-level fall across the F-F boundary respectively.

With the aim of adapting to this new competitive environment, carriers have in the past years joined forces and developed international carriers alliances. As a result, antitrust immunity to carrier alliances was granted by the United States in order for carriers to "merge" their activities without an actual merger, prohibited under the present regime, or without risking violation of antitrust laws. This thesis will discuss the basis of antitrust immunity in the United States, as well as the different carrier alliances that have received antitrust immunity from the US Department of Transport. The European Union, and certain national authorities, are presently reviewing alliances---involving a European carrier---that received antitrust immunity in the U.S. The different issues raised by such reviews will be examined in the present thesis. Carrier alliances, antitrust immunity and open skies treaties are all closely linked. Although having involved, to date, carriers and agencies from two continents, the effects are being felt around the world. This thesis will try to describe this new relation, focusing primarily on antitrust immunity.</description><creator>Pothier, Ann Frédérique.</creator><contributor>Janda, Richard (advisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</subject><subject>Transportation.</subject><subject>Law.</subject><title>Leading international aviation towards globalization : the new relationship among carrier alliances, open skies treaties and antitrust immunity</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6d56zz76b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0g354h517</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nz8062057</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:23:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Should civil aviation reach its promising full potential, it will inevitably be through the use and reliance upon Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and its innovative technologies. At present only one option seems clearly and 'directly' operational for the civil aviation challenge, and that is a---USA owned and controlled---GPS based GNSS. This thesis will critically discuss the legal and institutional issues of the GNSS. The issues considered will be based upon the discussions and conclusions recently reached within ICAO. The object of this thesis is to compare, contrast and criticise ICAO's international law-making propositions, related to GNSS, in the fight of the 'practical reality' varying from the users' demands and expectations, passing through the lack of practical experiences, to the USA monopoly as sole basic signal provider. Whilst ICAO is undeniably a great contributor to global development of civil aviation, it seems that in the case of GNSS implementation, ICAO's role is limited by both its mandate, but equally a lack of political consensus upon potential 'solutions' to hypothetical problems. The research is based on materials and documents available by the end of May 1997 and does not take into account the later developments in ICAO discussions.</description><creator>Nicolaïdès, Dimitri P.</creator><contributor>Milde, Michael (advisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</subject><subject>Transportation.</subject><subject>Law.</subject><title>GNSS-legal and institutional issues</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3f4627621.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nz8062057</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6m311r53n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:23:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis will examine the utilization of the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) regime by Global Mobile Personal Communications by Satellite Systems (GMPCS) operators and the requirements that governments must fulfill in order to acquire orbit/spectrum resources from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) for the purpose of deploying GMPCS.

When it comes to foreign direct investment (FDI) in this area regulators have long sought to protect the industry from outside control and ownership. Recently, however, a more liberal attitude is emerging towards FDI as one which embraces this source of capital. The questions that this dissertation will try to answer are why FDI in air transport is still so strictly controlled in air transport and how it could be regulated in the future. FDI in basic telecommunications has experienced the same development as international air transport. As in aviation, basic telecommunications providers have been prevented from acquiring excessive foreign controlling capital. This year, however, basic telecommunications was brought under the General Agreement on Trade and Services (GATS). This has resulted in a decrease in the regulatory restraints against FDI. It is the contention of this dissertation that as in international basic telecommunications, FDI in international air transport should be regulated through the GATS.

The wobbling state of air law in the country after about 72 years of civil aviation's existence, and about 47 years since the evolution of a regulatory environment, bears glaring testimony to this fact. Essentially, some of the air law problems in the country are not entirely dissimilar to problems which have for over 50 years confronted the legal system of international civil aviation. This Dissertation attempts to provide an account of the nature of each air law instrument, and the source from which they derive, taking into consideration international air law requirements, the manner of their application, and a critical appraisal of their suitability to local circumstances, responsiveness to national and global changes and challenges in the economies and technologies of civil aviation.

The 1994 Summit of the Americas called for the completion of the negotiation of a Free Trade Area of the Americas no later than 2005. Given the ample recognition that investment codification is an essential complement to rules governing trade flows, the eventual incorporation of a comprehensive set of investment rules within the free trade area agreement, seems unavoidable. The inclusion of such rules within the regional trading system would constitute an extension of the recent practice of incorporating investment norms within integration and trade agreements. Precisely, at the hemispheric level, an interesting array of investment-related instruments exist, and the principles contained in them can be regarded as indicative of countries' positions concerning investment provisions. Despite a general convergence toward liberalization, differences remain among states' disposition toward investment. Significant advances have been made in the study of actual regimes in order to launch negotiations within the framework of the free trade area. The challenge thus, will be to seek common ground and reach an agreement consistent with the regional trend toward trade liberalization, and to reconcile the interests of the different sub-regions within the continent. This thesis mainly explores the current regulatory framework of foreign investment and affirms the need for comprehensive international integration of rules in this area. Further, it attempts to assess the basis upon which such a wider and deeper agreement could be achieved.</description><creator>Fernandez, Monica.</creator><contributor>Mestral, Armand L.

This balance is made by states according to their socioeconomic and political conditions. Since these conditions differ among states, another, yet more complex conflict of interests arises between states as to how the interest of air carriers and consumers should be balanced. This difference between states has been, and still is, the biggest obstacle in the way of unifying private international air law. Giving an overview of the present situation and the possible future implications, this thesis highlights the balance of interest of the successive private international air law instruments and examines the factors that lead thereto. This thesis further analyses the crisis of unified private international air law and the actions taken to confront it by examining the reasons behind it in order to understand the current situation and apprehend the future.</description><creator>Alhijazi, Yahya Z.

This thesis addresses this issue for scan-based designs by proposing a method to compress and decompress input test patterns. By storing the test patterns in a compressed format, the amount of memory required to test ICs can be reduced to manageable levels. The thesis describes the compression and decompression scheme in details. The proposed method relies on the insertion of a decompression unit on the chip. During test application, the patterns are decompressed by the decompression unit as they are applied. Hence, decompression is done on-the-fly in hardware and does not slow down test application. The design of the decompression unit is treated in depth and a design is proposed that minimizes the amount of extra hardware required. In fact, the design of the decompression unit uses flip-flops already on the chip: it is implemented without inserting any additional flip-flops. The proposed scheme is applied in two different contexts: (1) in (external) deterministic-stored testing, to reduce the memory requirements imposed on the test equipment; and (2) in built-in self test, to design a test pattern generator capable of generating deterministic patterns with modest area and memory requirements. Experimental results are provided for the largest ISCAS'89 benchmarks. All of these results point to show that the proposed technique greatly reduces the amount of test data while requiring little area overhead. Compression factors of more than 20 are reported for some circuits.</description><creator>Zacharia, Nadime.</creator><date>1996</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Compression and decompression of test data for scan based designs</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bn9998817.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9593tx31q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cv43p0389</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:23:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The wide accessibility and low cost of virtual reality (VR) on the Web with the advent of the Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML) and VRML interpreters makes it ideal for use in providing cost-effective training for operators in selected complex technical environments. VR using VRML is limited; it is not suitable for all types of training, and the cost-effectiveness of deploying VRML-based virtual environments (VEs) is often impeded by high development time and cost. This thesis examines the potential of using VRML to implement VEs for training in suitable tasks, and demonstrates that this potential can be fulfilled using an appropriate, reuse-driven design. To this end, state-of-the-art work in VR training and Web-based applications are investigated. The role of expert systems and intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) in imparting expertise, and the architectures of interactive systems are also examined. VRML's limited ability to model abstract, complex concepts, and the need for a reusable design or framework in developing cost-effective learn-by-doing systems are then addressed in an initial prototype application. SEDA-VRML is a VRML-based learn-by-doing system developed for the training of maintenance workers in the troubleshooting and inspection of power transformers.

As well, an extensive method to quantify the system's accuracy and reliability is detailed within. A data acquisition system measures lumbar motion associated with exercises similar to daily activities (gait, ranging, and load lifting). This involves a minimally invasive procedure to insert pins into three spinous processes of the lumbar vertebrae. Three-dimensional electromagnetic position sensors are attached to these pins and stereo radiographs provide the calibration offsets necessary for the calculation of spinal segmental motion from the sensor data. Analysis software was written to aid researchers in extracting descriptive statistics and by displaying 2-D graphs of the segmental motion. As an adjunct to the analysis software, a method was developed to visualise the subject's kinematics using 3-D computer animation. This requires the subject to undergo magnetic resonance volume scans which yields vertebral surface data. This data and the previously acquired kinematics from the same person is combined through computer animation resulting in an intuitive visualisation of their spine's motion.</description><creator>Rubin, Richard K.</creator><contributor>Peters, Terry (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Aebi, Max (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Biology, Anatomy.</subject><subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</subject><title>Three-dimensional measurement and visualisation of human lumbar kinematics</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0v838268d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fj236425w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biomedical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3484zj86g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:23:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The goal of this thesis was to generate stereo views of three dimensional objects lit by speckle light. Four basic geometric objects were simulated using a finite element method. The intent was to create the objects such that both the aspect and the statistical properties of the images are similar to those of the same object viewed by a camera. Therefore the probability density function and the autocorrelation function of the intensity distribution were calculated only for a plane and a sphere. The simulations showed good results in the far field case, with cameras parallel to each other and an attached light. In the end a more general method is proposed, for the situation where the light and cameras are close to the object, cameras are not parallel and the light may move independently from the cameras.</description><creator>Petre, Valentina.</creator><contributor>Galiana, H.

The downlink of the IS-95 cellular CDMA standard is an example of such a system. The channel coding performance of the IS-95 downlink is simulated and the signal to interference ratio at the mobile is evaluated. Alternative channel coding schemes aimed at increasing the number of orthogonal channels or improving the bit error rate are analyzed and their bit error performance is simulated. In orthogonal CDMA, the coding and modulation have to be designed in such a way that users transmit on orthogonal channels. We show that the system bandwidth of the system has to be shared between the two tasks of coding and maintaining channel orthogonality. A formula relating the number of orthogonal channels and the lowest attainable value of coding rate per channel is presented. The lowest attainable coding rate is shown to be an increasing function of the number of orthogonal channels in the system. The relation proves to be particularly important since an increase in the number of channels induces a decrease in signal to interference ratio at the mobile and an increase in coding rate reduces the potential coding gain. Taking into account those constraints, a system with 20 more orthogonal channels and having the same bit error performance as the IS-95 system is presented. It is shown that the increase in capacity comes at the expense of an increase in channel coding complexity. In the last part of this thesis, we evaluate the highest reachable number of orthogonal channels in a perfectly power-controlled orthogonal CDMA system. This value is based on the Shannon capacity for the bandlimited AWGN channel. It provides an indication of the achievable number of orthogonal channels and the channel coding complexity to maintain reliable transmission. The highest reachable number of orthogonal channels is evaluated assuming a worst case and average interference scenario and various values of path loss exponent. Finally a similar calculation of the highest reachable number of orthogonal channels taking into account the fading is carried out.</description><creator>Mehio, Rami.</creator><contributor>Leib, H.

This thesis discusses previous work in the field of haptic devices, the research into the bonding of metals. to composites, optimization procedures for composite laminates, and includes a brief overview of human haptic capabilities. The discussion includes the analysis process used to design a composite box-beam structure to replace one link of the translation stage of the hand controller, and to determine the optimal bond characteristics for the joining of a small diameter composite tube to a metal end fitting. Iterative finite element analysis as well as failure and vibration testing were used to determine the efficiency of the designs, and to measure the improvements in the dynamic properties of the haptic device's structure. Though certain difficulties were encountered during the manufacturing of the prototype that lead to disappointing physical test results, the simulations prove that a haptic device such as the Freedom-7 could greatly benefit from the inclusion of composite materials into the structure.</description><creator>McDougall, John, 1972-</creator><date>1997</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Design of a composite link for the Freedom-7 Haptic Hand Controller</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5425kc864.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zc77ss09m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1831cn09b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:23:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this study, the reaction kinetics and mechanism of kraft pulping with polysulfide and anthraquinone(AQ) using black spruce wood were investigated. In preliminary studies, the synergistic effect of polysulfide and AQ on pulp yield improvement was verified by different methods. The identical kinetic cooking experiments were conducted for Kraft, Kraft-AQ, Polysulfide, and Polysulfide-AQ processes in the temperature range between 151 and 180ºC. It was found that the delignification rate of the PSAQ process was the fastest. The activation energies of delignification of Kraft, Kraft-AQ, Polysulfide, and Polysulfide-AQ processes were calculated as 141, 131, 142, and 131 kJ/mol, respectively. Based on obtained activation energies, the Vroom's H-factor was calculated and compared. It was also found that Kraft, Kraft-AQ, Polysulfide, and Polysulfide-AQ processes had similar activation energies for the carbohydrate degradation by 170, 174, 176, and 181 kJ/mol. Compared with the kraft process, the carbohydrate degradation rate of the PSAQ process was reduced. In addition, compared with other processes the PSAQ process had the best pulping selectivity. A mechanism was proposed for the synergistic effect of polysulfide and anthraquinone on kraft pulp yield improvement based on the experimental evidence. It suggested that the synergy takes place at the beginning of heating-up period, polysulfide improves AQ penetration into wood, and therefore the maximum reduction of anthraquinone is reached earlier. The accelerated delignification helps the polysulfide to better access the hemicellulose, and that leads to more efficient stabilization of carbohydrates. In the meantime AQ retards the decomposition of polysulfide, and a higher concentration of polysulfide in the cooking liquor further prevents the degradation of carbohydrates. A redox cycle similar to that of AQ was proposed for the polysulfide.</description><creator>Li, Zhijun, 1965-</creator><date>1997</date><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Improving the kraft pulp yield with polysulfide and anthraquinone</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v979v5080.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1831cn09b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q811km89k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:23:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The properties of plastics products are governed by their crystallinity and morphology. In order to study the effects of processing shear stresses on crystallization behavior, a fiber pullout technique was applied in conjunction with polarized light microscopy and a hot stage. The shear apparatus consists of a single glass fiber sandwiched between two layers of polypropylene films mounted on the hot stage. At the crystallization temperature, shearing was introduced by pulling the fiber at a constant velocity for a fixed period of time. Static crystallization of the polymer then ensues. Computerized data acquisition and image analysis were employed to observe the evolution of crystallinity, morphology, and growth rates of crystallites, in various shear and temperature fields. Two distinct morphological zones were produced upon fiber pullout: bulk spherulites and a shear-induced layer localized within the vicinity of the fiber surface. The two zones displayed similar kinetic behavior despite the difference in appearance. Comparison of growth behavior in the two zones revealed rates independent of the shear rate but strongly dependent on crystallization temperature. Such a behavior in the shear-induced layer suggests the existence of different growth regimes for a range of shear rates. Only when the critical shear rate is surpassed is there a substantial increase in the growth rate of the shear-induced layer.</description><creator>Lee, Oi Wun.</creator><contributor>Kamal, M. R.

However, validation of in vivo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) studies is complicated by a lack of 'absolute truth' or reference data. This thesis describes an extensible MRI simulator that efficiently generates realistic 3D images of human brain anatomy, using a 3D brain phantom with known anatomical structures and tissue properties. An object-oriented design is presented that allows simulator models to be adapted to specific studies. Models for discrete-event Bloch equation simulation of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) signal production, scan parameter dependent noise, and partial volume are given. The simulator is validated using doped-gelatin phantom experiments, and its application to common medical imaging tasks, such as, image registration, classification, nonuniform intensity correction, and fMRI analysis is shown.</description><creator>Kwan, Remi K.-S.</creator><contributor>Pike, G.
