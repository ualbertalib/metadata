Hopkins in 1921, iso1ated from yeast cells a low molecular weight sulfur containing substance which he named "glutathione". Finding that the compound gave a positive nitroprusside reaction and contained glutamic acid and cysteine he concluded that it probably was a dipeptide of these amino acids. Eight years later Hunter and Eagles questioned the validity of the dipeptide structure and Hopkins was prompted to reinvestigate the constitution of the compound. With the aid of cuprous oxide as a reagent he was able to isolate glutathione as a copper derivative and from it to isolate glutathione itself in a crystalline form. On further analysis he found the substance to be a tripeptide consisting of glutamic acid, cysteine and glycine. Soon afterward Pirie and Pinhey performed for the first time the electrometric titration of the ionizable groups in glutathione and proposed the correct structure of the compound. This finding was confirmed by degradation studies and by the synthesis of the compound by Harington and Mead. [...]</description><creator>Mathai, Claramma K.</creator><contributor>Denstedt, O.

He noted the appearance of four bands in the visual spectrum upon simple chemical reduction and their disappearance after reoxidation. In muscle, he regarded this substance as separate and distinct from haemoglobin (myoglobin) and he concluded that it was involved in cellular respiration.

The approximation consists of replacing three particle states by states containing two particles, one of which is a resonance between two of the original three; the resonance is regarded as an ordinary stable particle. The approximation is tested in a modified form of the Lee model, which is sufficiently simple to admit explicit calculation and comparison of "exact" and "resonance approximation" cross sections. the indication of this model calculation is that the approximation is a reasonably good one. </description><creator>Luke, Trevor MacDonald.</creator><contributor>Margolis, B.

One of these, the isolation and characterization of the constituents of nervous tissue, had its beginnings over eighty years ago in the laboratory of J.L.W. Thudicum, the "Father of Neurochemistry". The other path has led to studies of the metabolism of nervous tissue, both in vitro and in vivo. It is the aim of most neurochemists to bring these two divergent paths into a closer alignment in arder to gain inaight into the unique function of this important tissue. The studies described in this thesis also follow two different paths.

The general region of validity in the L-plane is defined. Using a simplified trial wave function, a number of calculations are then performed for various strengths of an attractive Yukawa potential and the results plotted as Regge curves. In order to check the numerical calculations for large and very small energies, a derivation of asymptotic formulae for each trajectory is also included, together with several tables of resulta. It is found that the variational method is useful and relatively simple, but less accurate than other existing techniques.

Among these applications, power generation for electricity and propulsion is most important. As the uses of these materials increase, so does the number of transactions, especially among nations. To preserve energy and to save time and money, certain radioactive materials are transported by air and as nuclear activity advances, so will the number of air carriages. To provide for economic and distant space travel, experiments have been undertaken to develop nuclear power propulsion in flight instrumentalities, both in spacecraft and aircraft, in order to overcome the difficulties of chemical fuels. Because of the ultrahazardous nature of the materials and the potential catastrophic damage involved, attention has been given to the question of liability.

The method fits an integral equation model to the observed input and output of the process using the principle of least squares. The model parameters together with the initial conditions of the output are determined simultaneously without requiring a test signal. This method has been applied to identify various types of process dynamics, including three hand-drawn unit-impulse responses, by simulation on a digital computer. During this study both the a priori knowledge and the output signal-to-noise ratio of the process were varied. A process con be accurately identified within a fraction of its settling time for a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio at the output. For the case of using a model with more parameters than necessary, the estimates of the unwanted parameters are approximately zero, provided that (a) the noise level is low, and (b) all these unwanted parameters are in either the numerator or the denominator of the model transfer function. Also, a relatively fast time-varying process has been successfully identified in the presence of noise. The results indicate that this method is particularly effective when low order models are selected. [...]</description><creator>Lee, Howard Chong.</creator><contributor>Milsum, J. H.

In the theoretical phase of this investigation, the dynamics of the combustion products behind a cylindrical detonation wave is analysed by extending the Taylor-Zeldovich model of the spherical case. Based on the conservation of mass, it is shown that when the reaction zone thickness is not small compared to the radius, a steady detonation wave cannot exist. A study of the initiation mechanisms of a cylindrical detonation wave shows that it must be initially over-driven and for large radius, the Chapman-Jouguet hypothesis is satisfied. In the experimental phase of this investigation, the detonation velocities in acetylene-oxygen mixtures with different chemical compositions (20% - 60% acetylene by volume) are determined by using ionization probes. The critical energy for spark ignition is also determined. Vertical slit streak photographs and pressure measurements are taken at different radii from the ignition source to verify that the cylindrical detonation wave is initially over-driven. Pressure measurements of the combustion products are also taken and compared with the theoretical values based on the similarity solution. The problem of transition from cylindrical deflagration to detonation, and the phenomena of spinning and pulsations are also investigated.

This has meant a serious loss of business which has led to many financial difficulties. This loss of a share of the market has come about despite the lasting importance of the railways generally in the economy, despite their necessity in economic development and despite their continued progress in technology. Should the railway situation continue to deteriorate, transportation systems could be endangered seriously. In this thesis, a reform of railway pricing policies is proposed as an important contribution to the solution of the present railway problem.
