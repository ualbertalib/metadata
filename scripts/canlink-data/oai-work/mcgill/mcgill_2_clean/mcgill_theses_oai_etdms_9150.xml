Such a review of cerebral cicatrixin its manifold forms and causations should help in an understanding of the histological processes involved. Furthermore, careful analysis and theapplication of experimental methods should help to differentiate and to identity the late changes which follow cerebral insults of one form oranother. Finally, a clearer understanding of the mechanism of production of the various end results of cerebral insults may guide the way toimprovement in therapeutic measures, both medical and surgical. The work included in this report has been carried on over a period of five years.At the outset the attack was made upon the isolated problem of post-traumatic cerebral cicatrix and an effort was made to deter.mine. what factorsgoverned healing, so that one might employ methods of scar excision which would permit of the surgeon leaving less soar than the one which he wasremoving in the effort to cure the patient of his posttraumatic epilepsy.

It has been shownthat low (6 percent) and high of carbon dioxide (53 percent) concentrations/stimulate and depress respectively the respiratory activity of fruitsduring a period of six days. Low concentrations of oxygen (l percent) increased the output of carbon dioxide of apples; when these fruits werereturned to air the rate of oxygen uptake was found to be lower than in those fruits stored continuously in air. Fruits which had been stored in 5percent and 10 percent carbon dioxide at 3-5 C for several months and removed to 21 C were observed to respire more rapidly than the controls storedin air. Moisture loss and the size effect were noted. Golden Russet apples lost three times as much moisture as carbon dioxide by weight, and theloss of these constituents from fruits varied inversely as the size. The carbon dioxide loss and transpiration were greatly increased in applesaffected with physiological breakdown. [...]</description><creator>Eaves, C. A.</creator><contributor>Scarth, G.

Reproducibility of the results has been obtained and a method capable of giving high accuracy has been developed. Theeffect of stannous chloride and the rate of the reaction have been defined much more accurately than before. It has been shown that the maximumcolor intensity is developed at about 5 minutes after the addition of the reducing agent. Both ferric and ferrous iron have been shown to interferewith the reaction; ferric iron causes rapid fading at concentrations exceeding 6-10 p.p.m.; ferrous iron diminishes the color development if thestannous chloride reagent is not added immediately after the acid molybdate reagent. The use of light of a definite portion of the spectrum,approximating monochromatic light, has shown that Beer's law is followed by the reaction, both in pure solutions and in soil extracts. It has beenshown that the reaction is strictly applicable to the analysis of soil extracts of various kinds, yielding results of the most quantitative nature.</description><creator>Dyer, William John.</creator><contributor>Wrenshall, C.

Anterior pituitaries comprised the chief material used.The lipids were extracted, separated and purified as far as possible by solvent fractimation and then were purified further by other means. The lipid groups isolated included theneutral fats and nonsaponifiable fraction, phospho-lipids, glrcolipids, sterols, carotenoid pigments and miscellaneous fractions. Wherever advisablethese were analyzed for nitrogen, phosphorus and sugar. The pigments were examined spectrographically. Apart from the relatively large pigmentcontent of the anterior pituitary, the lipids of the pituitary do not appear to differ radically from those of other tissues. The chief differenceappears to be in the degree of unsaturation and in the variety of phospho- and glycolipide.

A comparative study of the seminal andvegetative reproductions in certain permanent pasture plants was made under different conditions of pasture management, and different sward types,through direct and indirect methods. By direct observation, we grouped in two categories, chosen young plants originating immediately, either fromseeds, or from vegetative devices. Eleven pasture plants, weedy in nature, were thus observed. Indirectly, the oomparative importance of seminalreproduction was studied from the correlations worked out between the surface vegetation and the top-soil viable seed content. These correlationswere calculated between species of a habitat, or within a species tn various environments.

Although it is possible to extract the lignin atlower temperatures, reflux is necessary to bring about the extraction within a reasonable length of time. The lignin was always isolated incombination with carbohydrate material. The amount of attached carbohydrate, (indicated by the lowering of methoxyl content), was a function ofthe moisture content of the woodmeal, decreasing with increase in moisture, due to hydrolysis. The yield of carbohydrate- and acetyl-free ligninwas about 16$ of the weight of the wood [...] A satisfactory method was developed for separation of the crude acetic lignin into four fractions;namely, ether, benzene, methanol and chloroform soluble. The ether and benzene fractions were practically carbohydrate-free while the methanol andchloroform fractions contained the carbohydrate-lignin complex.</description><creator>Bell, Alan.</creator><contributor>Hibbert, H.

Furthermore, when an industrial process is involvedthe importance of deciding as to the relative merits of the results previously obtained is enhanced. In the investigation to be described,particular precautions were taken to insure the validity of the experimental data. This thesis describes an investigation of the equilibrium vaporpressures of the system calcium oxide - sulphur dioxide - water* It thus forms a part of a general investigation into the physical propertiesof sulphite systems which has been in progress in this laboratory lor several years. Two lines or thought were the genesis of these researches;one concerned itself with the purely theoretical phase of the problem, while the other was an expression of the practical and hence commercialaspect, evolving from the fact that certain parts of the system under discussion are identical with the liquors employed in the sulphite cooking wood.</description><creator>Beazley, Warren Benson.</creator><contributor>Maass, O.

I have giventheir comments on everyday routine, on striking events and on their O'Vll friends and acquaintances, so that they may reveal their ownpersonalities and experiences. In their comments the accent of the eighteenth century is heard plainly, and through these letters we are givenan opportunity of meeting the people of a past age. The three ladies may speak in different tones, uut it blends into,one striking picture.Mrs.Montagu is the best observer of political events. Even as a young girl she shovve.d her aptitude for writing news letters, and as a maturematron, living in London, she made an excellent reporter. Her interest in her husband's business sharpened her powers of observation to a morethan feminine acuteness. Mrs. Thrale does not show as much interest in this aspect of her 'world: she does not mention politics as often in herletters, and her references do not have such detailed information or show such command of the subject. Fanny Burney is the poorest politicalreporter of all. Politics did not often appeal to her imagination; she seldom mentions finy public events unless they affected those dear to her.Mrs Montagu' s letters show the state of public feeling in London on many of the most important questions of the day.

A consideration of thedomestic scene and long-term views have been signally lacking. If anything is being pointed out, it is that not just an adjustment of thebalance-of-payments is desired, but one that is accomplished without strain or hindrance on economic prosperity and progress. The story of thebalance-of-payments shows that in the early period a heavy foreign debt was piled up. It was assumed that the automatic functioning of theeconomic system would enable this to be borne without strain, (or the matter was neglected altogether). Such has not been the case. Thefluctuating nature of the Canadian economy and the vulnerability of the Canadian export trade to external price and market disturbancesmake this debt and its service charges singularly burdensome. Flexibility and easy adjustment are prime objectives in balance-of paymentsoperations. Obviously, a simple solution cannot be expected. A planning authority can hope to mitigate this by seeking to introduce a measureof stability and internal economic adjustment.</description><creator>Winkler, Louis.</creator><contributor>Marsh, L.

Adsorption of nitrogen by silica and nickelhas been detected. The ethylene-silica system has been investigated at pressures up to one atmospnere and at temperatures between 24° and 296°.Adsorption is of the van der Waale' type only. A value for the heat of adsorption has been calculated. The ethylene-nickel system has beeninvestigated at pressures up to one atmosphere and at temperatures between -82° and 250°. In the lower temperature range adsorption is principallyof the van der Waals 1 type. In addition a slow adsorption occurs, the rate of which increases with increase in temperature. After a periodof ten hours the pseudo-equilibrium values 0 for isobaric adsorption are a minimum at about 21 and then 0 increase rapidly to values at 142which are considerably greater than at -82°.

Its oonnection with the recognition of individual differencesand the advance in their measurement by modern psychological methods has been shown. A survey of the functional divisions of student personne1 workhas be made. The place of this work in the university activities has been examined. The idea of coordinating and supplementing the existingagencies into a personnel system is thought to be better than that of organizing the personnel department as a separate unit, coordinationrather than centralization, so that the whole institution may become active in carrying on the personnel work.Four types of psychological neasurements; general inte11igenoe tests, achievement tests, personality tests, and aptitude tests have beendescribed and examined.

The mechanism is, in the main, the same as with the lower members of the series.The reaction is, however, complicated by the formation of condensation products and the results are therefore less accurate than thoseobtained for lower members of the series. The activation energy is approximately the same as those of the other nitrites. The velocity constantat lb9.9°C is 8.19 10"4see_1 as compared with .97 for methyl, 1.89 for ethyl, and 3.95 for n-propyl nitrite. The results are discussed inthe light of unimolecular theory, both of Kassel's treatment and the more absolute treatment of Eyring and Rice and Gershinowitz.It is concluded that the main factor contributing to the increase in the high pressure rate with molecular complexity is the progressive diminutionin binding energy as the homologous series is ascended.

In the normal species the phenotype is conditioned bya balance between the speltoid determiners and the counteracting inhibitors. The latter are borne on the major arm of the C-chromosome,the former elsewhere in the complement. On the one hand, a deficiency for these inhibitors upsets the balance and allows development toproceed in the speltoid direction; on the other, a reduplication modifies development so that the compactoid phenotype is manifested.The extreme mutant types resemble superficially the species T. spelta and £. cormoacturn respectively. Both the deficiencies andthe reduplications may involve either toe whole or simply a part of the C-chromosome. [...]</description><creator>Smith, Stanley George</creator><contributor>Huskins, C.

While the organic structure of cellulose is important, this physico-chemical investigation deals with the physical structure of cellulose and the influence of water upon it. When it is considered how much of the nature of cellulose is bound up in its fibrous structure, its tensile strength, and the swelling behavior that it exhibits, it is seen how inadequate are formulae which explain only its chemical reactions and leave its physical properties untouched untouched. From an academic standpoint the interest is that concerned with the properties of a swelling gel that is, with the chemistry and physics of surfaces involving the interplay of surface forces, cohesion, of structural units, adhesion to foreign materials, adsorption, swelling, and the  like.[...]</description><creator>Shipley, John Harvard</creator><contributor>Maass, O.(Supervisor)</contributor><date>1939</date><subject>Cellulose</subject><title>The Heat content of water sorbed on cellulose.</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rx913s794.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1v53k1081</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:tb09j8404</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T17:10:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The present investigation deals with the microscopic changes which occur in the pancreatic gland of the cat, when this animal issubjected to parasympathetic and sympathetic stimulation.

Hence a deal of space is devoted to outliningthe development from early humanist paedagogy of the ideals of educational dramatics. This part of the work I have hadto restrict more or less to the English field, but within its limits it is, I believe, sufficiently comprehensive.Moreover, so far as I can ascertain, it has never hitherto been attempted. The remainder of the Thesis is concernedwith the dramatists who wrote for academic production. The intention here was, in the main, to trace the influenceof educational dramatics upon the professional theatre of the late 16th and early 17th centuries.
