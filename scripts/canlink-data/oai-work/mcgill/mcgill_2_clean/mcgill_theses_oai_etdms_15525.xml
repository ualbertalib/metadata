Vestibular tests were performed on 19 normal adults which made up the control group. 9 Seizure Patients with temporal lobe lesions were also tested. It is thought that lesions of the temporal lobe may produce directional preponderance of nystagmus to calorie stimulation on the ipsilateral side. This means that the homolateral labyrinth is more sensitive to hot water and the contralateral labyrinth to cold water stimulation. In the control series of 19 cases, 63 percent showed directional preponderance in more than two parameters; the parameters used being: total time, latent period, total beats, total amplitude and maximum slow speed. In the 9 temporal lobe cases tested, 5 showed directional preponderance in more than two parameters.</description><creator>Wong, John.</creator><contributor>Gannon, R.

It is a result of intermolecular attractive forces of the solid and the substance adsorbed. The attractive forces are different for each system. This variation of attractive forces causes an increased concentration of one molecular type on the solid surface when two different molecules are brought into contact with the solid. The process is reversible. In the chemical engineering sense, adsorption may be defined in terms of a unit operation which deals with the utilization of surface forces and the concentration of materials on the surfaces of solid bodies referred to as adsorbants.</description><creator>Wong, Sau.

A freezing apparatus was designed and constructed to conduct laboratory freezing tests on Arctic soils. The experimental observations did not agree with predictions based on the currently used grain-size criterion. A new frost-susceptibility concept was introduced end a method of evaluating relative frost-susceptibility was proposed. Predicted values were successfully compared with observed frost effects. The relative importance of external conditions was discussed for the particular case of rapid freezing. Laboratory observations were applied with success to the prediction of frost penetration for Lake Hazen conditions.</description><creator>Windisch, Stephen. J.</creator><contributor>McCutcheon, J.

However, the locus of "commonness” cannot be resolved by such techniques. In-vitro studies reported in this communication permit the application of Michaelis-Menten formulation to the kinetics of transport of these compounds in rat kidney cortex slices. The data indicate that L-proline, hydroxy-L-proline and glycine cannot be transported by identical mechanisms but that there is some aspect of these systems which is common. The order of affinity for transport in-vitro is proline &gt; hydroxyproline &gt; glycine, confirming in-vivo observations. The relation of these findings to the control of imino acid and glycine transport under certain genetic and maturational conditions in man, is discussed. A proposal as to the locus of commonness in transport generally, and more specifically in the transport of glycine and the imino acids, is discussed.</description><creator>Wilson, Onslow.

The suggestion that this might be the case arose from the fact that ethanolamine replaces the vitamin in the nutrition of excised tomato roots grown in sterile culture (Boll, 1954). Analytical data presented by Boll (1959) were interpreted to mean that ethanolamine is not a precursor of vitamin B6 in the excised tomato root. However, it became necessary to reexamine this question because of some recent work by Morris and Woods (1959), who reported that glycoladehyde (GA) gave good replacement for the vitamin in the nutrition of a vitamin B6 requiring mutant of Escherichia coli. According to several authors (Fruton and Simmonds, 1958), ethanolamine is converted to GA metabolically.</description><creator>Willemot, Claude.</creator><contributor>Boll, W.

If we take the flat race as the model, held at one place on one date, then it was not a difficult task to see that the first person who passed a given point was declared the winner. When too many entries precluded the running of the race at one time and at one place, then beats became necessary. At first only winners of beats went forward into the finals but because, in psychological terms, it would be too time consuming to get paired comparisons with every possible comparison being used, heats are run with the proviso that there must be some device for including people who, although they had lost their own heat, could, had they been placed in another beat, have possibly been winners. </description><creator>Widdop, James.

Jaundice results from a breakdown in either uptake, conjugation or excretion or bilirubin by the liver, and the origin or the symptom can usually be determined by the type of pigment present in the serum. About 50% of all newborn infants exhibit some degree of jaundice, which seldom exceeds 10 mg% and is maximal between the third and fourth days of life. This is generally referred to as “icterus neonatorum” or physiological jaundice. Superimposed on this "icterus neonatorum” are the more severe cases of jaundice for which there is a known cause. These include blood group incompatability between mother and child (erythroblastosis fetalis), septicemia, hepatitis and congenital obliteration of the bile duct.</description><creator>Whittaker, Hyacinth.

What can be stated confidently, however, is that the circuitry which is the indispensable anatomical basis of vision does run in these tracts. Similarly, the occurrence of unconsciousness subsequent to a local lesion in the brain does not prove that consciousness resides in that area to the exclusion of any other area, but only that the integrity of the damaged region is essential to consciousness. An analysis of the anatomy of lesions which produce short, prolonged or permanent loss of consciousness is helpful in deciding which areas are reversibly and paroxysmally inactivated in petit mal epilepsy.</description><creator>Weir, Bryce.

Today, the increased educational opportunities extended to the children of all social and economic classes, through compulsory public schooling and scholarship programs, have widened the scope of career choice immeasurably. Undoubtedly, this trend towards equal opportunities is a good thing; however, it contributes towards making the selection of a realistic educational program, and the choice of an ultimate career, a more difficult task. Moreover, as higher learning comes within the means of children of all classes, post-secondary school training institutions become more crowded, entrance standards rise, and students are forced to make vocational choices at a comparatively early age, in order that they may channel their efforts towards competing successfully to enter the advanced schools of their choice.</description><creator>Weary, William.

Practically all of contemporary mathematical evolution theory is encompassed by the field of population genetics, which takes the empirical facts of Mendelian genetics as given and infers their evolutionary consequences. The writer has approached the subject from the opposite direction. This thesis takes the occurrence of evolution by natural selection as a given fact, and emphasizes that mere chance could not have produced the highly adapted organisms we see around us within the limitations of time and space to which natural selection has been restricted. It then attempts to infer the properties of a genetic system, and other conditions, which are necessary and sufficient to allow natural selection to have yielded products so different from those which would have been yielded by chance alone.</description><creator>Warburton, Frederick.

For many years after Hammett introduced it the concept of the acidity function, Ho, as an unique extension of the pH scale to concentrated acid solutions remained a useful and satisfactory way of treating strong acidic systems. However, evidence has accumulated from recent work to indicate that a single scale probably does not exist even for indicator bases of fairly similar structure. This is corroborated by the present work in which the basic strengths of carbonyl and thiocarbonyl compounds such as acids, amides, and thioureas have been determined spectrophotometically.</description><creator>Wang, I.

He appears in the earliest stages of Arthurian tradition, which long preceded any written records. He was known on the continent as early as the eleventh century. Moreover, he was celebrated, both on the continent and in England, as the nonpareil or Arthur' a knights. He is connected with Arthur from earliest times, and in the oldest romantic stories of Arthur he is shown as the King's constant companion and favourite.

The values of solute mole fraction in the particles calculated by the Schiessler-Rowe method agreed with those obtained by using the Langmuir-type equation. The Eagle-Scott method was used to calculate the average solute mole fraction in the particle pore volume. In the steady-state column, diffusion in bulk liquid outside the particles and diffusion inside the particles were both present up to Reynolds number of 90. At higher values of Reynolds number, diffusion inside the particles was the only rate-determining factor. In the fixed-bed column, the overall transfer coefficients calculated by using the Schumann method were round to be dependent on particle size and liquid velocity. The values of overall transfer coefficients in the unsteady-state and the steady-state columns agreed within a few percent.</description><creator>Wagle, Dinkar. G.</creator><contributor>Phillips, J.

The literature on the subject is already extensive, these grasslands having attracted the attention of a large number of natural scientists, in particular botanists, geographers and zoologists, yet almost all this work suffers from 'inadequate field data, and an almost total lack of experimental evidence’. {J. S. Beard, 1953; p. 149.)

The first part provides a historical background of the development of the Central Areas. The second part deals with the theory of Central Areas, basically divided into two sections: the first section discusses theories of the structure: land use functions and the forces behind these functions; the second section deals with the form: physical structure and external visual qualities. The main statement is that the form is the result of the structure. This second part will give background to the third part, explaining and complementing it from a theory point of view. The third part is the actual study of the Central Areas of Ottawa, Montreal, Toronto, London and Quebec, recording existing conditions in 1950 and 1962 and describing future plans. The fourth part will discuss the findings.</description><creator>Virak, Victor.</creator><contributor>Spence-Sales, H.

It seeks to explore, by analyzing these experiences, whether the recreation agency can play a role in the prevention and prediction of juvenile delinquency. A sample group of ten delinquents, who had experiences in recreation agencies, were selected from among the residents of the Boys’ Farm and Training School in Shawbridge, Quebec. Records kept at the Boys’ Farm and Training School and interviews with the boys, were the sources of data. In the interviews, questions were designed to get factual information about agency participation, behaviour patterns demonstrated during participation, relationships with staff and other members, attitudes towards the agency and the manner and extent of parent contact with agency. The data was analyzed in light of what has been said in current literature about the causes and prevention of delinquency. The final chapter concludes that the recreation and informal education agency does have the potential for contributing to the prevention and prediction of juvenile delinquency, It offers suggestions for adaptations and additions in their service if they are to realize this potential. Furthermore, areas for future research are indicated.</description><creator>Vine, Goldie. S.</creator><contributor>Gifford, C.

Several genetic theories have been suggested to explain the observed field characteristics, but none have been completely accepted by authorities on the subject. Theories on the origin of anorthosite may be classed as magnetic, metasomatic, and anatectic, and all contain useful ideas. Where an aspect of the problem appears to be successfully solved by one genetic theory, another remains embarrassingly unexplained. It is quite possible that a complex series of events is responsible for the formation of the anorthosites and their associated rock types. Kranck (1961) points out that, "The origin of the anorthosites is almost as controversial a subject as the granite problem.”</description><creator>Vincent, John. S.</creator><contributor>Kranck, E.

Next there follows an analysis of the problems of civil aviation in Europe, emphasizing the need for closer co-operation between both governments and airlines, and of the various forms of collaboration and co-ordination between airlines. Mention is also made of a number of governmental and private efforts to facilitate civil air transport and to stimulate its development, i.a. of the plans submitted by Bonnefous, Sforza and Van de Kieft to the Council of Europe and the establishment of the European Civil Aviation Conference at Strasbourg in 1955 as a result of these plans.</description><creator>Verploeg, Elias.

The task of these pages is to analyze his teachings and doctrines, to assess his contributions to economies, and to determine how his approach to economies differed from that of his great western contemporaries. Few economists have been as prolific as Sombart. He wrote many books and treatises and innumerable journal articles. This work, which culminated in his description of the economies of societies in all epochs from the Carolingians to his own, must be added to many compilations of a statistical kind. The total is enormous. It represents an amount of work and research seldom found in the lifetime of one man.</description><creator>Varsanyi, Nicholas. A.</creator><contributor>Weldon, J.

The walls of most fungi studied up to the present time have contained either chitin or cellulose. In one case, the wall contained both chitin and cellulose (Fuller and Barshad, 1960). Staining tests with the wall of Amoebidium parasiticum failed to reveal the presence of either chitin or cellulose (Schenk, 1858; Whisler, 1961).

In order to prove this contention empirically, several experiments have been performed on a variety of voluntary responses, such as, verbal, perceptual, conceptual and judgmental. However, a critical survey of these studies, such as that reported in the following pages, reveals that they have failed to demonstrate convincingly any more than superficial similarities between their results and the results reported in conditioning experiments. Furthermore, their authors have typically shown such strong predilection for working within the framework of traditional formulations of SG that they have failed to analyze and report their results in such a way as to bring out their full significance for other areas of psychological investigation to which they are relevant.</description><creator>Tripathi, Lal.
