To begin with, after six decades of stringent regulation and control, the State finally realized that international trends and domestic needs dictated a drastic reduction in the role it played in the economic affairs of its airlines. Airline deregulation thus became a reality in Canada and as such, a detailed review of the process leading to the adoption of the National Transportation Act, 1987, as well as an extensive legal analysis of the legislation itself are warranted. The second major development was the extremely rapid process of consolidation, precipitated mainly by deregulation, into an industry dominated by two airlines; a duopoly. The implications arising from this situation for present and future competition in the Canadian air transport industry, as viewed from a market contestability perspective, need to be assessed.</description><creator>Petsikas, George</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Economics, Commerce-Business.</subject><subject>Political Science, Public Administration.</subject><subject>Transportation.</subject><title>Airline deregulation and competition in the Canadian air transport industry today, and prospects for the future</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rx913r054.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/79407z44b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3r074w32x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:56:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A pultrusion process using staggered cylindrical pins in a molten polymer reservoir is one method of pre-compounding long glass fibre-reinforced thermoplastic materials. This material, if well impregnated with resin, will maintain much of its aspect ratio during subsequent moulding. The longer fiber length translates into improved mechanical properties versus conventional extrusion compounded material. This research studies the effect of a novel pin shape and configuration on the wetting of glass roving during thermoplastic pultrusion compounding. Experimental pultrusion studies using polypropylene indicate that alternating concave (collecting) and convex (spreading) contoured pins promote superior resin impregnation compared to conventional cylindrically shaped pins. A mathematical model describes the necessary convex pin contour and was used to fabricate the convex pins employed in the research. Pins thus designed promote uniform filament spreading across the wide convex contour which in turn favours good resin impregnation.</description><creator>Bates, Philip J.</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Plastics Technology.</subject><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Improving long-fibre compounding via a novel thermoplastic pultrusion process</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xw42n9180.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3r074w32x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cf95jc61n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:56:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We divided 640 consecutively live-born newborns into two overlapping groups: a traditional very low birthweight (BW) cohort (500-1500 g, mean BW 1055 g) and a gestational age (GA) cohort (23-30 weeks, mean BW 1070 g). We showed: (1) An illusory protective effect of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) for in-hospital mortality in the 500-1500 cohort: odds ratio (OR), 0.55. In the 23-30 cohort the crude OR was 1.19; adjusting for differences in GA between IUGR and non-IUGR infants resulted in an odds ratio of 3.15 (95% C.I., 1.57-6.32). (2) Confounding by growth status was demonstrated in a hypothetical observational study of method of delivery and in-hospital mortality. Although this confounding was present in both cohorts, it was larger in the 500-1500 cohort (1.9 vs. 1.1 weeks difference in GA between cesarean and vaginally delivered infants after adjusting for differences in BW).

EPTC$ sp+$ applied prior to crop seeding in 1984 significantly reduced yellow nutsedge shoot growth in the first year but did not significantly reduce tuber populations. EPTC$ sp+$ significantly improved corn silage and grain yield and alfalfa establishment in the first year but did not significantly improve red clover establishment. In the second year, a trend of superior forage legume establishment and lower yellow nutsedge shoot production was observed in those treatments established the previous year with EPTC$ sp+$. Over the two year period, yellow nutsedge tuber populations in treatments established with EPTC$ sp+$ were significantly greater in the monocropped corn treatment than in any other treatment. In treatments established without a herbicide, yellow nutsedge tuber populations were also greatest in the monocropped corn treatment.</description><creator>Armour, Ian</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Red clover.</subject><subject>Chufa -- Cultural control.</subject><subject>Corn.</subject><subject>Companion planting.</subject><subject>Alfalfa.</subject><title>Intercropping corn (Zea mays L.) with forage legumes to suppress yellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus L.)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tq57ns21j.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2b88qd322</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Plant Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hq37vp761</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:56:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Indium Phosphide epitactic layers grown by MOCVD and lightly doped with Zn and Mg (p-type) have been studied by Hall effect measurements and secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS). The Zn-doped samples showed a uniform distribution of the acceptor concentration as a function of depth. Mg doped samples showed strong Mg concentration gradients, with substantial diffusion into the substrate. An electrical transport model has been developed for each of the previous cases. These models provided excellent agreement with experiment. The uniformly Zn-doped samples have been used for a detailed study of hopping conduction. Excellent quantitative agreement can be reached between theory and experiment both in the variable range hopping regime and in the nearest neighbor hopping regime. The saturation of the latter regime has been observed, and a model has been found in qualitative agreement with it. An interpretation of the low temperature data on the basis of the presence of a Coulomb gap in the impurity band density of states is not appropriate.</description><creator>Belache, Boukhalfa</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Physics, Electricity and Magnetism.</subject><title>Propriétés électriques de l'InP in type p</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pr76f468g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hq37vp761</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6q182m40w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:56:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The corresponding isoperoxidases from the flax genotrophs L and S have different molecular weights.

Its longest reading frame sequence is divergent from those of other peroxidases, but contains some related segments.

Within a range of densities of infective larvae (500-6000/cage), randomly spread on damp peat moss, a linear increase was observed in the mean number of fourth stage larvae embedded in the intestinal mucosa per host. As host density increased (1-6 mice/cage), but exposure dose held constant (8000L$ sb3$), the mean number of L$ sb4$ recovered per mouse decreased at a faster rate than expected assuming a constant per capita rate of transmission. In an attempt to interpret the experimental data, mathematical models were generated. Although the inclusion of a death rate of infective larvae dependent on mouse density did improve the fit of the mathematical model based on a constant per capita rate of transmission, the best fit was provided by a model assuming a per capita rate of transmission dependent on mouse density. An independent experiment exploring the impact of surface area available for transmission on the relationship between host density and the rate of infection confirmed the adequacy of the mouse density-dependent per capita rate of transmission hypothesis.</description><creator>Gascon, Lise Hélène</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Heligmosomatidae.</subject><subject>Mice -- Parasites.</subject><title>Transmission of Heligmosomoides polygyrus (Nematoda) to laboratory mice : effects of larval and host density</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v692t7576.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7p88ch864</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Parasitology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:m613mz76s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:56:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Four meat spoilage organisms were grown at 4$ sp circ$C for 7 d, in an aqueous extract of meat (Meat Juice Medium), and the levels of various nutrients in the extracts were measured.

For optimum soil management, however, we must be able to evaluate adequately soil structural damages. This study compares different methods of assessing soil structure as affected by compaction and subsoiling treatments in a clay soil under corn production. The tests used were: total porosity as calculated from densimeter readings and from soil cores; structural porosity; water desorption characteristics; and soil profile examination. These tests were performed in three layers of 20 cm and evaluation was based on their practicality and their ability to differentiate between treatments and to correlate with corn yield. The results confirm that total porosity is a poor indicator of compaction in the subsoil. In soil profile assessments, ped descriptions were preferable to examination of pores. Water content and saturation deficit at $-$4.0 and $-$100 kPa were the best indicators of treatments and plant response.</description><creator>Duval, Jean</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Clay soils.</subject><subject>Soil structure.</subject><subject>Soil porosity.</subject><subject>Corn -- Soils.</subject><title>Assessing porosity characteristics as indicators of compaction in a clay soil</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sx61dn60v.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g445cf49w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Renewable Resources</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xk81jm63t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:56:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Conditional sampling techniques were used to analyze airbourne carbon dioxide and water vapour flux traces recorded during the FIFE experiment.

The second method, based on quadrant analysis, permitted the distinction of physical structures which are thought to represent the signatures of turbulent flux structures such as eddies or thermals.

Department chairs spend 22 hours each week performing their different administrative roles but would like to increase the time to 25,4 hours per week in order to do a better job. Women chairs spend 23 hours and would like to spend more time working on the administrative roles of department chair than their male counterparts. This is also true of the professional sector in relation to the general sector. The importance attached to the different administrative roles and the perception of these roles vary depending on whether the chair is a man or a woman, in the general or professional sector. Department chairs have intrapersonal role conflicts. They are caught between what they do and what they would like to do to make their department function well. Though there are definite role conflicts, there are no significant ambiguities in the job.</description><creator>Robert, Guy, 1908-</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Fédération des cégeps -- Administration</subject><title>Le rôle de la coordonnatrice et du coordonnateur de département d'enseignement dans les collèges d'enseignement général et professionnel (cégeps) francophones publics du Québec /</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xs55md13c.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wm117q12q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xg94hq90g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:56:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Enclosed spaces dominate Anne Hebert's imaginary world. The house is usually depicted as a prison and a tomb, and only sometimes as a shelter. Products of a stagnant society whose laws they wish to perpetuate, parents give their children a loveless upbringing, in a house from which nature and the external world are rigorously excluded. A few of these captives think that happiness is to be found in marriage, but the conjugal home and that in which adultery occurs prove scarcely more welcoming. Some houses can even be dangerous. The house almost always appears as a forerunner of the tomb, inhabited by individuals unwilling to outgrow childhood, by the living dead, by the living who await death. Certain of Hebert's characters, however, revolt against this fate and flee the closed house. In order to be free, the Hebertian hero must exorcise the past and dissolve the obsessive image of the closed house. The rare open habitations of Hebert's universe are shelters to be found along the individual's road to liberation and life. Most are located near the sea or in the countryside, in a magnificent natural setting evocative of Paradise lost.</description><creator>Robinson, Christine, 1962-</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Hébert, Anne -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><title>La maison dans les romans et les nouvelles d'Anne Hébert /</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nz806101x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94hq90g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1j92g866h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:56:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The orientation and survival of neonate snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) were studied in 1986 and 1987. Orientation mechanisms were tested in an outdoor parabolic arena. These experiments suggested that positive geotaxis was a dominant cue directing neonate snapping turtles to water. Hatchling survival and movement from nest to water were studied in Calumet, Quebec using isotope tagging. A highly significant number of hatchlings (95%) released on sloped nest sites were positively geotactic. Hatchlings released on level ground moved in random directions. Eighty-two percent of hatchlings from nests within 18 m of the shoreline were successful in reaching water. Incidence of mortality was greatest for hatchlings from nests between 121 and 165 m from water. Mortality resulted from vehicles and predation by bullfrogs (Rana catesbieana) and meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus). Female carapace length was positively correlated with clutch size and mean egg diameter. Egg diameters were positively correlated with hatchling weights. Clutch sizes of nests more than 100 m from water were larger than those closer to water.</description><creator>Robinson, Candace</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Turtles -- Québec (Province)</subject><subject>Chelydra serpentina -- Reproduction.</subject><title>Orientation and survival of hatchlings and reproductive ecology of the common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina) in southern Quebec</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gh93h073z.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1j92g866h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Renewable Resources</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8k71nj30m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:56:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The capability of radar measured rainfall to enhance the simulation of storm hydrographs was assessed. Six rainfall events which occurred in 1986 and 1987 over an 8.13 km$ sp2$ agricultural watershed in south-western Quebec were used in model simulations. Radar measured rainfall rates were calibrated using measurements from a single tipping-bucket raingauge located at the study site. A deterministic, event-based model, HYMO, was used to simulate streamflow using radar and gauge measured rainfall. The model utilized two rainfall abstraction techniques, i.e. the SCS Curve Number method and the Green-Ampt infiltration equation. Simulated streamflow hydrographs were compared with observed storm flows. For short duration, high intensity, simple rainfall events, there were minor improvements in hydrograph simulations when calibrated radar measured rainfalls were input to the model, compared to tipping-bucket raingauge measurements. Complex, low intensity storms were poorly simulated by the model using either rainfall data source. Neither rainfall abstraction method proved consistently superior.</description><creator>Schell, George Stewart.</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Rainfall frequencies -- Québec (Province) -- Saint Dominique.</subject><subject>Runoff -- Québec (Province) -- Saint Dominique.</subject><subject>Hydrologic models.</subject><subject>Radar in hydrology.</subject><title>The application of radar measured rainfall to hydrologic modelling /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3x816n724.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8k71nj30m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Agricultural Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k930bz418</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:56:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><creator>Smith, Janet</creator><date>1981</date><subject>Snow -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><subject>Acid precipitation (Meteorology) -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><subject>Pollution -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><title>Variations in snow quality in the Montreal region</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wp988m18v.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k930bz418</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n296x0163</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:56:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><creator>Al-Shway, Saad F.</creator><date>1982</date><subject>Engineering, General.</subject><title>Ventilatory effects of airflow through the upper airways of newborn kittens and puppies</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c821gm04h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n296x0163</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physiology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kk91fm88x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:56:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><creator>Ma, Kathleen Y.H.</creator><date>1981</date><subject>Engineering, General.</subject><title>Behaviour and migration of Nippostrongylus brasiliensis and Ascaris suum in the tissues of the rat</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f7623d74m.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kk91fm88x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Parasitology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6969z202g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:56:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><creator>Bethune, Drew C.
