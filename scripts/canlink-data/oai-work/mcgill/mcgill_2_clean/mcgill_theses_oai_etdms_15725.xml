The Bellamy triangle method has been used to produce divergence and this divergence is shown to have continuity in the horizontal, the vertical and in time. A discussion of the scale on which this parameter can be analysed objectively and the errors involved are presented.

Many operative procedures have been developed, some of which have been used clinically. However, in contrast to the great advances in other aspects of cardiac surgery, such as congenital heart disease and chronic valvular disease, ischemic heart disease remains in an area in which progress has been slow. At the experimental level, one of the major problems is the assessment of revascularization procedures.(19) Even if some operative procedure can be developed in the experimental animal which is reasonably safe, one is still reluctant to offer this to the patient unless there is sufficient proof that it is likely to be beneficial to him.</description><creator>Dixon, Michael.

The first attempt to determine what meteorological factors could be responsible for these fluctuations was to sort the storms for April and May 1961 into two categories; those predominantly continuous and those predominantly showery precipitation, using both constant altitude radar pictures and hourly precipitation records. There was a slight tendency for the higher tritium concentrations to occur in continuous precipitation. Height/time diagrams showing the positions of the various airmasses over Ottawa revealed that the highest tritium concentrations occurred when maritime arctic air extended from the ground to the tropopause. On occasions with mA air at the ground and other airmasses above it, the measured tritium concentration was approximately proportional to the depth of mA air traversed by the precipitation. The lowest tritium concentration was measured in a storm wholly contained in mT air. Air mass trajectories confirmed that the higher concentrations were measured in precipitation which had fallen through air of arctic origin with an arctic trajectory than through air of tropical origin.</description><creator>De-Heer-Amissah, Adrian.

The principal objective was to determine the mineralogical composition of these shales and to relate variations in mineralogy to changes in the overall geological picture. With a few minor exceptions, no previous work of this type had ever been undertaken within this region. It has been found that differences in shale mineralogy, as determined by X-ray diffraction procedures, could be directly related to variations in tectonic activity of the Canadian Shield and the land mass of Vermontia, the two principal source areas from which the clastic sediments of the St. Lawrence Lowland were derived.</description><creator>Dean, Ronald.

In this thesis I plan to stay very close to the standard, orthodox definition of money. Money will be defined here as any commodity generally used as a means of settling economic obligations. This thesis will focus, therefore, on the means-of-payment function of money with the further stipulation that it must be generally acceptable. What money is in an economy will depend very much on practice, that is, on what people are willing to accept as a means of making settlements. The other functions of money, such as its unit-of-account, store-of-value, and means-of-making-deferred-payments functions will be assumed to be present simply because any means of payment which did not contain these functions would not be generally acceptable for long.</description><creator>De Melto, Dennis.

Paxten and Payne ('48); Morse and Achs (149) and Edlund ('50) have statistically shown that pancreatitis is seen two to three times more often in the female than in the male, while carcinoma of the pancreas is twice as common in males as in females, (Willis, ‘48; Anderson, ‘51). Furthermore, this study will provide a precise account of the basic anatomy of the pancreatic duct pattern. The pancreatic duct system of twenty foetuses, twenty infants and one hundred and forty four adults, was therefore examined by eosin injection, radiological and dissection techniques.</description><creator>Dawson, William.

Recently, yet another type of polymerization process has been discovered independently by several workers. Using the terminology of Roha (1), this may be termed coordination polymerization. According to Roha, this type of polymerization is not regarded as distinctly cationic, anionic, or covalent, but rather as embodying these classical concepts to different degrees, in accordance with the coordinating influence of the catalyst. The four main steps that may operate in vinyl-type polymerization are initiation, propagation, chain transfer, and termination.</description><creator>Dawes, David.

Each organ may be considered the result of selections through perhaps many millions of generations, arriving at its present level of development and specialization primarily by way of natural selection. The mammalian heart is a striking example of an organ which has evolved to do a specific task with a high degree of efficiency. The primary function of the heart is that of pumping fluid nutritive material to the organism. As this enormous task must be performed continuously throughout the life of the organism, it would be expected that such a function would require a highly versatile and specialized organ.</description><creator>Davis, Eldred.

The work culminated in the development, pretest and analysis of an interview schedule. The following variables are incorporated in this schedule: the independent variables are household predicaments inferred from issues in food, clothing, health and occupation; the dependent variable is the householder's ability to cape with predicaments arising from the need to satisfy these requirements in the maintenance of a household. Degrees of predicaments are to be assessed by their effect on role performance (role handicap); effectiveness of coping is similarly identified by the degree of role handicap remaining. The results of the pretest of this schedule on seventeen respondents is discussed, mainly in terms of errors of omission and commission in the construction of the schedule.</description><creator>Costom, Dorothie.</creator><creator>Grande, Gregory.</creator><creator>Masson, William.</creator><creator>Parish, Mary.</creator><creator>Rozental Caryl.</creator><contributor>Moore, J.

The effect of this glaciation was two-fold. The growth of the ice sheets led to a depression of the earth’s crust beneath the glaciated areas and to also resulted in a world-wide lowering of sea level, while the disappearance of the continental ice sheets resulted in an eustatic rise of sea level and an isostatic uplift of the depressed land areas. Flint estimates that the eustatic lowering of sea level during the last glacial maximum was approximately 350 feet.</description><creator>Compton, Paul. A.</creator><contributor>Bird, J.

Before commencing a study of the properties and structure of the Poisson distribution, it will be interesting and instructive to examine some of the early literature on the subject. By the year 1914 many writers had independently discovered the probability distribution. However, the name by which it is now known is, properly, that of the initial discoverer.</description><creator>Collis-Bird, Jeremy. J.</creator><contributor>Patil, G.

There has been great controversy in the past few years, as more data about human Listeriosis became available, about the significance of L. monocytogenes in foetal death and in neonatal disease. There have been reports in the literature, naming L. monocytogenes as a cause of a large percentage of repeated abortions in women in certain areas.

Whenever data has been collected for such a purpose, it may be necessary or desirable to subject it to a critical examination to decide whether or not the sample is representative of the population in question so that any conclusions will be valid. The results of such an inspection may lead one to suspect the consistency of the sample, to feel that certain observations have been subject to abnormal errors of some kind and thus that the data, as it stands, does not truly represent the population.

Satisfactory results are obtained at the bottom and top of the ozone layer while, at intermediate heights, the Approximation is not so successful. An explanation of this pattern is obtained by a crude application of criteria suggested by Plass (1960). With routine calculations made feasible by the use of the Approximation, the affect on heating rates of the distribution of ozone and temperature is investigated. The former appears as the more critical of the two parameters. A chart constructed for the graphical determination of flux divergence or heating rate is presented.</description><creator>Clark, John.

For this reason, if for no other, psephology is an important part of political science. Elections have been analyzed in several ways, the researcher's choice of method depending upon his interests and purposes.

By the phrase implication-negation fragment of a propositional logic, we understand the system consisting of all the theses which have implication and/or negation as their sole connectives in the said logic. This means, that we have to find a means to isolate, so to speak, all these theses and then axiomatize the resultant system. Our method of proof is by constructing a Gentzen type Sequenzen Kalkul which is strong enough to embrace all theses in the said logic. Since, Sequenzen Kalkul has a constructive character, every connective, once introduced, will remain in later sequents of the derivation.</description><creator>Chung, Lung-ock.</creator><contributor>McCall, R.
