We recently identified a member of the TGF-beta superfamily of growth factors, activin, as an important regulator of prolactin expression and cell growth. Activin inhibits prolactin expression through inhibition of expression of a pituitary-specific transcription factor, named Pit-1. Pit-1 plays major roles in the development and maintenance of the anterior pituitary gland integrity. In this study, I investigated the intracellular signaling pathways and transcriptional mechanisms by which activin controls Pit-1 activity. I demonstrate that in addition to the down-regulation of mRNA and proteins levels of Pit-1, a functional p38 MAPK signaling pathway is required for activin to down-regulate human Pit-1 gene promoter activity in a Smad-independent manner. This study allows a better understanding of the regulatory effects of activin in the pituitary gland.</description><creator>De Guise, Chantal.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Regulation of Pit-1 gene expression by activin in pituitary cells</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vq27zs109.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0z709136s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kp78gm07v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:17:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The aim of the first project was to evaluate the ability of selected molecules to affect the secondary structure of Abeta(1-42). Such activity is desirable as it may provide new tools to study the role of the Abeta(1-42) conformers in Alzheimer disease. Although this study did not identify molecules able to modulate the conformation of Abeta (1-42), the reported studies have set the fundamental techniques for this project. The goal of the second project was to compare the kavalactone content and the inhibition of human P450 enzymes for commercial and traditional kava extracts. We report that amounts and ratios of kavalactones are similar for solvents that mimic commercial extracts but different from aqueous extract (traditional extract). All extracts tested show similar inhibition of the P450 enzymes suggesting that kava extracts, commercial or traditional, may lead to herb-drug interactions. These results also suggest that because of their higher concentration of kavalactones, commercial kava extracts are more likely to cause adverse drug reactions via inhibition of drug metabolism.</description><creator>Côté, Cynthia S.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><title>Screening of selected molecules for their effect on the secondary structure of amyloid beta.

However, the successful application of collagen gels requires a greater understanding of the relationship between their microstructure and physical-mechanical properties. Therefore, a precise method to modulate collagen gel microstructure in order to attain optimal scaffold properties for diverse biomedical applications is necessary. This dissertation describes a new approach to produce collagen gels with defined microstructures, quantified by hydraulic permeability ( k), in order to optimize scaffold properties for TE applications. It was hypothesized that the measurement of k can be used to study the role of microstructure in collagen gel properties, as well as cell function and cell-scaffold interactions. Applying increasing levels of plastic compression (PC) to the highly hydrated collagen gels resulted in an increase in collagen fibrillar density, reduced Happel model derived k values, increased gel stiffness, promoted MSC metabolic activity, osteogenic differentiation, and mineral deposition, while cell-induced gel contraction diminished. Thus, collagen gels with lower k and higher stiffness values exhibited greater potential for bone tissue engineering. Correlating between collagen gel microstructure, k, and fibroblast function within collagen gels indicated that increasing the level of PC yielded a reduction in pore size and an increase in fibril bundle diameter. Decrease in k values resulted in a decrease in gel contraction and an increase in cell metabolic activity. An increase in cell density accelerated contraction. Therefore, fibroblast function within collagen gels can be optimised by a balance between the microstructure, k, and cell seeding density. Developing a micromechanical model to measure experimental k of collagen gels during confined compression revealed the formation of a dense collagen lamella at the fluid expulsion boundary, thereby generating a two-layer model. By applying gel mass loss into Darcy's law, experimental k values of the lamella, along with the thickness of lamella (c) and hydrated gel layer (b) were measured. An increase in either compression level or compression time resulted in a decrease in k, decrease in b, and an increase in c. In conclusion, controlled compression of collagen gels can be used to produce multi-layered biomimetic scaffolds with defined microstructures and k in order to attain optimal properties for tissue engineering applications.</description><creator>Serpooshan, Vahid</creator><date>2010</date><subject>Engineering, Materials Science.</subject><title>Control of dense collagen gel scaffolds for tissue engineering through measurement and modelling of hydraulic permeability</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5h73q0794.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hh63t056k</identifier><degree><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5138jj16m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:17:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Infection with human T cell Leukemia virus (HTLV-1) can cause Adult T-cell Leukemia (ATL) or the neurological disorder HTLV-1-Associated Myelopathy/Tropical Spastic Paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Although the majority of HTLV-1--infected individuals remain asymptomatic carriers (AC) during their lifetime, 2-5% will develop either ATL or HAM/TSP. The factors that determine HTLV-1 pathogenesis remain elusive, and therefore represent a serious obstacle in the establishment of effective therapies for HTLV-1-associated diseases. Using gene expression profiling of CD4+ T-lymphocytes isolated from HTLV-1-infected individuals, we identified candidate genes differentially regulated in HTLV-1-associated diseases. Of particular interest, SOCS1 was up-regulated in HAM/TSP and AC patients -- but not in ATL. SOCS1 positively correlated with HTLV-1 mRNA in HAM/TSP patient samples. SOCS1-mediated degradation of IRF3 - inhibited antiviral signaling during HTLV-1 infection. Our study reveals a novel evasion mechanism utilized by HTLV-1 which leads to increased retroviral replication, without triggering an IRF3-dependent interferon response. Thus, targeting SOCS1 could represent a potential new approach to enhance the therapeutic potency of IFN-alpha/beta treatment in HAM/TSP disease. Although treatment of hematological malignancies has improved considerably, this has not benefited ATL patients, as they are completely refractory to conventional chemotherapeutic regimens. Oncolytic viruses, such as Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), have emerged as a potential treatment for cancer. Here we show that in vitro VSV infection induced significant oncolysis in highly proliferating primary ATL cells, but not in primary Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) cells which are arrested in the G0 phase. As chronic activation and proliferation is characteristic of ATL cells, we examined the effect of T-cell activation on VSV permissiveness and lysis. Activation of primary CD4+ T-lymphocytes was sufficient to induce VSV replication and VSV-triggered cell death, suggesting that cellular signaling pathways - ERK, JNK or AKT - that promote VSV replication are engaged during T-cell activation. Similarly, mitogenic activation of primary CLL promotes the exit from G0 and entrance into the cell cycle, rendering them susceptible to VSV-mediated oncolysis. Moreover, a global increase in protein translation mediated by the activation of mTOR and eIF4E was crucial for VSV replication in primary lymphocytes. These findings provide novel molecular targets for ATL and CLL therapeutics.</description><creator>Oliere, Stéphanie</creator><date>2010</date><subject>Biology, Virology.</subject><title>Modulation of the innate immune response during human T-cell leukemia virus infection implications for development of an oncolytic virotherapy for ATL</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wp988p62t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5138jj16m</identifier><degree><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h128nj40f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:17:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>It has been hypothesized that head-unrestrained gaze shifts are controlled by an error signal produced by a feedback loop. It has also been hypothesized that the superior colliculus (SC) is within this feedback loop. If the feedback-to-SC hypothesis is valid, an unexpected mid-flight perturbation in gaze trajectory should be quickly followed by a concurrent change in the discharges of collicular saccade-related neurons. To verify this prediction experimentally, primate head movements were unexpectedly and briefly halted during head-unrestrained gaze shifts in the dark. Perturbed gaze shifts were composed of first a gaze saccade made when the head was immobilized by the head-brake, followed by a period where gaze was immobile, called a gaze plateau. The latter was composed of an initial period when the eyes and head were immobile, followed by a period wherein the head was released and the eyes counter-rotated to stabilize gaze. The plateau ended with a corrective gaze saccade to the goal location. In perturbed gaze shifts, there was widely distributed activity on the SC map during gaze plateaus, and there was no evidence that the initial motor program was aborted; the corrective gaze saccades were not "fresh" small stand-alone movements. Cells on the SC map responded at short latencies to head accelerations and associated gaze shift perturbations and carried a gaze position error (GPE = final - instantaneous gaze position) signal. As a large gaze shift progressed there was a caudo-rostral moving hill of activity on the SC map that encoded, not instantaneous veridical GPE, but a filtered version of it (time constant 100ms). Recordings from both the motor map and the so-called "fixation zone" in the rostral SC during perturbed head-unrestrained gaze shifts reveal gaze feedback control and a gaze feedback signal to the SC. However, these results do not prove that the SC is within the online gaze feedback loop, only that such a loop exists and that the collicular map is informed about its calculations.</description><creator>Choi, Woo Young.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Action Potentials -- physiology.</subject><subject>Macaca mulatta.</subject><subject>Superior Colliculi -- physiology</subject><subject>Saccades -- physiology.</subject><subject>Fixation, Ocular -- physiology.</subject><subject>Head Movements -- physiology.</subject><title>Activity pattern on the map of the monkey superior colliculus during head-unrestrained and head-perturbed gaze shifts</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n296x285x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h128nj40f</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:47429f08r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:17:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Human Immunodeficiency Virus type I genome consists of two identical RNA molecules that are non-covalently linked to form a dimer. HIV-1 immature and mature genomic RNA (gRNA) dimers were found in protease defective (PR -) and wild type virions, respectively, and the 5'untranslated region (5' UTR) was shown to play key roles during the genome dimerization process; but the dimerization mechanism still remains to be clarified My research project is to characterize the dimerization process and the role of 5' UTR in genome dimerization in virions produced by tissue culture cells. I'll firstly show the dimer maturation processes of HIV-1 gRNA isolated from newly released to grown-up (≥10h old) wild type, PR-, and SL1 defective (DeltaIDS) virions respectively. The results showed that HIV-1 gRNA dimer maturation process was protease-dependent and involved multiple steps: from low to high dimerization level and dimer thermostability, and from low dimer mobility to intermediate and high mobility. PR- virions did not freeze gRNA conformation in the primordial nascent state and gRNA changed from monomeric in newly released virions to half dimeric in grown-up virions, which showed that genome was packaged in the form of monomeric RNA or fragile dimers, more thermolabile than immature dimers in grown-up PR- virions. DeltaDIS inhibited gRNA dimerization by about 50% in newly released virions, though grown-up DeltaDIS gRNA was fully dimeric, which indicated that the DIS played the initiation role in gRNA dimerization in HIV-1 virions. The gRNA dimerization rate in PR- or DeltaDIS virions was much slower than that in wild type virions. These results show for the first time the whole process of dimer maturation after virion release, the gRNA conformation rearrangement in PR- virions, and the initiation role of the DIS in HIV-1 virions. Next, I'll provide a rather systematic search for the contribution of different regions in 5' UTR to HIV-1 gRNA dimerization by studying selected mutations singly or together with defective SL1. The results showed that the 5'trans-activation response element (5'TAR) was directly involved in gRNA dimerization, and a long distance base-pairing interaction between a sequence in U5 region (nts105-1l5) and another around the initiation codon of the gag gene (nts334-344) was structurally contributive to gRNA dimerization. Deletions of sequences around the 3'end of Primer Binding Site (PBS) stem-loop moderately decreased gRNA dimerization level. Other sequences in 5' UTR except DIS/SL1, which was previously known to play important roles, didn't show any systematic role. Here the results suggested that the absence of inhibition on gRNA dimerization level with defective DIS might be the compensation of the direct role of 5'TAR; and wild type-like dimerization level of DeltaTAR must be the direct contribution of the DIS.</description><creator>Song, Rujun.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>RNA, Viral -- genetics.</subject><subject>5' Untranslated Regions -- genetics.</subject><subject>Dimerization.</subject><subject>Genome, Viral.</subject><subject>HIV-1 -- genetics.</subject><title>Dimerization of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 genome : dimer maturation process and role of the 5' untranslated region in dimerization</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ww72bg319.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/47429f08r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5425kf37m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:17:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Many epidemiological studies assess the effects of time-dependent exposures, where both the exposure status and its intensity vary over time. The analysis of such studies poses the challenge of modelling the association between complex time-dependent drug exposure and the risk, especially given the uncertainty about the etiological relevance of doses taken in different time periods. To address this challenge, I developed a flexible method for modelling cumulative effects of time-varying exposures, weighted by recency, represented by time-dependent covariates in the Cox proportional hazards model. The function that assigns weights to doses taken in the past is estimated using cubic regression splines. Models with different number of knots and constraints are estimated. Bootstrap techniques are used to obtain pointwise confidence bands around the weight functions, accounting for both the sampling variation of the regression coefficients, and the uncertainty at the model selection stage, i.e. the additional variance due to a posteriori selection of the number of knots. To assess the method in simulations, I had to develop and validate a novel algorithm to generate event times conditional on time-dependent covariates and compared it with the algorithms available in the literature. The proposed algorithm extends a previously proposed permutational algorithm to include a rejection sampler. While all the algorithms generated data sets that, once analyzed, provided virtually unbiased estimates with comparable variances, the algorithm that I proposed reduced the computational time by more than 50 per cent relative to alternative methods. I used simulations to systematically investigate the properties of the weighted cumulative dose method. Six different weight functions were considered. Simulations showed that in most situations, the proposed method was able to capture the shape of the true weight functions and to produce estimates of the magnitude of the exposure effect on the risk that were close to those used to generate the data. I finally illustrated the use of the weighted cumulative dose modelling by reassessing the association between the use of selected benzodiazepines and fall-related injuries, using administrative data on a cohort of elderly who initiated their use of benzodiazepines between 1990 and 2004.</description><creator>Sylvestre, Marie-Pierre.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Pharmacoepidemiology -- statistics &amp; numerical data.</subject><subject>Proportional Hazards Models.</subject><subject>Risk Assessment -- methods.</subject><subject>Benzodiazepines -- adverse effects.</subject><subject>Accidental Falls -- statistics &amp; numerical data.</subject><subject>Prescription Drugs -- adverse effects</subject><subject>Time Factors.</subject><title>Flexible modelling for the cumulative effects of time-varying exposure, weighted by recency, on the hazard</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128nj41q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5425kf37m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3t945v55v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:17:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating motor neuron disease which results from the degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons in the brainstem, spinal cord and motor cortex. Tragically there is no treatment to prevent ALS. The drug Riluzole acts to delay progression, but only by a month or so in this disease that has a survival length of three to five years. The identification of genes that are mutated in patients with ALS would help devise novel therapeutic strategies as much remains to be discovered about the genetics of ALS. Familial forms of the disease account for only 5-10% of patients. Among these familial cases, about 15-20% are caused by mutations in the zinc/copper superoxide dismutase gene, but the genetic basis of the remaining familial cases and the many sporadic cases continues to be largely unknown. Altogether, the results presented in this thesis came from the use of several strategies to establish the genetic cause of ALS and the related motor neuron disorders like hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) and primary lateral sclerosis (PLS). A concerted and collaborative effort was put forth to identify the gene causative for ALS3 on chromosome 18. In addition, a recently reported locus has been confirmed on chromosome 9p for patients that present both ALS and frontotemporal dementia. The major finding involves the discovery of eight mutations in the TARDBP gene in nine patients with sporadic and familial ALS. Furthermore, a large association study evaluated the role of common polymorphisms in the paraoxonase gene cluster in susceptibility to the development of ALS. In the analysis of upper motor neuron diseases, mutations in a novel gene, KIAA0196, were identified for the HSP locus SPG8 on chromosome 8. Finally, the first locus for PLS was discovered on the p-arm of chromosome 4 following genome scan analysis of a large Quebec family with PLS. These genetic discoveries all contributed novel advances to the field of motor neuron disorders. As more is elucidated regarding the biochemical function of these the proteins encoded by these genes, a more comprehensive picture of ALS and other motor neuron disorders will hopefully emerge.</description><creator>Valdmanis, Paul Nils.</creator><date>2009</date><subject>Motor Neuron Disease -- genetics.</subject><subject>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis -- genetics.</subject><subject>Spastic Paraplegia, Hereditary -- genetics.</subject><subject>DNA-Binding Proteins -- genetics.</subject><title>Genetic analysis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other motor neuron disorders</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bv73c424h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3t945v55v</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Human Genetics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n009w5967</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:17:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Learning processes play a major role in controlling intake of food. Through repeated experiences an animal acquires the ability to predict the postingestive effects of a particular food (i.e., of its nutrients and energy) from its sensory characteristics. What is unclear from the literature, however, is whether an animal can anticipate the duration of subsequent food deprivation from predictive sensory qualities of a food, and hence increase the amount eaten of that cueing food. Therefore, the aim of this work was to investigate the characteristics of this under-researched type of learning, i.e., anticipatory eating, using laboratory rats trained on two lengths of fasting (short: 2-3 h, long: 8-10 h). The main findings were as follows. 1) Anticipatory eating is learnt when a choice is given between protein- and carbohydrate-rich foods as well as on a single balanced test food. 2) The learnt extra intake of food is instrumental to preventing the return of hunger, removal of which negative reinforcement extinguishes the response. 3) The resulting return of hunger induces re-learning of anticipatory eating. 4) During the training sessions, learning of anticipatory eating competes with classical conditioning of sensory preference. Conditioning of preference is likely to be stronger with the shorter than with the longer length of fasting. Therefore, the difference between intakes before the long and the short fast at each trial is the summed result of these two mechanisms of acquired increase in intake. While preference conditioning usually reaches a maximum rapidly, depletion-avoidance increases for as long as has been tested, with interruptions of rapid self-extinction and re-learning, This self-extinction contributes to the homeostatic character of this learning. 5) High-fat maintenance diet attenuates the learning of anticipatory eating. Overall, the findings provided robust evidence that eating in rats can be controlled by instrumental learning reinforced by hunger. Accordingly, the design of an experiment on such instrumental control of eating in human subjects is proposed to conclude this thesis.</description><creator>Jarvandi, Soghra.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Appetite -- Physiological aspects.</subject><subject>Food habits -- Psychological aspects.</subject><subject>Ingestion -- Regulation.</subject><subject>Rats -- Feeding and feeds.</subject><title>Learning processes in food intake</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p8418r92f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n009w5967</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mg74qq83k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:17:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In the past three decades, various steps of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) life cycle have been thoroughly studied. Many of these steps, such as viral entry, reverse transcription and proteolysis have been targets of antiretroviral therapy. Retroviral genomic RNA (gRNA) dimerization appears essential for viral infectivity and this process appears to be chaperoned by the nucleocapsid (NC) protein of HIV-1. In this dissertation, the role of NC in genome dimerization and other aspects of the viral life cycle have been thoroughly studied. Various positions of the NC protein have been mutated through site-directed mutagenesis and relevant and dispensable positions of NC have been identified through this method. 34 of its 55 residues were mutated, individually or in small groups, in a panel of 40 HIV-1 mutants. It was found that the amino-terminus, the proximal zinc finger, the linker, and the distal zinc finger of NC each contributed roughly equally to efficient HIV-1 gRNA dimerization. The various mutations introduced into NC show the first evidence that gRNA dimerization can be inhibited by: 1) mutations in the N-terminus or the linker of retroviral NC; 2) mutations in the proximal or distal zinc finger of lentiviral NC; 3) mutations in the hydrophobic patch (plateau) or the conserved glycines of the proximal or the distal retroviral zinc finger. Some NC mutations impaired gRNA dimerization more than mutations inactivating the viral protease, indicating that gRNA dimerization may be stimulated by the NC component of the Gag polyprotein (Pr55gag). In the second section of my work, I studied the effect of Pr55gag processing on gRNA dimerization by introducing rate alternating mutants into Pr55gag protein cleavage sites. I showed that Maturation ofNCp15 into NCp9 is essential for fast rates of genomic RNA dimerization and maturation of NCp9 into NCp7 has no incidence on genomic RNA dimerization but is essential for viral replication. In order to delineate the amount of viral protease activity needed to produce mature virus 48 hours post transfection, we also studied, by cotransfection studies, the effect of various ratios of wild-type (BH10) and protease-inactive (PR- ) plasmids and found that HIV-1 reaches its full genomic RNA dimerization despite 75% unprocessed Pr55gag polyproteins. We have also shown that wild type BH10 plasmid can rescue those mutations in NCp7 protein that have an effect on gRNA dimerization through rescue experiments. Overall, this thesis sheds light on the role of NC in HIV-1 genome dimerization and other aspects of the viral life cycle and identifies the importance of each component of NC during these processes.</description><creator>Kafaie, Jafar.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Nucleocapsid Proteins -- metabolism.</subject><subject>RNA, Viral -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Dimerization.</subject><subject>HIV-1 -- physiology.</subject><title>Role of the NC protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in viral RNA dimerization and packaging, as well as in virus replication and stability</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7w62fc950.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mg74qq83k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qb98mk070</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:17:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Motor response selection is the process by which an intention to act is transformed into an action; this multifaceted process occurs at the interface between cognitive and motor systems. Despite the importance of response selection, the nature and neural implementation of this process is still a subject of debate (Thompson-Schill et al, 1997; Botvinick et al., 2001; Rushworth et al., 2004; Nachev et al., 2007). While previous research has demonstrated that the selection of finger movements relies on a distributed network involving premotor and prefrontal areas, the specific contribution of these regions, however, remains unclear. It is also unclear if the selection of words engages similar processes as the selection of finger movements, that is, if response selection is a domain-general or a domain-specific process. In order to address these issues, a set of four complementary studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was developed in which different factors affecting response selection were examined: selection mode, response type (words vs. oral movements), attention and response competition (conflict). The results of these studies provide new insights into the neural architecture of response selection by uncovering the respective contribution of premotor areas (pre-SMA and PMA) and prefrontal areas (DLPFC and IFG). A preliminary two-stage model of response selection is proposed, in which the PMA is generating a set of response alternatives from which the pre-SMA performs selection using one of two different mechanisms (response facilitation and response inhibition). In general, these findings do not support the hypothesis of a medio-lateral gradient of control (Goldberg, 1985) but confirm the fundamental role of the lateral (PMA) and medial (pre-SMA) premotor areas in the process of selecting motor responses. Importantly, the results also demonstrate that selection is a domain-general (response-independent) process. Uncovering the general, multifaceted nature of brain mechanisms is essential to reveal the basic units of control in the central nervous system; this knowledge is fundamental to broaden current understanding of the basic brain operations that are used to produce language. Theoretical and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.</description><creator>Tremblay, Pascale.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Mouth -- physiology.</subject><subject>Frontal Lobe -- physiology.</subject><subject>Magnetic Resonance Imaging.</subject><subject>Speech -- physiology.</subject><subject>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.</subject><subject>Gestures.</subject><title>Investigating the neural organisation of response selection and response conflict during language production using functional magnetic resonance imaging and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20sx54q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qb98mk070</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Communication Sciences and Disorders</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ff3658752</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:17:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Aggrecan is one of the most important structural components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of articular cartilage, where it contributes to the hydration of the tissue and its ability to resist compressive loads during joint movement. Increased aggrecan degradation and loss occurs in joint diseases and is thought to be mediated by enzymes such as the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and aggrecanases (ADAMTS). It has also been proposed that aggrecan release from the cartilage can be mediated by a non-proteolytic mechanism which involves the degradation of hyaluronan (RA) to which the aggrecan is bound. As aggrecan degradation and loss is known to be induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1, TNFalpha, IL-6, IL-17 and OSM were used to investigate the mechanisms involved in proteoglycan catabolism in organ cultures of bovine articular cartilage. Irrespective of the cytokine, all aggrecan fragments generated were characteristic of aggrecanase action, and no additional aggrecan-degrading enzymatic activity was detected. In the presence of OSM, more rapid aggrecan release was observed, due to both proteolysis and fragmentation of HA by hyaluronidase activity. Moreover, addition of OSM resulted in the cleavage of aggrecan at a non-canonical aggrecanase site near its carboxy-terminal globular domain. Such cleavage could be reproduced in vitro by the action of either ADAMTS-4 or ADAMTS-5. Gene expression analysis revealed that both aggrecanases were highly induced by the cytokines, and while ADAMTS-4 was the major aggrecanase to be stimulated in all conditions, ADAMTS-5 remains the predominant aggrecanase to be expressed in cartilage. Thus, the present study shows that aggrecanase activity is primarily responsible for aggrecan degradation in the early stages of cytokine stimulation, and that in the presence of OSM, aggrecanase substrate specificity can be differentially modulated and hyaluronidase-mediated RA degradation can be induced.</description><creator>Durigova, Michaela.</creator><date>2009</date><subject>Proteoglycans -- drug effects.</subject><subject>Extracellular Matrix Proteins -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Interleukins -- pharmacology.</subject><subject>Cartilage, Articular -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Oncostatin M -- pharmacology.</subject><title>Mechanisms of proteoglycan aggregate degradation in cytokine-stimulated cartilage</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cc08hk31b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ff3658752</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Surgical Research</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rj4308302</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:17:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Frothers are used in flotation to aid generation of small bubbles, but little is known about the mechanisms that take place in the flotation machine to produce such an effect. Coalescence prevention is the common explanation, although the exact mechanism is obscure and almost no attention has been paid to a frother effect on bubble break-up, the other possible mechanism. This thesis presents a technique to study the effect of frothers on bubble coalescence at the generation stage (at a capillary tube) and a technique to study the effect of frothers on bubble coalescence and break-up in a turbulent field. The first technique is based on the sound bubbles emit when they form and coalesce. The sound signal was linked to bubble formation and coalescence events using high-speed cinematography. The technique has a resolution capable of detecting coalescence events that occur within 1-2 ms. The second technique allows discriminating between coalescence and break-up and is based on the exposure of a mono-size distribution of bubbles to a turbulent field generated by a three-bladed axial flow impeller. Analysis of bubble size distributions after contact with the turbulent field gives the coalescence and break-up fraction. The results show frothers reduce coalescence and alter the bubble size distribution of bubbles generated by break-up. In the course of high-speed imaging an effect of frother on bubble shape and motion after formation was detected. Analysis of this forms the third major component of the work. A dependence of velocity on bubble aspect ratio is shown, which is in line with recent literature.</description><creator>Kracht Gajardo, Willy Andrés, 1979-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Bubbles -- Dynamics.</subject><subject>Surface active agents.</subject><subject>Flotation reagents.</subject><title>Effect of frother on bubble coalescence, break-up, and initial rise velocity</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bc386p29n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rj4308302</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7w62fc968</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:17:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Onchocerciasis, commonly known as "River blindness" is a disease affecting over 37 million people, worldwide. It is caused by the parasitic nematode Onchocerca volvulus and transmitted by the blackfly vector of the genus Simulium. The drug ivermectin (IVM) is the principal means of controlling the disease. As a result of recent reports on sub-optimal response to ivermectin and genetic selection in O. volvulus, we carried out a 21 month epidemiological study to investigate the response of O. volvulus to repeated rounds of IVM treatments in 2501 subjects from 19 Ghanaian communities that have received between 6 and 18 annual treatments and one IVM naive community. Skin microfilaria (mt) assessments were done before IVM treatment and at days 30, 90, 180 and 364 post-IVM treatment. At day 90 after the second IVM treatment, nodulectomies were carried out on 140 patients and embryogrammes constructed on female worms. We found IVM is still an effective microfilaricide, with efficacy of 98-100%. However, its effect on adult worm fertility has been reduced. Day 90 and 180 post-treatment showed significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) skin mf repopulation of 7.1% to 53.9%, and &gt;100% of pretreatment counts at day 364 post-treatment in four communities compared with the other six communities, which had &lt;80% of pretreatment mf counts on day 364. From these results we classified the 10 communities into good IVM response (four communities), intermediate IVM response (two communities), poor IVM response (three communities), and the previously IVM naive community. Nodule and worm viability and worm densities were significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) in the poor response communities compared with the good response communities, with the intermediate falling between the two. Embryogramme analysis showed significantly higher reproductive activity and output in worms from poor response communities with up to 41% of females having live stretched mf in utero compared with good response communities which had no intra-uterine stretched mf. These results show evidence of lack of sustained response of adult O. volvulus to IVM in the poor response communities, manifested as a rapid return to fertility after IVM treatment. We conclude that IVM resistance is emerging in onchocerciasis and is manifested as a loss of effect of IVM on suppression of parasite reproduction. Beta tubulin isotype 1 gene has been shown to be linked to IVM treatment and selection in O. volvulus and veterinary nematodes. Genetic analysis of the full length genomic DNA sequence of beta-tubulin from worms obtained in the three IVM response categories and IVM naive community showed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 24 sites on the entire 3696 bp. The frequencies of eight SNPs were significantly different (p&lt; 0.05) between the poor response communities and the good response/naive communities. Four SNPs, 183 T/G, 1188 T/C, 1309 CIT and 1545 A/G resulting in a genotype configuration GG/CC/TT/GG (183/1188/1309/1545) was significantly higher in the poor IVM response communities than the other communities. The phenotypic and genotypic analyses are consistent with a conclusion that IVM resistance has been selected. These four SNPs could be used to develop a genetic marker for early detection of IVM resistance. This study has shown for the first time that IVM resistance is emerging in Onchocerca volvulus and that there are genetic changes associated with IVM resistance which could be used for epidemiological monitoring for emerging resistance.</description><creator>Osei-Atweneboana, Mike Yaw, 1966-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Onchocerciasis -- Chemotherapy.</subject><subject>Onchocerca volvulus -- Effect of drugs on.</subject><subject>Drug resistance.</subject><subject>Ivermectin.</subject><subject>Onchocerca volvulus -- Molecular genetics.</subject><title>Molecular epidemiology of emerging ivermectin resistance in onchocerciasis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/js956k64v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7w62fc968</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Parasitology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3197xq33m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:17:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis describes the examination of novel block copolymers that contain Ru(bpy)32+ complexes incorporated into one block of diblock copolymers made by ROMP. With the intent of exploring the potential usefulness of these interesting materials in applications such as light-harvesting and sensing, a systematic study of the solution self-assembly, luminescence properties, and the ability of the metal complex to engage in electron and energy transfer reactions has been conducted. The solution self-assembly of block copolymers that contain Ru(bpy) 32+ complexes was examined first. Using a series of these block copolymers, a detailed study of the effects of block length, block ratio, polymer concentration and solution conditions on the copolymer self-assembly is presented. Using TEM, a number of morphologies were reproducibly observed including star micelles, large compound micelles, tubules, and interestingly, vesicles. These structures all contain the metal complex Ru(bpy)3 2+ within their core domains. The luminescence properties of two block copolymers containing Ru(bpy) 32+ were examined: one polymer self-assembled into star micelles, the other into vesicles. Comparison of the unassembled polymer chains and the self-assembled polymers indicated that self-assembly, and confinement of the Ru(bpy)32+ complexes into the core domains of the aggregates, did not seriously adversely affect the luminescence properties of the metal complex. Measurement of the luminescence lifetime decay of the polymers suggested that energy migration occurred among the metal complexes along the polymer chain. The ability of the metal complexes within self-assembled structures to participate in electron transfer reactions with small molecules was also explored. It was found that from within the core domains of self-assembled structures, the Ru(bpy)32+ complexes could still engage in electron transfer reactions with molecules on the outsides or the insides of the aggregates, likely a result of energy migration. The ability of Ru(bpy)32+ complexes within the cores of micelles to participate in energy transfer was explored. Micelles were formed in aqueous solutions using polymers that possessed both the metal complex and a water-soluble block. Several methods were attempted to encapsulate two molecules, a derivative of coumarin 2 and an Os(bpy)3 2+-based molecule, inside these micelles. It was observed that Ru(bpy) 32+ could act as an energy acceptor from the coumarin derivative, and could act as an energy donor to the osmium-based complex. Encapsulation of the small molecules greatly enhanced the efficiency of energy transfer, by non-covalently bringing the small molecules in close proximity to the Ru(bpy)32+ complexes. Polymers were synthesized that contained a Ru(bpy)3 2+-based block and were terminated with the molecular recognition unit biotin. These polymers, upon self-assembly, formed micelles with biotin groups on their periphery. The addition of the protein streptavidin, which has a strong binding affinity for biotin, resulted in the aggregation of the self-assembled structures. This established the potential for self-assembled metal-containing aggregates to form higher-order structures. Early work is presented in Appendix A involving block copolymers that contain hydrogen-bonding groups. Several methods were attempted to elucidate the solution morphologies of these polymers, namely IR, 1H NMR, DLS, and pyrene fluorescence. The transition of this initial work to polymers that contain the Ru(bpy)32+ complex is also described.</description><creator>Metera, Kimberly Lorrainne, 1976-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Luminescence.</subject><subject>Transmission electron microscopy.</subject><subject>Ruthenium compounds.</subject><subject>Self-assembly (Chemistry)</subject><subject>Block copolymers.</subject><title>Self-assembly, luminescence properties and excited state interactions of block copolymers that contain ruthenium tris(bipyridine)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h415pf26v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3197xq33m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5712mb52z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:17:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>There are currently an estimated 33.2 million people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) worldwide. For these individuals, long-term use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is not feasible for a variety of reasons including major adverse complications, multi-drug resistance, poor adherence, and high cost. Hence, development of novel therapeutic strategies that can reduce the life-long dependency on cART is highly desired. In order to develop effective therapeutic strategies such as a therapeutic vaccine, we need to have a greater understanding of the immune correlates of viral control in chronic HIV infection. In this thesis, we used treatment interruption (TI) as a tool to test the efficacy of several therapeutic approaches and immune parameters for their association with effective control of viral replication. In Chapter 2 we showed that cART intensification and Remune vaccination resulted in reduced viral load (VL) plateau during sequential TIs. Although HIV-specific immune responses measured by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) increased in the same time frame, neither their breadth nor magnitude correlated with the decrease in VL plateau. In Chapter 3 the effect of ALVAC-vCP1425 plus Remune vaccination on HIV proteome-wide HIV-specific responses was monitored using a dual color IFN-gamma/interleukin-2 (IL-2) ELISPOT assay. We observed an increase in the magnitude of HIV-specific IFN-gamma/IL-2 responses, as well as in the breadth of Gag-specific IFN-gamma responses in the vaccinated groups compared to placebo groups. A shift towards an increased contribution of Gag-specific responses to total HIV-specific vaccine induced immune response was associated with longer delay to viral rebound during TI. In Chapters 4 and 5, we examined baseline pre-TI immune parameters and their association with viral rebound and CD4 count change during TI in HIV-infected individuals in the chronic phase of infection experiencing virologic failure before TI (Chapter 4) or with different levels of VL control while on therapy prior to TI (Chapter 5). We saw that chronic antigen stimulation from persistent viremia as well as co-infections such as with cytomegalovirus are associated with T-cell senescence, which may result in less favourable clinical outcomes during TI. Consequently, results from this thesis contribute to further understanding of immune correlates of viral control in chronic HIV infection. New therapeutic vaccines and interventions should induce polyfunctional HIV-specific immune responses, broad Gag-specific immune responses, as well as reducing chronic antigen stimulation to prevent irreversible T-cell exhaustion. Taken together, these insights could potentially lead to the development of novel treatment interventions that could effectively control viral replication off cART.</description><creator>Huang, Kenneth Hsing-Chung.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>HIV Infections -- drug therapy.</subject><subject>HIV Infections -- virology.</subject><subject>Viral Load.</subject><subject>HIV Infections -- immunology.</subject><subject>CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes -- immunology.</subject><title>Immune correlates of viral control in chronic HIV infection</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dj52w831f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5712mb52z</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:np193d57h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:17:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The liver is a vital organ, playing numerous critical roles in the body. The liver's ability to perform essential functions is disturbed by injuries that are often associated with many complications such as calcification. Although many reports in the literature document observations of liver calcification, the mechanisms regulating this phenomenon remain unclear. Herein, we aim to investigate the cellular and molecular events that occur during pathological calcification of the liver. To study the mechanisms of calcification, assessments included histological-staining, immunolabeling, and biochemical and electron microscopy analyses. The findings suggest that calcification may result from hydroxyapatite precipitation in necrotic or apoptotic hepatocytes. Similarly, calcification may be associated with differentiated myofibroblasts expressing bone matrix proteins downstream of TGFbeta signalling. To identify specific protein regulators linked to the various stages in calcification, and to assess the protein composition of the tissue, a proteomic analysis was used. This analysis identified IQGAP1, an effector of the Rho-GTPases and a master regulator of cell adhesion and migration. IQGAP1 is strongly expressed in myofibroblasts, suggesting that IQGAP1 may be implicated in myofibroblasts migrating towards calcification. Studies on IQGAP1 interactions with its binding partners reveal that it is part of a protein complex that includes beta-catenin, an adhesion protein, and Rac1, a cytoskeletal regulator. These results suggest that IQGAP1 may play an important role in myofibroblast migration upon liver injury. Having identified that activin and TGFbeta signalling are activated in myofibroblasts, we hypothesised that they may stimulate myofibroblast differentiation and proliferation. Studies using a C3H/10T1/2 cell model reveal that both activin and TGFbeta stimulate differentiation, but only activin induces cell proliferation in a Smad-independent fashion, which requires activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway. In summary, this work provides new mechanistic insights on the global regulation of liver calcification. The various phases of this work collectively cover the central role of myofibroblasts in liver injury: association with calcification, rapid proliferation, differentiation to an activated form, and migration toward the injured area. The findings allow us to better understand the mechanisms by which liver myofibroblasts are regulated in a specific pathological context.</description><creator>Kalantari, Fariba.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Liver Transplantation -- pathology.</subject><subject>ras GTPase-Activating Proteins -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Calcinosis -- etiology.</subject><subject>Liver Diseases -- pathology.</subject><title>A cellular and molecular approach to investigate pathological calcification in liver /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2v23vx66d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/np193d57h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2r36v2216</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:17:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in a well-orchestrated inflammatory response which causes secondary tissue damage. Activated macrophages contribute to this cytotoxic response, which includes damage to neurons, glia and myelin, and tissue loss that worsens functional outcomes after SCI. However, activated macrophages in the spinal cord under other conditions are not cytotoxic, such as after intraspinal injection of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), a potent demyelinating agent. Recovery from SCI may be optimized by reducing the detrimental effects of macrophages while promoting their beneficial ones. Therefore, I compared spinal cord tissue, as well as purified macrophages, from mice after SCI (cytotoxic response) and intraspinal LPC injection (non-cytotoxic response). As a first step to carry out this work, I characterized the injury parameters for SCI contusion injury (i.e. injury force and spinal cord displacement) in mice using the Infinite Horizons impactor (Chapter 2). This lesioning model was used in other work for the thesis. The role T cells may play in mediating macrophage activation after LPC microinjection and SCI was also assessed using Nude mice (Chapter 3). Next, Affymetrix GeneChip analysis was carried out on spinal cord tissue obtained at the peak of the macrophage response after SCI and intraspinal LPC injection to identify potential candidate genes that may control the divergent inflammatory responses (Chapter 4). Several potential genes were identified. I next characterized the expression and role of one of these genes, MAPK activated protein kinase 2 (MK2), and showed that it mediates secondary tissue damage after SCI via several mechanisms (Chapter 5). The differences in gene expression profiles of macrophages purified from the spinal cord after SCI and LPC-injection were also assessed (Chapter 6). This microarray analysis of macrophages led to the identification of 10 novel candidate genes, two of which were validated at the protein level. Finally, I also examined the expression and role of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) in SCI (Chapter 7). Using a combination of knockout/overexpressing transgenic mice and recombinant SLPI, I found that SLPI mediates protective anti-inflammatory effects after SCI. In conclusion, work done for this thesis has led to the identification of several novel molecules that influence the inflammatory response after injury and thus have led to the identification of potentially novel targets for the development of pharmacological approaches to treat acute SCI.</description><creator>Ghasemlou, Nader.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Inflammation -- etiology.</subject><subject>Mice, Inbred BALB C.</subject><subject>Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases -- genetics.</subject><subject>Lysophosphatidylcholines.</subject><subject>Spinal Cord Injuries -- complications.</subject><subject>Mice.</subject><title>Cellular and molecular characterization of inflammation in the injured spinal cord</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5x21tk14c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36v2216</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9880vv58k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:17:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Phosphorylation of the alpha-subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha) on Serine 51 (Ser51) is an early event associated with downregulation of protein synthesis at the level of translation and constitutes a potent mechanism to overcome various stress conditions. In mammals, four eIF2alpha-kinases PERK, PKR, HRI and GCN2, activated following specific stresses, have been involved in this process. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that the adaptor protein Nck, composed only of Src homology domains and classically implicated in cell signaling by activated plasma membrane receptor tyrosine kinases, modulates translation through its interaction with the beta-subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2beta). Moreover, we reported that Nck-1 overexpression antagonizes the inhibition of translation in endoplasmic reticulum stress condition and prevents the PERK-mediated phosphorylation of the alpha-subunit of eIF2 on Ser51. In this thesis, I demonstrate that the adaptor protein Nck-1 modulates eIF2alpha-kinase-mediated eIF2alphaSer51 phosphorylation in a specific manner. More particularly, I show that Nck-1 overexpression reduces eIF2alpha phosphorylation in conditions activating PKR or HRI as described previously for PERK. In contrast, I observe that overexpression of Nck-1 in mammalian cells fails to attenuate eIF2alphaSer51 phosphorylation in response to amino acid starvation, a stress condition activating GCN2. I further confirm this observation by showing that Nck-1 fails to alter eIF2alphaSer51 phosphorylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for which the sole eIF2alpha-kinase is GCN2. In addition, I report that Nck-1 reduces PKR activation in response to dsRNA. I also find that Nck-1 reduces dsRNA-induced activation of p38 MAPK, a PKR-downstream substrate, and cell death. Finally, I show that Nck-1 interacts exclusively with the inactivated form of PKR in a Src homology domain independent manner. All together these data uncover the existence of a novel mechanism regulating phosphorylation of eIF2alphaSer51 under various stress conditions and identifies Nck-1 as a modulator of the tumor suppressor and antiviral protein kinase PKR.</description><creator>Cardin, Eric.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Serine -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Oncogene Proteins -- physiology.</subject><subject>Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2 -- metabolism.</subject><subject>eIF-2 Kinase -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing -- physiology.</subject><title>Function of Nck-1 adaptor protein as modulator of elF2alpha phosphorylation by specific elF2alpha kinases and PKR activity</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/41687m901.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9880vv58k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5138jj17w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:17:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Guided by a feminist intersectionality framework and conducted within an action research paradigm, this dissertation reports on how social workers in community health care respond to concerns of intimate partner abuse in the lives of older women. The study was undertaken in 18 publicly-funded community health and social services agencies (CLSCs) in Quebec, Canada. Interviews were carried out with 30 social workers and three focus groups were held with some of the same social workers. In this dissertation, I argue that social workers in community health care might benefit from using certain theoretical frameworks, as they tend to see older women as a homogeneous group, view older women's agency as problematic, and lack a cohesive understanding of the problem of intimate partner abuse -- all of which leaves them less than optimally equipped for intervention. Furthermore, certain features of intimate partner abuse at the intersection of gender, age, and disability can make intervention very complex. As a result, social workers tend to view intimate partner abuse in the lives of older women as an intractable problem, rife with double-binds, contradictions, and tensions, which can leave them feeling powerless. In the first three chapters of this dissertation I present the study's theoretical framework, its location within the empirical scholarship on intimate partner abuse, and the methods used. I also provide background information on the Quebec context of practice. Chapters 4 and 5 are empirical chapters reporting the findings as they relate to social workers' understandings and their responses. Chapter 6 is the concluding chapter and discusses the three principal findings. The first key finding was that the practice setting shapes social workers' understandings of and responses to the problem. The second key finding was that social workers could benefit from certain theoretical frameworks that would greatly enhance their practice. The third finding is that social workers view intimate partner abuse as both enduring and changing in form, frequency, and intensity over time. The implications for theory, practice, and research are offered for each key finding.</description><creator>Straka, Silvia M.</creator><date>2009</date><subject>Social workers.</subject><subject>Abused women -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Abused elderly -- Québec (Province).</subject><title>How social workers in community health care understand and respond to concerns of intimate partner abuse in the lives of older women</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zs25xd34d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5138jj17w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:r207ts75t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:17:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis consists of three essays which explore different economic issues emerging in today's globalized world economy. Using a model of outsourcing by monopolistically competitive firms, the first essay shows that, even in the case of flexible domestic wages, international outsourcing (and/or re-location of plants to a low-wage economy) by home firms may worsen the welfare of the home country and reduce the profits of all firms in the industry, even though it is individually rational for each firm to choose to outsource. It shows that if a social planner for the home country can choose the extent of international outsourcing, his optimal choice will not coincide with the equilibrium outcome under laissez-faire. A wage subsidy may improve welfare. When the wage in the home country is rigid we show that outsourcing is welfare-improving for the home country if and only if the sum of the "trade creation" effect and the "exploitation effect" exceeds the "trade diversion" effect of the access to the low-wage labour in the foreign country. The essay also assesses the model in a two-period framework, where each domestic firm faces the choice between outsourcing (or re-location) in the first period, or in the second period. Delaying outsourcing can be gainful because the fixed cost of outsourcing may fall over time. On the other hand, delaying means the firm's variable production cost in period 1 will be higher than that of rivals who are outsourcing. The equilibrium of this two-period game may involve some firms outsourcing in period 1, while others will outsource in period 2, even though ex-ante they are identical firms. Under monopolistic competition, in equilibrium, the sum of discounted profits is identical for all firms. Again, a social planner for the home country may choose a different speed of outsourcing than the speed achieved by an industry under laissez-faire. The second essay explores the market for fair-trade products. It employs a duopoly model involving a firm producing a fair-trade product in competition against a conventional firm producing a standard product. The concept of "economic identity" (Akerlof and Kranton, 2000) is used to model consumers' demand for fair-trade products. The essay shows how, in the short run, the parameters of the identity function can impact the equilibrium prices, and in the medium run, how they impact the conventional firm's choice of its position in the product space. In the long run, however, the fair-trade firm may be able to influence the parameters of the identity function, for its own advantage. The last essay uses the contest model (Tullock, 1980, Rowley et al., 1988, Hillman and Riley, 1989, Nitzan, 1994) to assess welfare effects of bilateral liberalization of government procurement. It shows that there exists a single condition that ensures active participations of all firms in all contests. When this condition is violated, i.e. under a dominant-country case, the dominating country always gains from trade liberalization, while welfare of the dominated country improves only if its corporate tax is sufficiently high. Under full participation of all firms, i.e. no country dominates the markets, and countries are partially symmetric, there exist conditions where bilateral liberalization is mutually beneficial to both countries. When countries are completely asymmetric, it is showed that a country may gain from bilateral trade liberalization if its tax rate is sufficiently high, while the tax rate of the other country is sufficiently low. The results obtained in this essay have shed lights on the current position of negotiations on liberalizing government procurement within the WTO. They suggest plurilateral agreements on government procurement could be formed among countries with similar economic conditions. Such agreements, however, are hard to reach between countries with a large degree of economic asymmetry.</description><creator>Do, Viet Dung, 1975-</creator><date>2009</date><subject>Globalization -- Economic aspects.</subject><subject>Globalization -- Economic aspects -- Mathematical models.</subject><title>Three essays in the economics of globalization</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fx719q754.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r207ts75t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Economics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2n49t5847</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:17:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Macrophages are active participants in many important biological processes, including antimicrobial activity, tumour surveillance, apoptotic cell clearance, homeostasis and wound healing. The activity of all cells is under the direct influence of their genetic makeup and macrophages are no exception. Natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 (Nramp1, also known as SLC11A1) is a macrophage-restricted gene that confers resistance to intracellular pathogens in mice. Mitogen activated protein kinase activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK-2 or MK2), a substrate of p38 MAPK, is known to influence the activation of macrophages in response to stressors, including the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 ligand LPS. Like NRAMP1, MK2 has also been shown to influence the efficiency of the antibacterial response. The present study evaluates the role of NRAMP1 and MK2 in TLR-mediated cytokine induction and their role in cutaneous wound healing. Mice lacking NRAMP1 are severely impaired in their rate of cutaneous wound healing. Nramp1 gene ablation has been associated with lower levels of SLPI, a protein previously demonstrated to influence the rate of wound healing in a non-redundant fashion. Macrophages derived from Nramp1-null mice are less efficient in activating p38 MAPK signaling, which results in lower levels of MK2 phosphorylation. The reduced level of p38 MAPK and MK2 activation in Nramp1-null macrophages also correlates with decreased cytokine induction in response to TLR7 ligand stimulation of these cells. Using p38 MAPK inhibitor and MK2-deficient macrophages, we demonstrate that TLR7- and TLR9-mediated cytokine induction is directly under the control of this signaling pathway. Furthermore, cytokine induction is regulated by MK2 at the post-transcriptional level. Macrophage-induced cytokines play an important role in cutaneous wound healing. Since MK2-deficient macrophages are severely impaired in their ability to induce cytokines following activation, we next evaluated the role of MK2 in cutaneous wound healing. Our results demonstrate that the rate of wound healing is significantly delayed in the absence of MK2. The level of cytokine expression in the wounds is impaired and macrophages are major players in cutaneous wound healing. Our data also show that intradermal transfer of macrophages with intact MK2 significantly improved wound healing kinetics. Overall, the studies presented in this dissertation demonstrate the importance of NRAMP1 and MK2 in the modulation of macrophage gene expression, and their important role in the control of cutaneous wound healing.</description><creator>Thuraisingam, Thusanth.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Wound Healing -- genetics.</subject><subject>Cation Transport Proteins -- genetics.</subject><subject>Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases -- genetics.</subject><subject>Skin -- cytology.</subject><title>Macrophage regulatory genes Nramp1 and MK2 : implication in inflammation and cutaneous wound healing</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0c483n84r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2n49t5847</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Human Genetics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3197xq34w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:17:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Severe anemia is the most prevalent life-threatening complication of malaria infection. In addition to destruction of red blood cells (RBC), decreased RBC production or erythropoietic suppression has been shown to contribute to malarial anemia. The mechanism of this suppression is unknown, but it is considered to be multifactorial since erythropoietic suppression can be observed in the presence of both inflammatory mediators and parasite-derived factors. Experiments presented in this thesis aimed at determining the role of host cytokines released in response to blood-stage malaria infection and parasite-derived factors in erythropoietic suppression underlying the development of malarial anemia. Pro-inflammatory cytokines released during malaria infection have been proposed to play a central role in erythroid suppression. To dissect the discrete roles of these cytokines in the processes leading to anemia, mice were treated with CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODN) which, like malaria infection in humans and experimental mouse models, induces an acute type 1 pro-inflammatory response. CpG-ODN treatment induced anemia, which was associated with suppressed erythropoiesis and reduced RBC survival. Importantly, CpG-ODN-induced IFN-gamma was found to be the major factor mediating erythropoietic suppression but not decreased RBC survival. We also studied the roles of Th1, Th2 and anti-inflammatory cytokines produced in response to Plasmodium chabaudi AS infection in the development of erythropoietic suppression during blood-stage malaria. Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)6, required for signaling of the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, was shown to play a critical role in malarial anemia by inhibiting the proliferation and differentiation of erythroid cells. We also observed that suppressed erythropoiesis is a general feature in mice infected with various rodent Plasmodium species that differ in their clinical manifestations and immune responses. Since parasite-derived factors have been shown to contribute to malarial pathogenesis including anemia, the contribution of P. falciparum - and P. yoelii-derived products to erythropoietic suppression was investigated. Both Plasmodium-derived and synthetic hemozoin (Hz) suppressed the proliferation but not the maturation of erythroid progenitor cells in vitro. However, P. yoelii-derived Hz but not synthetic Hz induced transient anemia in mice. These findings provide novel insights into the complex interactions between the parasite and host immune system and the regulation of erythropoiesis during severe malarial anemia.</description><creator>Thawani, Neeta.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Erythrocytes -- parasitology.</subject><subject>Erythrocyte Count.</subject><subject>Plasmodium chabaudi.</subject><subject>Malaria -- parasitology.</subject><subject>Anemia -- parasitology.</subject><subject>Erythropoiesis.</subject><title>The contribution of host-and parasite-derived factors to erythropoietic suppression underlying the development of malarial anemia /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7h149t32q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3197xq34w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:765374688</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:17:34Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Recent years have witnessed a tremendous growth in the number of gold-catalyzed highly selective chemical transformations. The aim of this study was to develop new gold catalytic methods to mediate carbon-carbon, carbon-oxygen and carbon-nitrogen bond forming reactions. Chapter 2 describes new annulations catalyzed by gold(I) of simple o-hydroxyaldehydes with alkynes. This annulation efficiently generates isoflavanone-type structures, which have many possible applications in the synthesis of isoflavanone natural products. This chapter details the development and the optimization of the reaction conditions. The annulation was applied to various aldehydes and arylalkynes with good efficiency. Furthermore, it incorporated all atoms of both starting materials into the product and thus has a theoretical atom economy of 100%. Chapter 3 extends the scope of the annulations developed in Chapter 2. Indeed, 2,3-dihydro-1-tosylquinolin-3(1H)-one derivatives, aza-isoflavanones, have been efficiently synthesized via a gold-catalyzed annulation of 2-tosylaminobenzaldehyde and alkynes. The annulation was applied to various arylalkynes with good efficiency. This annulation can be used for the synthesis of a range of potentially bioactive molecules. Chapter 4 describes applications in the total synthesis of the annulation developed in chapter 2. (+/-)-Pterocarpan and analogues have been efficiently synthesized via the annulation of salicylaldehydes and o-methoxymethoxylphenylacetylene followed by a one-pot reduction and acidic cyclization of the ketones. In addition, isoflavone derivatives have been synthesized rapidly via the annulation of salicylaldehyde and arylacetylenes followed by IBX/DMSO oxidation of the isoflavanones. As part of our ongoing studies on metal-catalyzed atom economical reactions, the gold/silver-catalyzed addition of arenes to mono-substituted allene, generate exclusive terminal addition products are described in Chapter 5. Finally, Appendix A explores the use of commercially available polymer-supported triphenylphosphine as a catalyst for the efficient gamma-addition of methyl 2-butynoate with various pronucleophiles. In addition, optimization studies shows no need of a co-catalyst for the reaction in the presence of a mixture of water:toluene (5:1). The polymer-supported triphenylphosphine is recoverable and can be reused efficiently. This gamma-addition is highly atom-economical and the reaction time was reduced under microwave irradiation.</description><creator>Skouta, Rachid.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Isoflavones -- Synthesis.</subject><title>Gold-catalyzed carbon-carbon, carbon-oxygen and carbon-nitrogen bond formations : efficient synthesis of isoflavanones, aza-isoflavanones, [plus or minus symbol]-pterocarpans and isoflavones</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q524js55x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/765374688</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:f7623h195</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:17:35Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk can be lowered by introduction of plant sterols (PS) in the diet, since PS have been shown to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Given that the efficacy of PS as cholesterol-lowering agents depends on their appropriate solubilization, the cholesterol-lowering efficacy of PS in non-traditional matrices needs to be determined. The primary aim of this thesis was to examine the consumption of PS (a) in an oil rich in medium chain triglycerides (MCT) or (b) low-fat yogurt with or without a meal, on changes in lipid parameters. Additional objectives were: (1) to assess the effects of MCT with PS on body composition and energetics, (2) to compare the effects of PS in low-fat matrix consumed with or without a meal on cholesterol synthesis, (3) to evaluate the risks of PS in low-fat matrix on blood levels of carotenoids and fat-soluble vitamin, and (4) to investigate the relationship between the response to PS, cholesterol kinetics and genotyping. For this purpose two randomized, controlled, crossover-feeding trials were conducted. First, 23 overweight, hyperlipidemic men consumed PS in MCT or olive oil control for six weeks each. In the second trial, 26 hyperlipidemic subjects consumed a placebo yogurt, a PS-enriched yogurt consumed with a meal, or afternoon PS-enriched yogurt as a snack for four weeks each. PS, mixed within a MCT matrix, lower plasma total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C without changing the high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. However, no changes in body composition or energetics were observed. Secondly, a PS-enriched low-fat yogurt as snack lowered TC, along with a lowering trend in LDL-C, to greater extent compared to when consumed with a meal without any risk of deficiency in fat-soluble antioxidants. An increase in cholesterol biosynthesis was also observed in both PS phases compared to control phase. In addition, three non-responsive subjects to PS intervention who had higher cholesterol absorption rates were observed; however, no recognizable pattern of genetic polymorphisms was detected. Overall, these novel matrices for PS incorporation consumed with or between meals may be an effective way of decreasing the risk of CVD; however, some individuals respond better to PS intervention.</description><creator>Rudkowska, Iwona.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Phytosterols.</subject><subject>Triglycerides.</subject><subject>Hyperlipidemia -- Nutritional aspects.</subject><subject>Low-fat foods.</subject><subject>Sterols -- Physiological effect.</subject><subject>Blood lipids.</subject><title>Efficacy of plant sterols in novel matrices on blood lipids profiles : medium chain triglycerides and low-fat products consumed with or without a meal</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/47429f091.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f7623h195</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):17375</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
