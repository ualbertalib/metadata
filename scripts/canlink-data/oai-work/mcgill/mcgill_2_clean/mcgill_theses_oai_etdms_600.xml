This thesis begins by analyzing the characteristics of high-performance electronic backplanes and argues that electronic backplanes face fundamental cost/performance limitations which free-space optical backplanes can overcome provided key problems such as maintaining mechanical alignment in an industrial setting are resolved. An analysis of misalignment mechanisms indicates that active alignment is a powerful solution to the problem of optical alignment. A review of active alignment in other optical systems such as compact disk players and telescopes is then conducted. The central part of this thesis presents the theoretical design, simulation, fabrication and testing of a novel active alignment demonstrator system based on Risley Beam Steerers. The demonstrator features a quadrant detector which detects the misalignment error between the centre of a spot of light and the centre of the quadrant detector. This misalignment error is then used by a new algorithm to calculate the rotational displacement required for the two Risley Beam Steerers to steer the spot of light to the centre of the quadrant detector. This experimental system contains all the necessary optics, optomechanics, electronics, and computer hardware and software required to demonstrate the task of centering the spot. The experimental results indicate that any spot misaligned by up to 160 $ mu$m on the quadrant detector will be systematically centered by the demonstrator system. Future directions for active alignment are then presented and discussed.</description><creator>Boisset, Guillaume C.</creator><contributor>Hinton, H.

Preventive controls attempt to restrain the development of congestion by shaping or filtering the incoming cell streams at the user-network interface, independently of the dynamics of the network itself. Preventive controls have a policing function, to protect the network from overload due to malice or malfunction on the user side of the interface, and a regulating function, to smooth the demand on network storage and bandwidth in the hope of improving network performance. We study the regulating function in simple ATM systems in which the transmission line buffers are depleted in FIFO (first in, first out) order. Our point of departure is the observation, formulated as a theorem, that regulation controls the location, rather than the amplitude, of network-induced impairments, moving cell losses from inside the network to the network boundary, but at the price of increased overall loss or delay. We display the tradeoff between interior and end-to-end blocking for the Leaky Bucket regulator applied to Poisson sources, showing how efficiency, measured in different ways, diminishes with the number of sources. We examine the interplay between cell loss rate and worst case delay, again for Poisson sources, and assuming that the Leaky Bucket has been optimized for one of the two criteria, subject to a constraint on the other. Our results suggest that worst-case delay bounds can be very conservative in a variety of settings, and that FIFO networks using preventive controls only, and on a per-session basis, will be under-controlled.</description><creator>Abousleiman, Assaad C.</creator><contributor>Kaplan, Michael (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Regulation and resource utilization in ATM systems</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8049g702b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vd66w1765</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fx719p260</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:08:08Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis addresses the determinants of militia decision-making. Focussing on the Lebanese Forces (LF), the major Christian militia in Lebanon's Civil War, it analyses the motives which drove the LF to accept the Ta'if Accord--an acceptance that stands in stark contrast to its rejection of two earlier settlement blueprints, the Lausanne talks and the Tripartite Agreement. Steering away from the literature's focus on ideology as the prime mover of militias, the research explores other dimensions of militia decision-making, notably the impact of inter-communal power struggles, of the extra-communal balance of power, and of the international setting. Particular attention is given to the impact of the process of institutionalization. By rendering decisions more sensitive to cost-benefit and other prasmatic considerations, institutionalization is insruumental in bringing the more hawkish of militias to the negotiation table and in opening a window of opportunity for lasting conflict resolution.</description><creator>Zahar, Marie-Joëlle</creator><contributor>Brynen, Rex (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Decision making.</subject><subject>Lebanon -- Politics and government -- 1975-1990</subject><title>The Lebanese Forces and the Ta'if Accord : militia decision-making in theoretical perspective</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n870zs65b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fx719p260</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5d86p2307</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:08:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is a study of Ibn Sin a's concept of the Perfect Man, which is studied here with reference to the role of the faculties of the soul.

At the religious level, both modernists were much concerned with the purification of Islam. They called upon the Muslims to return to the Qur' an and hadith, abandon taqlid and to undertake ijtihad. Ahmad Kh an, influenced by the natural sciences and rationalism of the West, was also inclined to interpret Islam in a naturalistic and rational manner. Ahmad Hassan, on the other hand, was very much preoccupied with the purification of Islam and the return to the Qur' an and hadith, and was little influenced by the Western impact through colonialism. At the social level, both modernists considered education to be the essential means to social betterment. But whereas Ahmad Kh an also believed in cooperation with the British, Ahmad Hassan was opposed to the Dutch. This study concludes by showing that, given the Western colonial experience, Ahmad Kh an's socio-religious thought was rational, realistic, liberal and dynamic. While Ahmad Hassan too lived in a colonial society, his socio-religious thought was puritanical, defensive and ideological.</description><creator>Yahya, Agusni</creator><contributor>Alvi, Sajida S.

Egon Guba's model of policy analysis, its policy-definition driven research process, and its categories of policy-in-intention and policy-in-implementation usefully assisted the appraisal of logical congruence between the goals and objectives stated in the 13 guidelines of the education policy (a policy-in-intention) and those stated in documents from a sample of supported programs (policies-in-implementation). In addition, the DWO's program-based budget practice was assessed for any relevant use of the Planning Programming Budgeting System (PBBS). Finally, a logical congruence between Guba's model and the PBBS model was probed for a possible synthesis. Documents from 1981, 1985, and 1989 from the sample of five programs from five regions in three continents were reviewed. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)</description><creator>Wishart, James D.

INFECTRON teaches students how the body protects itself from invading germs. Students were presented the animation and oral narration concurrently, successively and compared to a control group. Subjects were 30 LD and 30 NLD in grades 7 and 8 attending a large comprehensive high school in Montreal. Measures included a pretest, posttest, reasoning tasks, and a retention test. Results indicated that students (LD and NLD) in the computer conditions (concurrent and successive) outperformed students (LD and NLD) in the control condition on the pre, post and reasoning tasks. No significant differences were found between students (LD and NLD) in the concurrent group and students (LD and NLD) in the successive group on the post test and reasoning tasks.

Benjamin's Arcades Project is considered in light of his attempts to resituate primary structuring dichotomies in a fluid and dynamic configuration. These dichotomies include the political and the apolitical, the material and the immaterial, and the past and the present. The phantasmagoria-as-metaphor is then employed as a methodological framework for analyzing the ever-circulating images of John F. Kennedy. This thesis is primarily concerned with the conceptual tools necessary to argue that an image is more "real" than its real-life counterpart, that is, real enough to carry resonances that extend beyond both its diminutive "artifice", and its original context. The relations between the immaterial image and its material referent are discussed as complementary and shifting, rather than oppositional and static. This thesis explores the possible and the actual convergence of the image and its material counterparts.</description><creator>Wasson, Haidee</creator><contributor>Burnett, Ron (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Benjamin, Walter, 1892-1940.</subject><subject>Kennedy, John F.

The importance of the vocabulary used to frame these debates is demonstrated through a survey of popular feminist discourses in the 1920s, and the circulation of the term 'postfeminism' in 1980s and 1990s mainstream and feminist media, academic journals, and bestselling books. Foremost among these contexts are mainstream newspaper and magazine articles in which postfeminism is used as a descriptive term applied to trends in fashion, television and film. Through an investigation of the texts and contexts in which post feminism is used, associations to generational disparity, antifeminism, the 'death of feminism,' commercialism, and other 'post-' discourses such as postmodernism, will be illustrated. In the process, it will be demonstrated that feminism, as it is represented through discourses of postfeminism, resides in an area of cultural criticism which straddles the spheres of the academic and the popular.</description><creator>Wallace, Aurora</creator><contributor>Straw, Will (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Feminist theory.</subject><subject>Feminism -- History -- 20th century.</subject><title>Of shadowboxing and straw-women : postfeminist texts and contexts</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pz50gz124.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0k225d000</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Graduate Communications Program</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6969z293x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:08:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this study I hope to clarify some misconceptions about the female characters which appear in the novels of Miguel de Unamuno. The female agonista follows a slightly different pattern than does the male. Unamuno always includes evidence of social limitations which hinder the female agonista's quest for perpetuation. While she may be as ambitious, egoistic and wilfull as her male counterpart, this does not always ensure success. She must also defy conventional thinking in order to achieve her goals. By studying the agonistas and some of the secondary female characters, I hope to prove that Unamuno's characterization of women is deliberate. The two contrasting types, secondary characters and agonistas, are extremes and should be read as such. The repeated inclusion in the narrative of the female social condition indicates that Unamuno is aware of and concerned by gender distinction. The fact that his agonistas, who challenge convention, are granted conditional success is proof that Unamuno validates their attempts.</description><creator>Vialard, Ana</creator><contributor>Duimette, Victor (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Sex role in literature.</subject><subject>Unamuno, Miguel de, 1864-1936 -- Characters -- Women.</subject><subject>Women in literature.</subject><title>Un estudio del personaje femenino unamuniano que busca eternizarse</title><language>spa</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/44558g236.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6969z293x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Hispanic Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q524jq814</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:08:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Research efforts concerned with the implementation of reliable computer-based score followers were first presented at the 1984 International Computer Music Conference independently by Roger Dannenberg and Barry Vercoe. Over the past ten years, much has been done to advance the accuracy and reliability of such systems and yet, little of this development has integrated new or existing ideas concerning the tracking of a performer's rhythm. The research undertaken in this study has attempted to suggest one possibility for such an integration through the design and implementation of a prototype score follower that uses temporal patterns from a live performer as its primary information to determine score location. The simultaneous tracking of pitch information provides an alternate performer position when temporal pattern prediction fails. Testing of the system was performed on both monophonic and polyphonic works spanning four musical eras.</description><creator>Vantomme, Jason D.

Where, when and how does it manifest itself? This study attempts to answer these questions in a diachronic and semiotic perspective.

The coping resources (i.e. psychological and social resources) and coping efforts of 21 children (9 male, 12 female) diagnosed with cancer were assessed and compared with standardized norms. Within-group differences were explored as the cancer sample was subdivided by stage of therapy (i) newly diagnosed, (ii) currently in treatment, and (iii) off treatment. Results suggest that children with cancer differed significantly from typical children on measures of coping effort (Coping Inventory) in that they demonstrated relatively more adaptive and efficient coping behavior as compared to their normative peers. Children with cancer differed slightly from typical children on measures of psychological resources (Assessment of Coping Style) such that they utilized a slightly more restrictive style of coping.

The present study investigates the distinguishing characteristics of these two expert reviewers, in particular the type and amount of oral feedback they produced and the cognitive processes they engaged in. The think-aloud method was employed to obtain feedback about a six page instructional unit from eight experts; four subject matter and four learner experts. Comments from the experts were transcribed, segmented and coded according to three coding systems. Results indicated that the two groups produced similar data. In addition, the findings showed that both groups referred to similar domains of knowledge, evoked or constructed similar plans and identified their task as detecting problems. These findings contradict the use of both types of experts during formative evaluation. Some practical recommendations for practitioners are offered.</description><creator>Tremblay, Diana</creator><contributor>Weston, C. B.

Examining works by Pablo Picasso and then turning my attention to Ezra Pound's Cantos, I seek to establish, within the related frameworks of visual and verbal collage respectively, a structural model of these and other such works predicated upon the continuity, not the distinctiveness, of fragment and host-text. Collage, I hope to show, is necessarily organic in structure due to the unstable nature of the linguistic sign, a phenomenon of language that informs the thesis from beginning to end. Ultimately, I aim to present this model as a metaphor for perception generally, as both a delineation and demonstration of the way in which one comes to know the world.</description><creator>Tortell, David</creator><contributor>Wees, William C.

The labour of children is significant because of marginal household incomes. This thesis is an assessment of the credit program of one community based Non-Government Organization in Manila. The Family and Children for Empowerment (FCED), attempts to augment household incomes through the provision of low interest loans to women for informal micro-enterprises. The study is exploratory. The results reveal that most beneficiaries have achieved an income high enough to prevent their children from working and give families the opportunity to improve their standards of living. However, limitations exist in the informal sector which hinder the expansion and stability of the enterprises. Also, the cooperative credit program itself is at a critical stage. The study finds an urgent need for the cooperative to implement measures for capital build-up if it wants to continue to subsidize and provide its low interest credit loans to urban poor petty traders and products.</description><creator>Tañada, Cristina R.</creator><contributor>Eschen, Donald von (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Informal sector (Economics) -- Philippines.</subject><subject>Philippines -- Economic conditions -- 1986-</subject><subject>Loans -- Philippines -- Case studies.</subject><subject>Urban poor -- Philippines.</subject><subject>Family and Children for Empowerment and Development (Philippines)</subject><title>The sustainability of credit assistance to the urban poor : a Philippine case study</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pr76f5532.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jw827d63d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Sociology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:00000211x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:08:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Over the ages, rural women in subsistence and near-subsistence economies have maintained a sustainable relationship with the environment. This has been manifested in their different roles as users, producers, managers, and income providers. However, the introduction of Western-style development emulating the growth patterns of the North has not only overlooked the needs of the environment but also the needs and knowledge of women. The uninhibited exploitation of nature through development has started eroding the environment. In addition, with the marginalization of women from development schemes, women's cultural, social, economic, and legal status has regressed even further than it was. With no appropriate education, these women have been left defenceless in their confrontation with a changing and frequently adverse environment. Although literature abounds with studies on women, education, and the environment, few studies attempt to link the three together within the framework of sustainable development. This information gap seems to have hindered development projects from implementing education programs targeting women and focusing on the environment. This study seeks to fill this information gap. Based on rural women's holistic vision of development, it highlights the necessity of empowering women with a participatory, multifaceted, and integrated nonformal education, which targets gender equity as well as environmental protection and regeneration.</description><creator>Taji, Mona El</creator><contributor>Ghosh, Ratna (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Rural women -- Education -- Developing countries</subject><subject>Environmental education -- Developing countries</subject><title>Rural women, the environment and nonformal education in countries of the South</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mc87ps55z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/00000211x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Administration and Policy Studies in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qr46r3015</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:08:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis examines Muhammad 'Abduh's ideas on Islamic Law, and the extent to which his writings influenced subsequent Muslim reformers in the sphere of law. The study focuses on 'Abduh's views on ijtihad and its application in modern society. The principle of ijtihad, as practised by 'Abduh, was not dependent upon the opinions of previous scholars. A leading reformer of Islamic law (1849-1905), 'Abduh rejected taqlid which in nineteenth century Egypt was the rule of the day. Scholars in his day adhered to the books of their respective madhhabs to the extent of choosing to ignore the main sources of Islamic law, viz. the Qur'an and Hadith. For this reason, 'Abduh did not follow any particular madhhab in his ijtihad, but chose to be guided by whichever school of law he believed was best fit to deal with a particular contemporary problem. This practice has come to be known as talfiq. His use of it was the beginning of legal reform in Islamic law. To facilitate legal reform, 'Abduh employed the Islamic legal principle of al-maslahah al-mursalah. This principle was an application of ijtihad which he invoked in order to deal with issues such as polygamy and bank interest. 'Abduh's fatwas were based on the sources of Islamic law, i.e. the Qur'an and the Hadith. Although his main concern was to rehabilitate the use of reason in law, he never strayed far from the traditional sources.</description><creator>Taizir, Aswita</creator><contributor>Hallaq, Wael B.

This concern leads him to write his Muqaddima fi Usul al-Tafsir (An Introduction to Principles of Qur'anic Interpretation) which this thesis focuses on. In his principles, Ibn Taymiyya lays strong emphasis on the tafsir bi al-ma'thur and the authority of the salaf (the Companions of the Prophet and their Followers), adducing many new arguments in support of this position. He believes that the Qur'an had been explained in its entirety by the Prophet to his Companions, and the latter passed this understanding on to the tabi'un. This view leads him to rationalize claiming that the salaf's sayings always can be explained, and to oppose the use of reason in determining the meaning of the scripture. Ibn Taymiyya did not leave behind a complete commentary on the Qur'an. However, his principles of tafsir not only show much originality, they have also been very influential. In fact, his influence in this respect is not limited to medieval thinkers like Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya, Ibn Kathir, al-Zarkashi and al-Suyuti but extends to modern writers as well.</description><creator>Syafruddin, Didin</creator><contributor>Boullata, T.

Each student was required to complete the rock wall and ropes course circuit which consisted of 12 climbing related segments. Results revealed that the mean heart rate intensity for the entire circuit was 80.6% over a mean duration of 36 minutes 20 seconds.

In particular, this work attempts to critically examine the notion of essentialism, the resistance to accepting a feminine "essence," and the loosely defined and employed terminology surrounding this field of inquiry. In accomplishing these objectives I draw upon, and critique, the more recent work elaborated around theorizing with/through the "body." Aspects of feminist theory which are examined as contributive towards the above aim are an analysis of the explicit, and implicit, dangers of accepting or discarding essentialism, and an analysis of the inherent ontological and philosophical tenets that function within this present discourse. It is maintained that by addressing the issue of essentialism, the relationship between subjectivity, identity, and gender, within feminist theory, will be liberated from further constraining propositions.</description><creator>Snider, Kathryn</creator><contributor>Nemiroff, Stanley (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Feminist theory -- North America</subject><subject>Femininity (Philosophy)</subject><subject>Essence (Philosophy)</subject><title>From real essences to the feminine imaginary : critiques of essentialism in feminist theory in North America in the 1980's</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kp78gj464.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tt44pq06w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Religion and Philosophy in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k0698952f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:08:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Women have been healers since the dawn of humankind. They had learned their medical skills in a natural way since, as child bearers, they were also the first midwives, nurses, health carers, apothecaries and physicians. That women were skilled in the practice of medicine and that female healers were an accepted part in medieval medical practice is evident from the numerous references describing medical treatment as found in the courtly Middle High German romances. In this study, I will first offer an overview of the medical knowledge and practice of the Middle Ages. Then I will present literary examples and incidences portraying women as healers as described in the German courtly romances of Tristan by Gottfried von Stra$ beta$burg, Erec and Iwein by Hartmann von Aue, and Parzival and Willehalm by Wolfram von Eschenbach, in order to elucidate and complete the image of the medieval female healer. At the time when these romances were created, medical knowledge and practice were greatly influenced by the transmission and reception of Greek &amp; Arabic medical works which formed the basis of a new Latin medical learning. This in turn provided the basis for a growing vernacular European medical literature. On the one hand, medical practice was still based on traditional folk medicine with the female healers preparing and using simple herbal remedies; on the other hand, they resorted to exotic compound medicines, such as theriac, which was closer to the learned book medicine.</description><creator>Simon, Mary</creator><contributor>Richter, Horst (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Women healers</subject><subject>German literature -- Middle High German, 1050-1500 -- History and criticism.</subject><title>"...wurze und aller crûte craft und arzâtlîche meisterschaft..." : zur Darstellung der heilkundigen Frauen in den mittelhochdeutschen hüfischen Epen</title><language>ger</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fb494b36x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k0698952f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of German Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ks65hf186</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:08:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this investigation was to examine the tenability of three research assumptions. The first assumption is that Person-Thing Orientation and Introversion-Extraversion are synonymous traits. The second assumption is that Science populations, especially Physical Science populations, are less oriented to people and more oriented to things than are Social Science populations. The third assumption is that Science populations, particularly Physical Science populations, are more introverted than are Social Science populations. These three assumptions were tested using Pure and Applied Science, Health Science, and Social Science-Commerce junior college (CEGEP) students. Measures of Person-Thing Orientation and Introversion-Extraversion were employed. the Person-Thing Orientation measure was constructed and validated by the present author. The Introversion-Extraversion measure came from the Goldberg (1992) 100 Adjective Checklist. Results indicated that Person-Thing Orientation and Introversion-Extraversion appeared to be independent rather than synonymous traits. Also, Pure and Applied Science, Health Science, and Social Science-Commerce students could not be differentiated on the variable of Person-Thing Orientation. These student groups were differentiated on Introversion-Extraversion, but not in the predicted manner.

It is an exploration of the domestic determinants of foreign policy behaviour, and the relation between foreign policy behaviour and regime consolidation, legitimation, and survival in small, weak state actors located in a permeable regional system. The study advances an hypothesis of four explanatory variables to explain the success and failure of Hussein and Shihab's respective strategies. Husseinism's 'success'--as opposed to Shihabism's 'failure'--may be explained by a successful insulatory regional policy, the historical process of state formation, the availability of economic resources under state control, and the ability of the state to use its coercive resources without hindrance. This enabled the Hashemite regime to restructure state-society relations to consolidate social control, mitigate the effects of trans-national ideologies on the domestic arena, and achieve an acceptable level of national integration among the different segments of the society gaining the state allegiance from a sizeable number, or from strategic sectors, of the population.</description><creator>Salloukh, Bassel Fawzi</creator><contributor>Brynen, Rex (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Jordan -- Politics and government</subject><subject>Lebanon -- Politics and government -- 1946-</subject><title>The king and the general : survival strategies in Jordan and Lebanon</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dz010s15v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4b29b807k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2514nn39g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:08:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Two dual task experiments were conducted to determine the function and content of working memory in concept attainment. Levine's (1966) concept attainment paradigm was used as the primary task. The secondary task in each experiment made selective demands on one of two working memory components, either the phonological loop or the central executive. The effect of the secondary tasks on the performance on the Levine task was measured by frequency of hypothesis use, consistency of hypotheses with previous feedback, and strategies employed to manage feedback. These measures revealed that the two working memory components play different roles in concept attainment. The phonological loop is responsible for maintaining hypotheses, while the central executive carries out mental operations that enable the use of hypotheses that are logically consistent with the given feedback. These findings make it possible to provide a detailed account of the role of working memory in concept attainment and yield new insights into the concept attainment process.</description><creator>Sadesky, Gregory S.
