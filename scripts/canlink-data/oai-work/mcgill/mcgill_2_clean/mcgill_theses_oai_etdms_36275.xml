The dominance of Protestant puritanism in English Canadian culture is a frequent theme in the literature of the nation. In his writing, Robertson Davies counters the repressive dynamics of a society shaped by puritanism with an appeal to an alternate vision. This vision, which places greater value on self-knowledge, bears a strong affinity to the precepts of the ancient gnostics. Davies' critique of an English Canadian context which appears to place higher value on morality than on spiritual adventures can be compared to the gnostic rejection of the material world in favour of knowledge of the inner self in relation to the divine. The commitment to gnosis as a means of escape from a repressive environment to one of spiritual freedom is another mark of the connection between Davies' novels and the gnostic spirit. The presence of revealer figures who initiate their hearers into the way of gnosis is found in both the writings of the ancient gnostics and in the novels of Robertson Davies. Davies' treatment of the concepts of dualism, the nature of evil and human destiny bears a closer relationship to the ideas found in gnostic literature than to the doctrines of Judeo-Christian orthodoxy. Finally, Davies' emphasis on the importance of the individual in the quest for self-knowledge reflects a gnostic suspicion of communal values. The identification of the relationship between Davies' writing and the spirit of gnosticism provides a good case study of the way in which theological notions influence and are influenced by a particular cultural context.</description><creator>Thorpe, Brian</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Gnosticism in literature.</subject><subject>Davies, Robertson, 1913-1995 -- Religion</subject><title>Discerning the contemporary gnostic spirit in the novels of Robertson Davies.</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3f462615f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gh93h0195</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Religious Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hd76s086f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In the area of mass communications and media sociology, connections between theoretical claims and empirical evidence have often been tenuous. Using American national Election Study data gathered by the Center for Political Studies, this dissertation tests a series of hypotheses about the political impact of the mass media. The work profiles the news audience, and examines the public's reliance upon television and newspapers as sources of political information. Next, evidence is brought to bear upon the set of pessimistic assumptions that television news personnel hold about the tastes and capacities of the news audience. Finally, a crucial test is developed in order to evaluate five competing and contradictory hypotheses, all attempting to explain the relationships between the consumption of political materials through the mass media, political interest, and political participation. Of the previously untested claims assessed in the thesis, few were supported by the evidence gathered in research.</description><creator>Withers, Edward John</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Mass media -- Political aspects</subject><subject>Mass media -- Research</subject><title>The political impact of the mass media : theory and research in media sociology</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jq085k84h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hd76s086f</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Sociology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3t945r425</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis looks at the problems arising out of the unauthorized publication of the likeness of an individual resulting in the infringement of the individual's privacy or misrepresentation or exploitation of his or her personality. We have studied how the law of Quebec, France and the United Kingdom have dealt with each of these situations. We have also described the role of press councils in Quebec and the United Kingdom and examined the solutions proposed by these councils. The first part of the thesis deals with the basis in law for the protection of the human likeness, while the second part attempts to determine how effectively individuals are protected from the publication of their likeness. A comparison of the various solutions provided under the laws being examined has enabled us to determine whether one of them best safeguards the individual from the unauthorized publication of his or her likeness.</description><creator>Potvin, Louise, 1951-</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Law.</subject><title>La personne et la protection de son image : etude comparée des droits québécois, français et de la common law canadienne</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pv63g087q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3t945r425</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:37720d46p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is the analysis of Annex 18 to the Chicago convention on the Safe Carriage by Air of Dangerous Goods.

The focus of the research was on effects of different degrees of subjects' theoretical knowledge in the domain of biochemistry on their comprehension of written technical materials describing experimental procedures and results, and the ability to integrate such new text derived information with prior theoretical knowledge considered by experts to be relevant to the topic. Effects of cues on the accessibility and use of prior knowledge were also examined. Pre-test questions testing the extent of subjects' prior knowledge of photosynthesis, and a "cue article" specifically designed to prime subjects' relevant prior knowledge of photosynthesis, served as cues in the study. A theoretical model of experts' knowledge was developed from a semantic analysis of expert-produced texts. This "expert model" was used to evaluate the extent of students' theoretical knowledge of photosynthesis, and its accessibility while applying it to the experimental tasks. College students and university graduate students served as subjects in the study, permitting a contrast of groups varying in prior knowledge of and expertise in chemistry. Statistical analyses of data obtained from coding subjects' verbal protocols against text propositions and the expert model revealed that prior knowledge and comprehension contribute significantly to predicting knowledge integration, but they are not sufficient for this process to take place. It appears that qualitative aspects and specific characteristics of subjects' knowledge structure contribute to the process of integration, not simply the amount of accumulated knowledge. There was also evidence that there are specific inferential processes unique to knowledge integration that differentiate it from test comprehension. Cues manifested their effects on performance on comprehension tasks and integrative tasks only through their interactions with other factors. Furthermore, it was found that textual complexity placed specific constraints on students' performance: the application of textual information to the integrative tasks and students' ability to build conceptual frame representations based on text propositions depended on the complexity of the textual material.

Toward this end, the dissertation is divided into five major sections which link such forms of body movement and display to wider socio-historical movements of theory and practice; sexuality; commerce; pleasure and power; and culture. It is then concluded that such small-scale or "stripped-down" studies following this model may advance critical understanding of human bodies and subjects in cultural theory and practice, by situating non-mechanistic notions of communication, culture and dance within detailed investigations that emphasize the complexity and specificity of the practice of everyday life.</description><creator>Bloom, Michael</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Striptease</subject><subject>Stripteasers</subject><title>The bawdy politic : strips of culture and the culture of strip</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gf06g339f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/474299869</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Graduate Communications Program</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3n203z80v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis I investigate the crucial role played by government in phonology in explaining various processes such as epenthesis, vowel deletion, vowel harmony, consonant assimilation, as well as the syllabification of skeletal points along with their segments into constituents, and the organization of these constituents in the word. It is argued that all these phonological processes are determined by governing relations units contract with each other. Given that government applies in phonology defining the constraints under which it operates is an integral part of such a research program. The aim of this thesis then, is to analyze different phonological processes in terms of government and to determine what the relevant constraints are. The processes that are considered involve governing relations between nuclei that are adjacent at the level of nuclear projection. I show that in considering branching constituents as governing domains, government within such domains is subject to a special constraint, viz. the Minimality Condition that has been proposed by Chomsky (1986). In addition I demonstrate that only the immediate projection of a given head counts as a barrier to government from the outside. Another proposal of this thesis concerns the treatment of the alternations between schwa and zero in French in terms of a relation of proper government. From such a perspective, I show that an empty nucleus is realized as zero when it is properly governed by a following nucleus. Proper government is a stronger case of government and is subject to certain additional conditions. Among them are the following: the proper governor must have phonetic content and subject to parametric variation, it can only properly govern one empty governee.</description><creator>Charette, Monik</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Grammar, Comparative and general -- Phonology</subject><subject>Government (Grammar)</subject><title>Some constraints on governing relations in phonology</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vh53ww47k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3n203z80v</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Linguistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gb19f652r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A new approach to the ribosyl-ribitol unit of the capsular polysaccharide of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) was developed.

The first three experiments examined whether excision of this region (1) slows the rate at which verbal material is processed, (2) reduces working-memory capacity, or (3) interferes with the integration of information across sentences. Left temporal lobectomy does not impair these aspects of the initial processing of stories, since on none of the above variables was the performance of left temporal-lobe groups deficient relative to that of normal control subjects, or patients with unilateral frontal- or right temporal-lobe removals. The fourth experiment examined the effect of left temporal lobectomy on how quickly a passage was forgotten after it had been learned to criterion. Although patients with such an excision took more trials to learn a story than did normal control subjects, only those patients with extensive left hippocampal removal were impaired when recalling this story 20 minutes later. These results highlight the role of the left hippocampus in the long-term maintenance of story information.</description><creator>Frisk, Virginia</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Temporal lobes -- Research.</subject><subject>Memory disorders -- Research.</subject><subject>Memory -- Research.</subject><title>Comprehension and recall of stories following left temporal lobectomy</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xd07gt34x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5138jf445</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gx41mj72j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Using a barotropic model, some aspects of the theory of multiple equilibria were investigated, namely, the genesis of multiple equilibria via bent resonance, and the properties of some of the linearly unstable low index solutions. These studies were conducted using numerical models with a truncated spectral representation of the dependent variables, truncation that was determined in terms of its capacity to allow for nonlinear interactions. By means of a continuation algorithm, the stationary solutions of the potential vorticity equation were calculated for a number of regions of parameter space, allowing us to study the dependence of the steady solutions on an ensemble of parameters, including the geometry of the domain. We can conclude that it is possible to observe the presence of more than one stable stationary solution for certain restricted regions of parameter space, but that in a majority of situations, only one solution is linearly stable. The latter, however, is not the only stable regime present since the unstable solution with the lowest zonal index is then surrounded by a stable periodic solution also of a low index type.</description><creator>Gravel, Sylvie</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</subject><title>Periodic and stationary solutions to a forced-dissipated barotropic model of the atmosphere</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3j3332901.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gx41mj72j</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Meteorology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:79407x95m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Testing VLSI circuits is a complex task that requires enormous amounts of resources. To decrease testing costs, testing issues are considered earlier in the design process. This is known as "design for testability" (DFT). Built-in Self Test (BIST) is one proposed DFT approach. BIST generally consists of incorporating additional circuitry on the chip to generate test patterns and compact the response of the circuit under test (CUT) into a reference signature. Compaction implies an information loss, introducing the possibility that a faulty circuit declares itself as good. Such errors are known as aliasing errors. Several BIST schemes have been proposed, and each have a particular performance in regard to aliasing. However, the schemes are often evaluated and compared with ill-defined measures for which the underlying assumptions are either not stated or understood clearly. Here, a novel classification for the measures of aliasing is proposed. By providing clear definitions of different possible measures, the proposed classification augments the understanding of the aliasing problem. This dissertation focuses on the popular BIST scheme that consists of applying pseudorandom test patterns to a CUT and compacting the latter's response by a signature analysis register (LFSR). Assessing the quality of such a scheme in regard to fault coverage is crucial. Fault coverage can be established by full fault simulation. However, high costs may preclude this approach. Other techniques, probabilistic in nature, have been proposed, but a lack of computationally feasible techniques for analyzing the aliasing problem under a reasonable model has left them elusive. Here, new and computationally feasible techniques are developed. More specifically, closed-form expressions for the probability of aliasing are derived for a certain type of LFSRs. Upper bounds are derived for LFSRs characterized by primitive polynomials. An iterative technique is developed for computing the exact probability of aliasing for LFSRs characterized by any feedback polynomial, and for any test sequence length. These new techniques enable better assessments of the quality of BIST schemes that use signature analysis for response compaction. In turn, they are useful for making important design decisions, e.g., determining the number of test patterns that should be applied to a CUT to achieve a certain test confidence; alternatively, deciding how long the signature analyzer should be, and what type of feedback it should possess to achieve a certain desired test confidence. The techniques developed for computing the probability of aliasing in BIST are also useful in the context of coding theory. The iterative technique developed for computing the probability of aliasing may be used as an efficient technique for computing the probability of an undetected error for shortened versions of cyclic codes.</description><creator>Ivanov, André</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>BIST signature analysis : analytical techniques for computing the probability of aliasing</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ng451j20p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/79407x95m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jw827c440</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The main objective of this research is to develop new unbiased plotting position formulas for two general probability distributions which are widely used in hydrologic frequency analyses: the Pearson type III (P3) and the General Extreme Value (GEV) distributions. The research study is divided into three parts. First, using the Probability Weighted Moment (PWM) theory an analytical method is proposed to derive the exact plotting positions for systematic flood records (i.e., complete flood samples which occurred during the period of systematic gauging). Second, for the convenience of practical application, simple unbiased plotting position formulas representing a very reliable approximation to the exact plotting positions are developed. Third, new unbiased plotting position formulas for P3 and GEV distributions are proposed for historical flood records (i.e., data on very large floods which occurred outside or within the systematic gauging period). The incorporation of historical flood information in plotting position formulas would significantly improve the estimation of flood quantiles. The analytical method and plotting position formulas proposed in the present study are verified and compared with various existing techniques and formulas. The suggested analytical method was found to be preferable to the conventional direct numerical integration and the Monte Carlo simulation procedure in the estimation of expected values of P3 and GEV order statistics. Results of the numerical and graphical comparisons have also demonstrated that the plotting position formulas developed in this study provided a better agreement to the exact plotting positions than several existing formulas. In particular, the suggested formulas are more flexible because they can take explicitly into account the skewness coefficient of the underlying distribution. Moreover, for illustration purposes, the proposed formulas were applied to observed flow data of various rivers. It was found that the proposed formulas provided better estimates of flood quantiles than many existing formulas including the well-known Weibull formula. Finally, special probability papers for various skewness values are developed for the P3 and GEV distributions. It can be concluded that the development of new plotting position formulas and probability papers for the P3 and GEV distributions in the present study has provided a convenient and practical tool for the application of these distributions in engineering practice.</description><creator>In-Na, Nophadal</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Engineering, Civil.</subject><title>New plotting position formulas for some well-known distributions in engineering hydrology</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7s75dd101.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jw827c440</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kd17ct655</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Local heat transfer profiles under a confined inclined slot jet discharging from a sharp-edged re-entry straight channel nozzle with various inclinations were measured. Average heat transfer was determined by integrating local profiles between positions of equal local Nusselt number. In the absence of significant heat transfer surface motion, impingement heat transfer expressed as stagnation and average Nusselt number with the present nozzles set either normal or 15$ sp circ$ from normal, is similar to that with ASME standard contoured entry nozzles at a nozzle-to-surface spacing of 6 nozzle widths. As this spacing is reduced by one-half, heat transfer becomes much larger for the re-entry channel nozzles, by 100% for average Nusselt number, by 250% for stagnation Nusselt number under the conditions tested. For an impingement surface moving at high speed, highest heat transfer is obtained with the nozzle set at inclinations between normal and 15$ sp circ$ with the jet opposing the impingement surface motion. Use of jets in the aiding flow orientation result in large drops in heat transfer rate, as does the use of opposing jets inclined at angles large than 15$ sp circ$ from normal. The same large advantage of the re-entry straight channel nozzle over the ASME standard contoured entry nozzle applies for impingement surface moving at high speeds as in the absence of surface motion. The importance of asymmetric exhaust port location is documented for the case of inclined slot jets impinging on moving or stationary impingement surface, and for normal slot jets impinging on high speed heat transfer surfaces.</description><creator>Huang, Bing</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Heat transfer under an inclined slot jet impinging on a moving surface</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7h149q53v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kd17ct655</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gx41mj73t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Light emission in marine bacteria is under the control of growth dependent induction. Associated with the induction is the increase in synthesis of the components of the two enzymes which catalyze the light emitting reaction, luciferase and fatty acid reductase. Large DNA fragments from three marine bacteria Vibrio fischeri, Vibrio harveyi and Photobacterium phosphoreum, were isolated from genomic libraries of these strains. Escherichia coli, harboring a recombinant plasmid containing a 16 kbp fragment of V. fischeri DNA, were found to express growth dependent luminescence. E. coli clones harboring analogous sequences of V. harveyi or P. phosphoreum lux DNA only expressed a low constitutive level of light which was dependent on the presence of aldehyde in the growth media. Cell extracts of E. coli expressing the lux genes from V. fischeri contained a fatty acid reductase activity analogous to the activity first identified in P. phosphoreum. This result showed that the genes for luciferase and fatty acid reductase were linked inV. fischeri. By differential acylation of the fatty acid reductase subunits in extracts of V. fischeri and the E. coli clone, the products of the luxC, luxD and luxE genes of V. fischeri were identified as the reductase, transferase and synthetase components, respectively. In addition, the lux genes from a fatty acid stimulatible dark mutant of V. harveyi were cloned and it was demonstrated that the luxD gene from this mutant synthesized a non-functional transferase polypeptide. The lux structural genes are coordinately expressed to different levels during induction of luminescence. The lux polypeptides of V. fischeri were shown to be differentially synthesized when expressed under the control of a T7 promoter in E. coli. This result indicated that postranscriptional events were regulating the differential expression of the lux genes. A set of overlapping transcripts encoding the lux genes were shown to be induced during luminescence induction, suggesting that segmental differences in mRNA stability may be related to differential expression of the lux genes. The luxA and luxB genes of V. harveyi encoding the alpha and beta subunits of luciferase, respectively, were fused by site-directed mutagenesis. This fused gene synthesized a monocistronic luxAB mRNA capable of programming the synthesis of a functional single subunit luciferase enzyme in E. coli, in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This fused gene has potential applicability for studying gene expression in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems.</description><creator>Boylan, Michael Owen</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><title>Cloning and expression of the genes responsible for luminescence in marine bacteria</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pg15bf64d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gx41mj73t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4m90dw22s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The first comprehensive set of measurements is obtained for rates of through drying paper with all drying conditions measured and controlled. Complete pressure drop-drying rate curves are determined for 235 handsheets of kraft paper of basis weights 25-150g/m$ sp{ rm 2}$ dried in air over a wide range of temperatures and throughflow rates. The previous procedure of calculating permeability by Darcy's law is substantially in error at relevant throughflow rates. A new characteristic dimension for flow through both dry and moist paper is determined by application of fundamental momentum transport principles. During through drying the value of the d$ sb{ rm p}$ drops substantially from an upper to a lower asymptotic limit, shown to correspond to known water-fibre relations. A theoretically based Re-f-d$ sb{ rm p}$ treatment is shown to be a more powerful method than those used previously. A comprehensive, tested correlation for through drying rates in the constant rate period is reported. Through drying is demonstrated to start with an increasing rate period during which, for industrial conditions, about half the water is removed. An original treatment, "drying period diagrams", shows the extent of the increasing, constant and falling rate periods as a function of drying conditions. The concept of an increasing-constant-falling rate triple point, X$ sb{ rm ICF}$, shows that typically there will be no constant rate period for industrial conditions of through drying light weight paper of low moisture content. Sherwood number is calculated for the constant rate period of drying using the characteristic dimension and interfacial transfer area for moist paper determined by momentum transfer analysis. Sherwood number is related to drying conditions and to transport phenomena within the sheet. Through drying rates are successfully predicted by a model which treats the process as three drying periods, i.e. increasing, constant and falling rate, with a variable specific surface of paper.</description><creator>Polat, Osman</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Through drying of paper</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pc289j71k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4m90dw22s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qj72p783g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In mice, the trait of natural resistance and susceptibility to Mycobacterium bovis (strain BCG Montreal) infection is controlled by the Bcg gene. The two alleles of the Bcg gene, termed $Bcg sp{ rm r}$ (resistant) and $Bcg sp{ rm s}$ (susceptible), are expressed by host macrophages as an innate ability to restrict the multiplication of BCG bacteria. In the present study, a regulatory effect of the Bcg gene was established on the host immune response to BCG infection. An indirect effect of the Bcg gene on lymphocyte proliferation in vitro was observed in inbred strains expressing $Bcg sp{ rm s}$ and $Bcg sp{ rm r}$ genotypes. The degree of antigen specific proliferation in vitro was found to be dependent on the extent of BCG growth in vivo following infection. Evidence for a second effect of the Bcg gene was observed in vitro and in vivo when immunity was examined in Bcg congenic mice on the BALB/c background. Genetically resistant mice exhibited protective immunity and T cell responses by 3 weeks post BCG infection. In susceptible animals, the onset of protective immunity was protracted and antigen specific T cell responses were absent. By 6 weeks following BCG infection, T cell responses and protective immunity were demonstrable in both strains. As a mechanism to explain the early deficit of T cell activation in $Bcg sp{ rm s}$ animals, macrophage Class II Ia expression was analyzed. Splenic macrophages isolated from $Bcg sp{ rm r}$ animals contained more Ia$ sp+$ cells before and after BCG infection than $Bcg sp{ rm s}$ animals. The antigen presenting function of $Bcg sp{ rm r}$, but not $Bcg sp{ rm s}$, splenic macrophages was found to be increased following infection. Thus, it was concluded that the differential capacity of $Bcg sp{ rm r}$ and $Bcg sp{ rm s}$ mice to generate T cell immunity resulted from a difference in the number of Ia$ sp+$ antigen presenting macrophages.</description><creator>Buschman, Ellen</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><title>Immunological consequences of the Bcg gene</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p2676w277.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qj72p783g</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6t053g80w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The lack of axonal regeneration in the adult mammalian CNS has been correlated with the apparent inability of these neurons to increase their expression of the growth associated protein, GAP-43 in response to injury. Here are reported studies of the expression of GAP-43, in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) of the adult rat whose axons were cut at different distances along the optic nerve or cut immediately behind the eye and allowed to regenerate along peripheral nerve grafts. The immunocytochemical and axonal transport studies demonstrate that injured and regenerating RGCs synthesize and transport increased levels of GAP-43. The enhanced GAP-43 immunoreactivity and transport is triggered by axonal injury and the heightened transport of GAP-43 follows a time course which is influenced by axonal growth. The increased expression of GAP-43 and axonal regeneration into peripheral nerve grafts occur predominantly when axons are cut near their cell bodies suggesting that enhanced GAP-43 expression may be involved in the regulation of neuronal response required for axonal regrowth.</description><creator>Lozano, Andres M.</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>The expression of the growth associated protein GAP-43 in injured and regenerating retinal ganglion cells of the adult rat /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jm214p78v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6t053g80w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3j3332919</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Seventy-five workers exposed to styrene in four reinforced plastics plants in the Montreal area have taken part in this study. All subjects were tested for peripheral nervous system functioning during a period of continuous exposure; 12 were re-evaluated after a lay-off period without exposure. During the period of continuous exposure, a dose-response relationship between the environmental exposure and the sensory nerve conduction velocity (NCV) was demonstrated. Almost all workers exposed for at least one month to levels of styrene above 100 ppm had a nerve conduction deficit. The effects observed were not related to cumulated exposure. After a period of lay-off, slight changes in NCV were observed in accordance with a functional improvement. No excess in symptoms reported in relation to a NCV deficit was demonstrated. Biological measures of styrene absorption and excretion were used; they appeared to be better predictors of neurotoxic effects than environmental measures of styrene exposure.</description><creator>Gautrin, Denyse</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</subject><title>Les effets neurotoxiques de l'exposition professionnelle au styrène et leur réversibilité /</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bv73c1166.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3j3332919</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:dr26xx99v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The complexity of modern robotic workcells, consisting of many cooperating elements (eg. robots, sensing systems) makes programming applications enormously difficult. Programming such a complex robotic system is a complicated task that requires thorough understanding of each of its elements. Thus far, little has been done in the way of developing a robotic workcell programming environment: this dissertation addresses this very problem. A hierarchical framework is proposed that decomposes the problem into three sub-problems, (i) the Planning sub-problem, addressed by the Strategy level, which determines what has to be done in terms of 'steps' that have to be performed, decides which active element will perform each of those 'steps' and determines the layout of the workcell, (ii) the Coordination sub-problem, addressed by the Tactics level which determines when a 'step' can be executed, and (iii) the Command sub-problem, addressed by the Virtual Device level, which determines how each of the 'steps' is executed. In particular, we will focus on the Coordination and Command sub-problems addressed by the run-time control environment. We will define a state formalism and based on it we will build a model of the intended workcell behavior. A prototype implementation of the proposed run-time control and programming environment, called WRAP (Workcell ReAl-time Programming) is described. An idealized assembly task was programmed to evaluate the approach and an evaluation of these experimental results is presented.</description><creator>Carayannis, Gregory</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>A generic run-time environment for a robotic workcell /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2b88qc85w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dr26xx99v</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3484zh494</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:58:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The effect of planting date on yield was studied in Parana State, Brazil where five tropical hybrids of maize were planted at 14 planting dates over three growing seasons at five locations. Soil water holding characteristics and meteorological variables were measured at each location. The water release curve for each soil was determined, using a power function. Corn heat units were calculated and used to measure the phenological development of each hybrid. This information, along with meteorological data, was used in a mathematical model to simulate plant growth over each growing period. Meteorological data from 1976 to 1986 were employed to simulate yield data for 14 planting dates during each growing season at four locations for each hybrid. The average production curve for the 10 growing seasons was compared to the curve observed for the 1986/87 growing season for three of the five hybrids. Thermal requirements appeared as an efficient tool to predict corn developmental stages, and the power function fit satisfactorily the observed soil data. The predicted curve, representing a 10-year average, showed that the designed model accounted for the major cultural and environmental factors that affect yield at each location, being sensitive enough to detect differences among genotypes. Comparisons between predicted and observed curves showed that they had the same shape.</description><creator>Gomes, Jose</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Corn -- Brazil -- Planting time.</subject><title>Selection of planting date for maize in Parana State, Brazil</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tt44pn59h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3484zh494</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Plant Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xk81jm07g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:58:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A theoretical and experimental study is presented of texture evolution in hcp zirconium deformed at high temperatures. It is shown that, within the temperature range in which nuclear components are fabricated, the development of crystallographic texture is controlled by the simultaneous activation of $ langle$a$ rangle$ and $ langle$c + a$ rangle$ slip. This is demonstrated by experiments on Zr-2.5 Nb and unalloyed Zr deformed along three of the four elementary strain paths: axisymmetric elongation and compression and pure shear. Further experimental work on the axisymmetric deformation of unalloyed Zr and Zr-20 Nb shows that the influence of the bcc $ beta$-Zr phase present in Zr-2.5 Nb at the temperatures of interest is not due to the formation of crystallographic textures in this phase. Texture evolution modelling was implemented for the case of polycrystalline hcp metals by making use of the duality principle between the generalized Taylor and Bishop-Hill theories of polycrystal plasticity and with the help of linear programming. The high temperature experimental textures for the three elementary strain paths mentioned above were successfully predicted using the relaxed constraint theory. It is shown that, for the cases of pure shear and compression, the so-called pancake version of this approach gives a better approximation to the observed textures than the full constraint calculations. For axisymmetric elongation, the curling version of the relaxed constraint model gives the best results. By the analysis of slip activity maps, it is shown that the limitations of the full constraint model reside in the high activity level for $ langle$c + a$ rangle$ slip associated with this approach. When the relaxed constraint model is applied, the activity level of $ langle$c + a$ rangle$ slip is considerably reduced, leading to much better agreement of the predicted textures with the experimental results. The full constraint model is also applied to simulate texture evolution in $ alpha$-Zr deformed in simple shear at room temperature. It is demonstrated that the level of agreement is at least as good as that obtained when full constraint calculations were carried out. Finally, a high temperature texture rosette is proposed for prediction of the textures developed during tube forming operations for Zr alloy nuclear components.

When the supercritical shear $ delta$ is such that 0 $&lt;$ $ delta$ $ ll$ 1 and the initial conditions are sufficiently small, finite amplitude equilibration occurs even though the potential vorticity field in the bottom layer Q(X,Y,t) remains transient, the potential enstrophy being transferred to smaller and smaller scales. It is shown that the inviscid equilibrium amplitude of the unstable wave is larger by a factor of $ surd$2 than the one found by Pedlosky (1982-b) in the limit of small dissipation. This indicates that the limits t $ to$ $ infty$ and r $ to$ 0 are not interchangeable. Inviscid equilibration occurs when the mixing in the lowest layer results in the streamwise homogenization of the coarse-grained average (Q) of the potential vorticity which means that (Q) $ to$ f($ psi$), $ psi$ being the streamfunction. When $ delta$ and the initial conditions are equally important, depending on the nature of the latter, periodic solutions and finite equilibration are both possible. An example is given of a periodic case when $ delta$ = 0. The potential vorticity field then reversibly wraps and un-wraps around the streamlines and mixing does not occur. Finally, these exact solutions are used to judge the reliability of numerical results obtained from truncated spectral models. For cases where finite equilibration occurs, the resolution of a truncated model is only adequate for a finite period of time while for periodic cases, a model with sufficient resolution can represent correctly the exact solution for any length of time.</description><creator>Gauthier, Pierre.</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</subject><title>Développement de tourbillons baroclines marginalement instables</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sn009z50n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5h73pw76h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Meteorology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:dz010q75w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:58:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis focuses upon the algorithms of the so-called conservative methodology for distributed discrete-event simulation. In the first approach, a network of fully distributed processes, and severely restricted memory are assumed. In this environment, a look-ahead, deadlock-breaking algorithm called Pseudosimulation, is developed. A lower bound on memory requirements for distributed simulation is established. In the second approach, a scenario where several processes are mapped to the same processor is investigated. The Time-of-Next-Event algorithm, created for this purpose, computes the greatest lower bound of time stamps of the events to arrive at all empty inter-process links located in the same processor. It is shown that this algorithm has the same computational complexity as the solution of the shortest path problem. Furthermore, a distributed deadlock-breaking algorithm is introduced and proven correct. In order to increase the efficiency of the second approach, and to reduce the deadlock probability, a clustering algorithm for the assignment of processes to processors is developed. Finally, a heuristic solution to control the inflow of newly generated events and to schedule processes is proposed.</description><creator>Grošelj, Bojan</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Pseudosimulation and the distributed simulation of clustered processes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t435gd61q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dz010q75w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):36300</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
