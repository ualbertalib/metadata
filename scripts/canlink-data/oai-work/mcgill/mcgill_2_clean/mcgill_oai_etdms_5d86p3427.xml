The possibility of restoring flow to the ischemic area as soon as possible after occlusion by means of aortocoronary bypass surgery has been suggested. The theoretical basis for such a procedure rests on the histologically demonstrated zone of reversible ischemia persisting around an infarct after permanent necrosis has occurred in the center. This study was designed to investigate the functional significance of this peripheral zone of temporary ischemia and to define the critical time within which blood flow would have to be restored. Ventricular function, myocardial contractility and histologic changes were studied in fifty cats divided into five groups: no occlusion (sham operation), permanent ligation, and thirty minutes, two hours and four hours of temporary ischemia. Measurements were made before, during, immediately after, and six weeks after occlusion of the anterior descending coronary artery. The results indicate that restoration of flow could indeed significantly improve ventricular function and reduce infarct size if performed early enough. In our model the time available to restore flow is under four hours but this would vary in the individual patient with the status of the collateral circulation and other factors.</description><creator>Symes, James F.</creator><contributor>Blundell, P.
