It is therefore merely for historical comparison that we look further back than the 19th. century and maybe for moral lesson and inspiration. Ever since man has been bartering exchanging or buying goods he has set up market places as a common ground for this purpose either by proclamation of the lord of the land or by common agreement or both, or by custom.</description><creator>Leaning, John.
