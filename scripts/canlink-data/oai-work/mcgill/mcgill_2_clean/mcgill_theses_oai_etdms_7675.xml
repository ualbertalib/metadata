While some of this will undoubtedly eventually be used for manufacture, the time has not come for large areas to be used in this way. In the meantime are these lands to lie idle, and are the areas unsuited to industrial development to find no place in our Agriculture? Reclaimed peat soils are often quite valuable, particularly for certain crops. In districts near large commercial centers, where land is high priced, the development of new areas more difficult to handle is becoming practicable, and if means of reclaiming these deposits at a reduced cost are discovered, or of increasing their value as a crop producing medium found, a distinct forward step will have been taken. With the object of studying this particular peat, and getting if possible a little light on some of the problems in its reclamation, samples were taken from the deposit lying between the Nicomekl and Serpentine Rivers in Surrey Municipality.

At the outset my idea was to perfuse the spleen with a solution of Ringer's, in which were minutely divided foreign particles, and the materials used were insoluble India ink and insoluble Per Red R. imported by McArthur, Brown Company. As these experiments did not yield any information, other aspects were considered, such as intravitam injections, stimulation of the nerves to spleen, sectioning of the nerves and also removal of spleen. All work was performed on dogs and under anaesthesia. [...]</description><creator>Malcolm, Robert B.</creator><contributor>Tait, J. &amp; Macallum, A.

Such a weakening effect is generally allowed for by a reduction in the transverse net area. As modern specifications provide a great variety of methods for calculating this additional deduction, it is the purpose ofthis paper to compare some of the more representative methods in the light of actual tests. The results used for this comparison are taken from three separate investigations into the strength of builtup tension members. Among these will be found most of the types in common use for heavy oonstruction. [...]</description><creator>McLennan, Logan S.</creator><contributor>Roberts, A. &amp; Mackay, H.

Others plant thinly and claim that a good ear development is necessary if silage of a high nutritive value is to be obtained.

Since porous solids possess an extremely large surface, relative to their mass, one would expect this power to be developed to a high degree, and this is amply borne out by the observed facts. The original discovery of this phenomenon was made by Scheele and Fontana, independently, in 1777, and the selective nature of adsorption was at once recognized.
