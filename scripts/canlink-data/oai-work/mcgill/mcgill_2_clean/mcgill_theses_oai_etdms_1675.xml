One issue of importance is that an increase in the muscle-to-electrode distance (MEdist) acts as a low-pass filter, filtering out the high frequency components of the EMG power spectrum (the MEdist filter). Due to the numerous factors which can influence the EMGdi, control of signal quality is also of utmost importance. The aims of this study were: (1) to evaluate the effect of the MEdist filter on EMGdi, as measured with a multiple array esophageal electrode, (2) to take advantage of the MEdist filter in order to locate the position of the diaphragm with respect to the electrodes, and (3) to evaluate the influence of changes in chest wall configuration on EMGdi center frequency (CF) values, while controlling for both signal quality and the MEdist filter. Five normal male subjects performed static contractions of the diaphragm at seven predetermined chest wall configurations. The EMGdi was measured with an array of eight steel rings mounted on a catheter, forming seven sequential pairs of electrodes, with an interelectrode distance of 10 mm. EMGdi signal quality was evaluated by computer algorithms. The pair of electrodes whose EMGdi signals (and power spectrums) were the least influenced by the MEdist filter was assumed to be closest to the diaphragm. The results of the study indicated (1) EMGdi power spectrums and their associated CF values were strongly affected by the position of the diaphragm with respect to the multiple array esophageal electrode. CF decreased by approximately 1 Hz per mm displacement away from the diaphragm. (2) By controlling for the MEdist filter, there was no relationship found between changes in chest wall configuration and CF values. These data demonstrate that changes in chest wall configuration, and hence diaphragm length, do not influence the CF values of the EMGdi, if the distance between the electrodes and the diaphragm and signal quality are controlled for.</description><creator>Beck, Jennifer, 1968-</creator><contributor>Grassino, Alex (advisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><subject>Biophysics, Medical.</subject><title>Effects of chest wall configuration and electrode positioning on human diaphragmatic EMG</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pv63g2318.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z603r052b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physiology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k35696483</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:11:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>One way to reduce the complexity of the speech recognition is to use syntactic, semantic and pragmatic information to predict the next input of the user. In spoken dialogue systems pragmatic information can include knowledge about the dialogue domain, dialogue context and dialogue focus. This thesis describes a dialogue manager for a spoken database retrieval system. The main design objectives were to create a tool that would facilitate the design of human-computer dialogues and to provide a language model to the speech recognizer containing the predictions of the next utterance. The dialogue model is data driven and the dialogue manager is integrated into a generic dialogue system. The role of the dialogue manager is to control the interaction between the user and the computer. When the user queries the database, the dialogue manager analyzes the input and if necessary, obtains the information still needed to formulate a valid query to the database.</description><creator>Hermannsdóttir, Sigríður Helga</creator><contributor>Mori, Renato de (advisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>A dialogue manager for a spoken dialogue system</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qn59q629m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k35696483</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:707959793</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:11:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this study was to describe maternal fatigue during the first six weeks postpartum. Forty-eight healthy, primiparous mothers who experienced uncomplicated vaginal births in a large urban hospital were asked to complete the Maternal Piper Fatigue Scale during their hospital stay, and at two and six weeks postpartum. Fatigue intensity was relatively high at two days and two weeks, but had significantly declined to a relatively "normal" level by six weeks postpartum. However, 25% of the mothers were still reporting "severe" fatigue at six weeks. The contributing factors most frequently identified by the mothers were labour and delivery issues (2 days), sleep pattern disturbances, and infant care issues (2 &amp; 6 weeks). Rest, sleep, and instrumental support were consistently identified by mothers as helping alleviate their fatigue during the first six weeks postpartum.</description><creator>Webster, Barbara Anne</creator><contributor>Hanrahan, Caroline (advisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Health Sciences, Nursing.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Obstetrics and Gynecology.</subject><title>Maternal fatigue during the postpartum period</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Barbara Anne Webster, 1994</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xg94hr76v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/707959793</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Nursing</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2z10ws45p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:11:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Carboxypeptidase Y (E.C. 3.4.12.1) was produced from Kluyveromyces fragilis ATCC 28244. The maximum growth and enzyme production were obtained during 24 hr of growth at the late logarithmic phase with optimized conditions (25$ sp circ $C, 300 rpm, pH 5) using YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, w/v) broth medium. A Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) was used for the enzyme purification. The enzyme was purified to 216 fold over the crude extract with a recovery of 18%. The apparent molecular weight of the purified enzyme was estimated to be 120 kDa on Native-PAGE and 56 kDa on SDS-PAGE suggesting that carboxypeptidase Y from Kluyveromyces fragilis consists of two subunits. The pH and temperature optima of the enzyme were pH 6.0 and 35$ sp circ$C, respectively. The enzyme activity was strongly inhibited by diisopropylphosphofluoridate (DIPF) and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF), and caused an average 50% loss of activity when incubated with various metal cations. The apparent K$ sb{ rm m}$ and V$ sb{ rm max}$ values obtained for n-benzoyl-L-tyrosine-p-nitroanilide (BTPNA) and carboxybenzoxyphenylalanylalanine (Cbz-Phe-Ala) were 5.1 mM and 13.4 $ mu$mole/min/mg and 2.98 mM and 22.58 $ mu$mole/min/mg, respectively. Carboxypeptidase Y hydrolysis on the tryptic digests of $ alpha sb{ rm s1}$- and $ beta$-casein showed that the enzyme randomly removed five and three hydrophobic peptides, respectively and greatly reduced the size and heights of the other peptides analysed on Reversed Phase-High Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC).</description><creator>Transfiguracion, Julia de la Cruz</creator><contributor>Lee, Byong H.

Previous studies have shown that audiovisual speech perception in adults and older children is very influenced by the visual speech information but children under five are influenced by the auditory input almost exclusively (McGurk &amp; MacDonald, 1976; Massaro, 1984; and Massaro, Thompson, Barron, &amp; Laren, 1986). In this investigation 46 children aged between 4:7 and 12:4, and 15 adults were presented with conflicting audiovisual syllables made according to the McGurk paradigm. The results indicated that the influence of auditory information decreased with age, while the influence of visual information increased with age. In addition, an adult-like response pattern was observed in only half of the children in the oldest child subject group (10-12 years old) suggesting that the integration of auditory and visual speech information continues to develop beyond the age of twelve.</description><creator>Hockley, Neil Spencer</creator><contributor>Polka, Linda (advisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Speech perception in children.</subject><subject>Speech perception.</subject><title>The development of audiovisual speech perception</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j9602300r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jw827d756</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Communication Sciences and Disorders</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6969z308b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:11:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Deaf people who know and use American Sign Language, ASL, outperform normally hearing people on certain visuospatial tests. This enhanced visuospatial performance is interpreted as being the result of knowing and using a visual and spatial grammar. An alternative explanation is that this enhanced visuospatial performance is due to sensory compensation, that is, a heavy reliance on vision throughout development due to deafness. The present study tested this alternative explanation. Eight congenitally and profoundly deaf adults (4 women, 4 men) who did not know sign language and eight normally hearing controls (4 women, 4 men) were tested on four visuospatial tasks requiring mental rotation in two and three dimensions (Card Rotation, Paper Form Board, Space Relations and Spatial Visualization). Subjects were matched for age, sex, and education. Spatial solution strategy and handedness were also assessed. Results showed that both groups were significantly faster and more accurate on the two-dimensional tasks than on the three-dimensional tasks. Additionally, hearing women and deaf men were significantly faster than the deaf women over all tasks. The two groups used similar solution strategy for all tasks except Spatial Visualization, where more deaf subjects used a mental rotation strategy. These findings suggest that sensory compensation per se does not lead to enhanced visuospatial skill.</description><creator>Chamberlain, Charlene</creator><contributor>Mayberry, Rachel (advisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Health Sciences, General.</subject><subject>Psychology, General.</subject><title>Do the deaf "see" better? : effects of deafness on visuospatial skills</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9p290c64z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6969z308b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Communication Sciences and Disorders</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:73666677s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:11:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The hepatitis B virus X gene product, HBx, is a promiscuous viral activator and it stimulates transcription of both pol II and III promoters. HBx also interacts with tumour suppressor p53 protein. In vitro transcriptional studies using the human U6 pol III promoter, showed that addition of HBx after preinitiation complex formation resulted in a 3 to 8 fold increase of transcription, whereas addition of HBx prior to preinitiation complex formation resulted in repression. The two-fold repression observed in transient transfection analysis and the activation observed in vitro was dependent on the presence of an upstream octamer element. Furthermore, the incorporation of HBx into a stable U6 preinitiation complex was confirmed by employing high performance liquid chromatography on a 4000A methacrylate polymer, which permitted the purification of human U6 preinitiation complexes. This methodology was initially developed using the RNA polymerase III VA$ sb{ rm I}$ gene and allowed for a 10$ sp5$ fold enrichment in VA$ sb{ rm I}$ transcription preinitiation complexes. Additionally, transient transfection analysis in Calu-6 cells showed that HBx could inhibit the transactivation of the pol II p53 responsive TATA-box driven reporter plasmid. In vitro studies using the same reporter plasmid established that the addition of HBx prior to or after preinitiation complex formation resulted in the same two-fold inhibition. The work presented in this thesis demonstrates the ability of HBx to function as a corepressor or as a coactivator.</description><creator>Antunovic, Jovan</creator><contributor>Cromlish, J. A.

From an examination of the general problem and a survey of previous research, it appears that the central problem of numerical computational geometry is how to deal with degenerate and nearly degenerate input. For some applications, such as solid modeling, degeneracy is often intended but we cannot always ascertain its existence using finite precision. For other applications, degenerate input is unwanted but nearly degenerate input is unavoidable. Near degeneracy is associated with ill-conditioning of the input and can lead to a serious loss of accuracy and program failure. These observations lead us to a discussion of problem condition in the context of computational geometry. We use the Voronoi diagram construction problem as a case study and show that problem condition can also play a role in algorithm design.</description><creator>Baer, Lawrence H.</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Mathematics.</subject><title>Numerical aspects of computational geometry</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d217qr68f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7h149r710</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bn9998728</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:11:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis*, after presenting an overview of Mexico, examines the new business environment prevailing in Mexico focussing on the laws and regulations affecting foreign investments and and foreigners in Mexico. It then compares Mexico's foreign direct investment (FDI) regulations with those of Canada and the United States in relation to the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement of 1988. Since Mexico's FDI concerns and policies are similar those of Canada, this comparison provides useful perspectives for a prospective analysis of acceptable FDI regulations in a North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The adoption by Mexico of industrialized country standards and principles has led to the negotiation of a NAFTA between Canada, the United States and Mexico. Further investment liberalization will be a major part of the price Mexico will need to pay for the sucessful conclusion of NAFTA. Such liberalization will benefit Mexico's development provided that it retains a few of the prevailing restrictions and the legal means to implement future policies on investment, thus ensuring for itself a part of the benefits of FDI.

After a brief Introduction, Chapter I will examine whether concentration within the U.S. airline industry is a natural phenomenon or an ordinary monopoly/oligopoly resulting from the behaviour of competitors. In concluding that a natural monopoly/oligopoly does not exist, Chapter II will analyse the policy being antitrust enforcement in the industry. Chapter III will then use the implementation of S 408 of the Federal Aviation Act (FAA) by the Department of Transportation (DOT) as an example of such a policy. Finally, the remaining chapters are dedicated to an analysis of the CRS industry. By using this industry as an example, the writer will suggest that, by removing barriers to entry through aggressive use of S 411 of the FAA, the future may see new entrants enter the market. Emphasis will be placed on the attitude of the DOT in this regard.</description><creator>Bruneau, Jonathan M.</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Competition -- United States.</subject><subject>Barriers to entry (Industrial organization) -- United States.</subject><subject>Antitrust law -- United States.</subject><subject>Airlines -- United States.</subject><title>Antitrust law enforcement within the U.S. airline industry : fact or fiction?</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ng451k73x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p2676x85b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8p58pg10v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:11:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is about how medical knowledge is constructed by staff for patients and their families in a Japanese 'comprehensive care' facility for the treatment of epilepsy (the JEC). The thesis sets out to explain the possible reasons for differences between the number of surgeries of epilepsy performed at the JEC and the number performed in a Canadian institute. I will argue in the thesis that the fundamental difference between the two institutes lies in cross cultural and cross institutional differences in the uses and interpretations of the polysemic phrases 'comprehensive care' and 'quality of life'. They are ideological constructs embedded in a social process of knowledge production. Uncritical acceptance of these institutional objectives has significant ideological consequences in that it (1) justifies the unequal distribution of services, (2) legitimates the treatment program's objectives, and (3) masks the social relations out of which authoritative knowledge about epilepsy at the JEC is produced.</description><creator>Yeh, Eluen Ann</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Epilepsy -- Hospitals -- Japan</subject><title>Comprehensive care : shaping the moral order in a Japanese institute for the treatment of epilepsy</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cc08hh725.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8p58pg10v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Humanities and Social Studies in Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pr76f567d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:11:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>An examination of the Rocky Horror Picture Show illustrates the various ways in which the cinema is closely linked to religious experience. The audience participates in the narrative of the film on both conscious and unconscious levels in the same way as the ancients participated in their myths during ritual ceremonies. Moreover, the audience shifts its mode of cognition in order to appreciate as truth the fantastic events which occur both on and off the screen. Finally, I argue that cult films function as parable in dominant cultures and therefore as primary manifestations of the "counter-civil religion".

In so doing we explore the possibilities of creativity and happiness. His thinking moved from the context of classical Greek thought into a Christian one. By living and recording the dilemma of being unable to act as his intellect mandated, he developed an innovative concept of will. He believed that we are motivated to act through our loves but we have a divided will that can only move towards integration if we love correctly. This necessitates an inward journey. The thesis of this paper is that if one subscribes to Augustine's beliefs there are serious implications for education. The following authors are cited to develop these implications in a modern philosophical and educational setting: Charles Taylor, Iris Murdoch, Israel Scheffler and Bob Samples. Finally, a brief resume of relevant teaching approaches and materials is offered.</description><creator>Thomas, Clare Pat</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Augustine, Saint, Bishop of Hippo -- Contributions in notion of will</subject><subject>Will</subject><subject>Education -- Philosophy</subject><title>Saint Augustine's concept of will as a basis of teaching</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sj1394098.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jw827d76g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Religion and Philosophy in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zs25xb64q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:11:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Muhammad ibn Idris al-Shafi'i (d. 204 H.), the subject of the present thesis, was a Muslim legist who played a central role in the development of Islamic law. He wrote the first treatise on jurisprudence in Islam, a work in which he discusses the nature and sources of Islamic law and develops a legal methodology designed to interpret those sources. Al-Shafi'is legal theory is based on two principles: an insistence on following the scripture and traditions and a restriction on the use of reason. Furthermore, al-Shafi'i established the hierarchy of the four sources of law: the Qur'an, Sunnah, ijma' and qiyas. In the centuries that followed, al-Shafi'is legal theory was to have a great influence. The Hanbali and the Zahiri schools of law arose in an environment that was considerably influenced by al-Shafi'i and his followers. The founders of these two schools strictly followed revelation and restricted the use of reason: Dawud al-Z ahiri even refused to consider qiyas as one of the sources of law. Although not all aspects of al-Shafi'is theory gained acceptance among later scholars, these scholars nevertheless owe much to al-Shafi'i for his efforts at systematizing the method of deriving law.</description><creator>Ḥakīm, Aḥmad</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Shāfiʻī, Muḥammad ibn Idrīs, 767 or 8-820</subject><subject>Islamic law</subject><title>Muḥammad ibn Idris al-Shāfiʻi and his role in the development of Islamic legal theory</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v405sc36f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zs25xb64q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Islamic Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gq67jt317</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:11:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Computerization has had a large impact on hospital intensive care units, allowing continuous monitoring and display of physiological patient data. Treatment of the critically ill patient, however, now requires assimilating large amounts of patient data. Computers can help by processing the data and displaying the information in easy to understand formats. Also, knowledge-based systems can provide advice in diagnosis and treatment of patients. If these systems are to be effective, they must be integrated into the total hospital information system and the separate computer data must be jointly integrated into a new database which will become the primary medical record. This thesis presents the design and implementation of a computerized database for an intensive care unit patient data management system being developed for the Montreal Children's Hospital. The database integrates data from the various PDMS components into one logical information store. The patient data currently managed includes physiological parameter data, patient administrative data and fluid balance data. A simulator design is also described, which allows for thorough validation and verification of the Patient Data Management System. This simulator can easily be extended for use as a teaching and training tool for PDMS users. The database and simulator were developed in C and implemented under the OS/2 operating system environment. The database is based on the OS/2 Extended Edition relational Database Manager.</description><creator>Fumai, Nicola</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Health Care Management.</subject><title>A database for an intensive care unit patient data management system</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tb09j756t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gq67jt317</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xp68kj37x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:11:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis analyzes the structure of identity among surfers in Southern California, who constitute a subculture of American society. Surfer identity is shown to be derived from the act and the setting of surfing itself, from the individual's personal background and motivation for surfing, and from the social interaction among surfers on and off the water. Influences on the identity of surfers as a group include the surfers' own feeling of separateness from American society, surfer communication via the surf economy, the strong association of surfing with adolescence, and the portrayal of surfer symbols in the national media. The outward form of the "surf culture" changes in response to these influences, but the basic identity of surfers remains the same over time.</description><creator>Zane, Wallace W.

It is supported by a body of texts which, in our opinion, reflect the structure of contemporary essayistic discourse in Quebec. By studying three dimensions of the Quebec essay--the socio-political, the personal and the feminist--we will attempt to understand and interpret the various modes through which the essayistic "I" deals with its cultural and ideological contexts. Beyond this principal goal, we offer an account of recent studies on the definition of the literary essay. This vast panorama of Quebec essay is accompanied, in the second part of this work, by the bibliography of texts published during the last two decades. In order to facilitate a clearer assessment of the development of the "genre" in question, we have appended a chronological listing of these texts.</description><creator>Przychodzen, Janusz, 1962-</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Essay</subject><subject>French-Canadian essays -- Québec (Province) -- History and criticism</subject><title>L'essai littérature au Québec (1970-1990) : un projet de liberté</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x920fz83j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1g05fd95z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8s45qb92c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:11:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study investigated the mood states of adolescents who have Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.

These enhanced definitions include more than the basic skills of writing and reading. For women, in particular, literacy has become linked with a variety of issues such as personal growth and development, ways of knowing and the effects of patriarchy on their lives. This study attempts to gain a deeper understanding of the personal meanings of literacy in the lives of a group of women. It examines the meanings women assign to literacy in their daily lives. It explores how literacy fashions and alters women's perceptions of themselves and their place in the world. It also illustrates the dynamics of qualitative research on the participants.</description><creator>Joron, Marie-Francine</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Women's Studies.</subject><subject>Education, Adult and Continuing.</subject><title>Women and personal meanings of literacy : beyond the mere reading and writing</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p5547t57d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1c18dh83x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Administration and Policy Studies in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:j96023029</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:11:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The layered series of the Muskox Intrusion can be divided into four megacyclic units on the basis of field mapping, each beginning with a thick olivine cumulate and succeeded up section by a variety of pyroxenitic and gabbroic cumulates. A systematic change in the order of appearance of orthopyroxene in the pyroxenite units of the layered series is correlated with a decrease in Mg no. (Mg/Mg + $ Sigma$Fe in cation units) at which clinopyroxene joins olivine on the liquidus, and spike-like increases in LIL/HFS ratios, which require that the composition of the magma of the Muskox Intrusion changed through time across the layered series. Mixing of residual liquid with primary liquids replenishing the chamber can explain the upsection decrease in the Mg no. of clinopyroxene at the base of successive pyroxenite units, but this mechanism cannot account for increased ratios of LIL to HFS incompatible elements observed in the olwebsterite of Megacycle #3 and the first websterite of Megacycle #4, because these ratios are not significantly fractionated by closed-system crystal fractionation. Contamination of the parental magma with melts from the paragneiss country rocks can reproduce the observed increase in the ratios of K/Ti and K/Zr. The gabbroic layers of Megacycle #1, #2, and #3 are especially enriched in LIL/HFS ratios, indicating the presence of a highly contaminated magma layer above the uncontaminated magma which crystallized much of the ultramafic series. The spike-like enrichment in LIL/HFS ratios in the pyroxenites suggests that episodic events of mixing occurred between an evolving uncontaminated magma and a highly contaminated magma, accumulated at the roof of the magma chamber.</description><creator>DesRoches, Valérie</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Geology.</subject><title>Petrogenesis of the pyroxenite units in the Muskox intrusion, N.W.T.</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8910jw713.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j96023029</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geological Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xd07gv786</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:11:34Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In thesis thesis we report the design and implementation of a new self-scheduling parallel programming language, SELSYN-C. As parallel processors become more accessible to a broad range of programmers, the development of simple to use and effective programming languages becomes increasingly important. Our approach to the challenge of parallel programming language design and implementation is two-fold: (1) the design of simple extensions to C that are both easy to use for the programmer, and useful for effective compilation, and (2) the design of efficient and effective scheduling strategies that can be automatically supported by a compiler and associated run-time environment. We outline our approach by presenting: (1) our motivation, (2) an overview of the extensions to C that form the SELSYN-C programming language, and (3) the development of a new scheduling mechanism that can be used to effectively compile SELSYN-C programs for a real parallel processor, the BBN Butterfly GP-1000. Different scheduling strategies for this mechanism were studied via several experimental tests and the results of these experiments are reported. A source-to-source compiler supporting the SELSYN-C language has been implemented. Included in this thesis is a description of both the compiler and associated run-time environment.</description><creator>Ding, Weiren</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Selsyn-C : a self-synchronizing parallel programming language</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/st74cs613.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xd07gv786</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6q182n314</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:11:35Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Ce discours vient du postulat que toute societe et culture contient son propre systeme de croyances et un modele de solutions aux problemes de la vie.

Thirty deaf children participated in a lexical decision task and a production task. On both tasks, the children recognized written words that form part of their sign lexicon more accurately and more quickly than words that do not. In the production task, the younger children made fewer errors on written words that share formational correspondences with their signed equivalents, whereas the older children did not. In the lexical decision task, the children recognized words that they signed correctly in the production task more accurately and more quickly than those words they fingerspelled correctly. These results indicate that deaf children organize their recognition of written words around their knowledge of sign language. Further, the children's responses to legal versus illegal pseudowords in the lexical decision task indicate that they can learn the orthographic rules of written English words.</description><creator>Ross, Danielle S.

One aim was to determine how forest age after clearcutting affected woodland amphibians. Path analysis was used to compare different causal effects of forest age on Plethodon cinereus density in 22 deciduous forests of 30, 60 and $&gt;$90 years old. Repopulation of Plethodon followed forest litter recovery, 30 to 60 years after clearcutting. However, the effect of forest age was overridden by that of microtopography and soil texture. Rana sylvatica seemed also sensitive to clearcutting while Bufo americanus, Ambystoma maculatum and A. laterale seemed much less sensitive. A second aim was to determine the status and habitat of stream salamanders at the northern edge of the Adirondacks. Sixty stream sections were sampled. Eurycea bislineata was widespread (in 47 sites) and abundant, especially where rocks were numerous on the shore. The distributions of Gyrinophilus porphyriticus (8 sites) and, to a lesser extent, of Desmognathus fuscus (11 sites) were positively correlated with altitude and the presence of forest. It is proposed that these locations might offer the temperate and oxygenated waters needed by these species during winter and summer.
