While the clinical aspects have received considerable attention, the results are confusing, owing mainly to the use of whole adrenal cortical extract which contains a mixture of cortical hormones several of which possess antagonistic actions. It may be assumed that, under physiological conditions, each cortical hormone is secreted independently, in amount governed by the physiological needs of the moment. Moreover, there is great variation in the relative content of the cortically active steroids in different preparations of cortical extracts obtained by the same method.

This method requires a petrigraphie microscope and also a knowledge of optical moneralogy. Since the mocrochemical method requires only a small sample, it is preferable to other methods in determinative mineralogy. The purpose of this paper 1s to present a dascr1pt1on ot the character1st1c reactions and of the optical properties of the resultant crystalline precipitates of certain common elements. The optical constants are worked out in detail, in so far as the technique used permits. It will be noted that a number of these are not in complete agreement with those given in author1tat1ve tables.

Then afterdiscussing the relation between square waves and those of differentsimple forms, the distinction between individual pulses and trainsof pulses is pointed out. The transient and steady state responsesof linear passive networks are next considered, and the connectionbetween input and response analyzed. Finding such a network toproduce the desired wave shape from a given input is reduced to twogeneral methods.The first method is a deductive one, reducing the required networkcharacteristics to design parameters, for a graphical synthesisprocedure. This is described in a general way only.The second method is an inductive or empirical one, based oncataloguing the responses obtained by applying a given input, atdifferent fundamental frequencies, to various networks. The procedureis illustrated experimentally and analysed mathematicallyfor simple cases. A scheme of classifying complex wave shapes isalso proposed.Some limitations of the two methods are indicated with suggestionsfor future study.

Protective immunity as measured by mouse survival was induced by both S. minnesota and S. typhimurium crude ribosomal vaccines without incorporation into adjuvants. S. minnesota RNA vaccine required adjuvant incorporation to be effective. Immunogenicity did not appear to be related to the protein or somatic antigen content of the ribosomal vaccines.

Arbovirus antigens were used to titrate hyperimmune mouse ascitic fluids and guinea pig sera. With the exception of the orbiviruses, specific clumping was observed for all homologous systems studied. Studies by IEM confirmed the antigenic relationships between arboviruses which had previously been demonstrated by other serological tests. Alphavirus unknowns were identified in the IEM test by the use of appropriate dilutions of antisera. The Hepatitis B core antigen was used in the IEM test to detect core antibody in sera from patients with hepatitis B infections. In the same test, the core antigen did not show any cross-relationship with Hepatitis B surface antigen.</description><creator>Fauvel, Micheline</creator><contributor>Spence, L.

When cells were grown under glucose limitation in chemostat cultures, the morphology was normal at specific growth rates between 0.05 and 0.125 per hour (doubling times between 14 and 5.5 hours) at 25Â°C. At the same specific growth rates and temperature, but under biotin limitation, aberrant morphology was observed. Therefore, cellular aberration is not the result of a reduced growth rate, but probably is due to the impairment of reactions in cell wall synthesis which require biotin as a cofactor. Growth-limiting concentrations of glucose and biotin were established for the organism prior to the chemostat studies. A globiformis 425 undergoes sphere-rod morphogenesis at a specific growth rate of 0.11 per hour at 25Â°c under glucose limitation. Aberrant cells did not exhibit a morphogenetic cycle.</description><creator>Wills, Adrian P.</creator><contributor>Chan, E.

PAR T I examined the production of a state, of hypogammaglobulinemia within a murine model. By sequential treatment of newborn mice with heterologous anti-mouse immunoglobulin M (IgM), panspecific immunosuppression ensued. This was documented by assaying serum immunoglobulin levels, and by comparing these values to macroscopic and microscopic parameters. PART II examined the growth characteristics of two solid neoplasms. By careful selection of the relevant conditions, a change in tumor growth was achieved by immunological manipulation. With the tumor, P-815-X2, this satisfied the definition of neoplastic enhancement. With the tumor T1699 enhancement of tumor growth was vaguely suggested, but not documented. PART III represented an attempt to synthesize these seemingly disparate areas. By removing the immunological factors involved (via panspecific immunosuppression), and by employing an enhancible neoplasm, abrogation or prevention of this phenomenon was attempted. Results were not specific. They suggested that this approach warrants further investigation, but failed to document any definitive relationship.</description><creator>Wherry, Patrick E.</creator><contributor>Gordon, J.

The literature is reviewed concerning collagen: its properties, structure and biosynthesis. The experimental work presented deals with the application of autoradiographic technique to the study of bone matrix turnover in general, and the study of collagen synthesis and turnover in particular. Studies reported concern quantitative autoradiographic assessment of glycine and proline incorporation into the matrix of the distal femoral growth plate of the growing rat. The differential incorporation of tritiated glycine into nucleic acid and protein synthesis in the distal femur of the growing rat has been studied using scintillation methods. The nucleic acid/protein ratio, of tritiated glycine incorporation was determined. Results of this study reveal that it is inaccurate to use this amino acid- in quantitative autoradiography of collagen synthesis in young rats. Finally the effect of high dose calcitonin administration on collagen synthesis in the distal femur of young rats was investigated.</description><creator>Spector, David</creator><contributor>Brooks, C.
