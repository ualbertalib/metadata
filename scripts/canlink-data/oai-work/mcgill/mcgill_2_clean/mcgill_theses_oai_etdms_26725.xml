Mangoes with different quality levels were grouped using principle component analysis (PCA). Feature wavelengths were identified to predict total soluble solids content, water content and firmness using simple correlation, first derivative, partial least square (PLS) regression analysis and measured values. Calibration models were developed using the selected wavelengths from correlation coefficients, first derivative, partial least square (PLS) regression analysis and corresponding maturity parameters employing artificial neural network model to predict total soluble solids content, water content and firmness of the fruit. Performance of the models was compared using the correlation coefficient (r) values. Fruit firmness was predicted with high correlation coefficient (r=0.88) followed by water content (r=0.81) and total soluble solids (r=0.78) using wavelengths selected from simple correlation of first derivative data with the parameters and ANN model. The results of the study demonstrated the scope for further research on maturity and quality evaluation of fruits using hyperspectral imaging technique.</description><creator>Servakaranpalayam.

Hypothesizing that the expression of sst5 affects the regulation of sst 2A, we compared the agonist-induced internalization and intracellular trafficking of sst2A receptors in cells expressing sst2A alone and together with sst5. In cells stably expressing sst 2A, stimulation with a non-selective SRIF agonist ([D-Trp8]-SRIF-14) and a sst2-selective agonist (L-779,976) induced sst2A internalization and decreased responsiveness to further agonist stimulation. By contrast, in cells co-expressing sst2A and sst5, while stimulation with [D-Trp8]-SRIF-14 similarly induced sst 2A internalization and loss of cellular responsiveness, L-779,976 stimulation resulted in a maintenance of surface receptor density, and consequently, continued responsiveness to [D-Trp8]-SRIF-14. Taken together, our results suggest that sst5 exerts an influence on the regulation of sst 2A, such that cells expressing these receptor subtypes are able to remain responsive to SRIF agonists under continuous exposure.</description><creator>Sharif, Nadder.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>Somatostatin receptor 5 (sst₅)-regulated trafficking of somatostatin receptor 2A (sst₂A) in epithelial and pituitary cell lines</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Nadder Sharif, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v405s963x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gf06g302s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8s45q9216</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Bovine mammary glands respond to infection by foreign pathogens such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) through changes in gene expression. Monitoring the gene expression profiles will contribute to better understanding of the pathology of mastitis, and provide important selective markers for future animal breeding programs. Using cultured bovine mammary duct epithelial cells and somatic cells from infected bovine mammary glands, this study first examined the existence of Toll Like Receptors in these two systems. In cultured duct epithelial cells stimulated with E. coli LPS, both TLR 4 and 2 mRNA up regulation was detected at 2h-72h and 12h-48h respectively. For S. aureus LTA TLR 2 mRNA was up regulated at 48 and 72h whereas for TLR 4 mRNA expression up regulation was detected at 24, 48, and 72h in comparison to the Oh (p&lt;0.05). In the case of PGN, an abundant structural component of S. aureus, the expression of TLR 2 mRNA was significant (p&lt;0.05) at 72h whereas TLR 4 mRNA expression increased at 24, 48, and 72h. The expression of these receptors was also monitored in milk cells from cows infected with either E. coli or S. aureus. However, results obtained from the milk cells were inconclusive due to the high individual variability. Afterwards, differential gene expression profiles were monitored by the Differential Display Polymerase Chain Reaction technique in the cultured duct epithelial cells in response to E. coli and S. aureus structural components. A total of 6 candidate fragments were identified for E. coli LPS induction, whereas only one fragment was identified for S. aureus LTA induction. After LTA induction, a specific band was found to be up regulated and confirmed to be GCP-2, a chemokine involved in neutrophil recruitment. In contrast, PGN induction resulted in no change in GCP-2 levels. In different preparations of cultured duct epithelial cells both GCP-2 and IL-8 were confirmed by real time PCR to be up regulated by LTA with a significance of (p&lt;0.01) when compared to the control cells. In the case of the E. coli identified bands, a different approach is necessary to potentially confirm the origin of these fragments. Further large scale screening of the GCP-2 and IL-8 genes in dairy cattle is necessary to test for their potential use as targets to differentiate the mastitis resistant from the mastitis prone cows.</description><creator>Roy, Mélanie.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Mastitis -- Genetic aspects.</subject><subject>Dairy cattle -- Diseases -- Immunological aspects.</subject><subject>Mastitis -- Immunological aspects.</subject><subject>Dairy cattle -- Diseases -- Genetic aspects.</subject><title>Identification and characterization of differentially expressed genes in response to Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in bovine mammary epithelial cells and mammary gland</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Mélanie Roy, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h415p971v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8s45q9216</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Animal Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6m311p651</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The goal of the present study was to measure the reactivity of the salivary cortisol in depressed patients and controls exposed to emotional and neutral memory tasks. We recruited 21 depressed patients, 9 in an active phase of depression, 12 in remission and 17 controls. The 3 groups were similar. The protocol consisted of a task to assess explicit memory in two separate conditions: neutral and emotional words to learn consciously on two separate days. During both assessments, we took salivary samples each 10 minutes to assess the concentration of free cortisol before, during and after the memory task. A repeated analysis of variance was performed on the results of the memory task in two conditions for the 3 groups. An interaction was found between memory performance, conditions and the group [F (4, 64) = 3.053; p = 0.023]. Depressed subjects recalled less words than controls in the neutral condition at the tree different recall periods. The performance of the 3 groups were similar in term of the number of emotional words recalled. An analysis of variance was performed with the repeated measures of cortisol. We found an interaction between the group and the condition [F(1,36) = 5.542; p = 0.024]. We observed a cortisol reactivity among depressed subjects after the memory task in the neutral condition. The reactivity in the emotional condition didn't show such variability in this group. In conclusion, we observed a mood congruency effect in the memory task. Interestingly, the performance was similar for the 3 groups in the emotional condition suggesting that depressed subjects have a memory deficit only with irrelevant information according to the self schemata. The same rational can be used to explain the cortisol reactivity. Incongruent information according to the self schemata of depressed subjects is associated to a rise of the cortisol level.</description><creator>Roy, Mario.</creator><date>2002</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>La réactivité du cortisol salivaire de sujets souffrant de dépression majeure exposés à des stimuli émotifs et neutres /</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Mario Roy, 2002</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4t64gn433.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6m311p651</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2227mp955</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Developmental screening tests greatly improve the accuracy of identifying children with developmental delay. We prospectively tested whether parent-completed questionnaires can be effectively used in the setting of a busy ambulatory pediatric clinic to accurately screen for developmental impairments. We also assessed not only the accuracy of two screening instruments (Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ and the Child Development Inventory (CDI)) but also whether the pediatrician's opinion regarding the child's development could be used as a potential modifier to improve accuracy. The goal would be to devise a screening paradigm that is both time-efficient and practical. Three important conclusions were reached: (1) parent-completed questionnaires can be feasibly utilized in the setting of a pediatric clinic; (2) pediatrician's opinion had little effect in ameliorating the accuracy of either questionnaire; and (3) accuracy of these screening instruments did not meet the requisite standard for development screening tests as set by current recommendations. Based on these results and those of other studies, we question whether a single screening instrument at one point in time is sufficient to accurately estimate the developmental status of a child. This study raises important questions about how developmental screening can be performed and suggests that screening should occur over time.</description><creator>Rydz, Dawid.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Screening for developmental delay in the setting of an ambulatory pediatric clinic</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Dawid Rydz, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ns0646310.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2227mp955</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0c483j666</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The vast majority of real-world data is stored using relational representations. Unfortunately, many machine learning techniques are unable to handle rich relational models. Probabilistic Relational Models (PRMs) are an extension of the Bayesian network frame work which allows relational structure to be fully exploited. They are a formalism based on relational logic for describing probabilistic models of structured data which also allow us to model uncertainty in the relationship between objects and the attributes of those objects. In this thesis we present an implementation of PRMs which allows defining conditional probability distributions over mixtures of discrete and continuous variables. This is an important new feature. We provide experimental results using our package on both synthetic and real data sets.</description><creator>Royes, Andrew.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Algorithms and applications for probabilistic relational models</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Andrew Royes, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tm70mv45d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0c483j666</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4x51hj308</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Research for a dissolved nitrogen budget was conducted at Mer Bleue bog near Ottawa, ON, from May 20, 2003 to May 21, 2004. Mer Bleue is located within an area experiencing the highest levels of atmospheric nitrogen deposition in North America, although these levels are only low to moderate compared to those in Europe. Continuous measurements of precipitation, evapotranspiration, bog water table level and outflow water depth were used in conjunction with discrete measurements of precipitation and outflow to determine the hydrologic budget. Water samples were taken from precipitation collectors, piezometers at various depths and locations throughout the bog, and an outflow point in order to gauge changes and patterns in chemical concentrations at various points throughout the bog. The nature of the bog morphology and landscape allowed for collection of water samples from a single outflow point. Chemical analysis combined with the water budget revealed that the majority of the dissolved nitrogen is entering the bog as NO3-N and NH 4-N (inorganic nitrogen), and leaving the bog as dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). Export of nitrogen was generally low relative to the input, and was only a very small fraction of the huge amount of nitrogen stored in the bog. Bog porewater concentrations were dominated by DON and did not show spatial patterns in relation to the bog edge. When comparing the annual accretion of nitrogen at the bog to the long-term storage numbers, it was apparent that there is a missing source of nitrogen. From the literature and patterns in the bog, it appears that this missing input at Mer Bleue is likely due to a combination of previously unmeasured nitrogen fixation and more diverse usage of DON by bog vegetation.</description><creator>Rattle, Jean.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Nitrogen cycle -- Ontario -- Ottawa Region.</subject><subject>Peatlands -- Ontario -- Ottawa Region.</subject><subject>Atmospheric nitrogen compounds -- Ontario -- Ottawa Region.</subject><title>Dissolved nitrogen dynamics in an ombrotrophic bog</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Jean Rattle, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zs25x892g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hj308</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zg64tm238</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Anomaly A of the Clarence Stream gold deposits contains mineralized structures that bear geometrical relationships to regional folding events. Structural mapping at the regional scale reflects at least four deformational events, three of which appear to control the folded geometry of Anomaly A (D2, D3, and D4). F2 and F3 folds are in a coaxial relationship and are refolded into a dome and basin geometry by F4 folds. Structural analysis of a mineralization zone exposed at the surface indicates that gold mineralization is present within a quartz vein system that contains veins generated during both D2 and D3. Three-dimensional representation of Anomaly A created using drill-core data and gOcad suggests that the quartz vein system was emplaced in fault structures generated during D2 and formed in brecciated dilation zones during D3. Three of the four zones that make up Anomaly A have F2 hinge surfaces that can be linked in a fashion compatible with the style of F3 and F4 folds. The apparent continuity of these three zones indicates the potential for km-scale mineralized structures at Anomaly A.</description><creator>Ravenelle, Jean-François.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Geology.</subject><title>Architecture of gold mineralization at Anomaly A of the Clarence Stream deposits, southern New Brunswick</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Jean-François Ravenelle, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pc289j29k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zg64tm238</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:w0892b09v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Himesis is a complete yet minimal kernel for meta-modelling and model transformation, which consists of a specification of hierarchical graphs and in a highly efficient matching algorithm. Himesis graphs encode the essence of models: nodes, edges, containment, attributes, names and labels. There is a defined set of events which transform the graphs. Above all Himesis introduces an explicit notion of hierarchy, which allows the specification of formalisms which were very hard to meta-model in the past, such as graph grammars. Moreover, with containment, it is possible to couple and reuse existing formalisms. Himesis implements HVF, a new matching algorithm based on the VF2 approach. HVF extends VF2 with hierarchy and with several optimization strategies. It was designed to support advanced features that are required for graph rewriting, such as matching from a context as well as negative application conditions. We show that HVF is a faster algorithm than VF2 for matching of flat graphs. HVF is particularly efficient when matching irregular graphs.</description><creator>Provost, Marc, 1981-</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Himesis : a hierarchical subgraph matching kernel for model driven development</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Marc Provost, 2005</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qr46r118x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w0892b09v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rf55z8078</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Fluid visualization techniques and fluid solvers are widely used in computer graphics and scientific visualization. There is a wide variety of fluid visualization methods. We discuss in detail an important visualization technique known as the Line Integral Convolution (LIC). We perform an experiment to show how the LIC results are affected by the input parameter. We also discuss the nature of the fluid velocity field and provide a brief classification of various fluid visualization techniques. This is followed by fluid solvers, which model the dynamics of the underlying fluid and are used to generate the discrete vector field that represents the velocity of the fluid on a set of sampled physical locations. The Navier-Stokes equations, which model the underlying fluid, are explained. We provide a detailed derivation and explanation of a widely used fluid solver known as the Stable Fluid Solver, developed by Jos Stam. Experiments are performed to demonstrate the method.

Recent studies on cancer have detected many mutations and much variability in the mitochondrial genome, particularly in the non-coding region (D-loop). The present study set out to sequence and examine the hypervariable region I (HVR-I) of the D-loop and transfer RNA Leucine (tRNA Leu) for mutations in breast cancer patients. Methods. Tumor and normal tissues from 17 patients that carry mutations in either BRCA1 (n = 11), BRCA2 (n = 3) or are non-carriers of mutations in either gene (n = 3) were examined by direct genomic sequencing of PCR products. Results. We found 44 variants in the HVR-I of 16 patients, twenty-six were polymorphisms, four somatic variants, and fourteen variations were undetermined because corresponding (unaffected) normal tissue was not available. One BRCA1 mutated tumor had four somatic tumor variants (1/14). All other BRCA1/BRCA2 mutated tumors had no somatic variants. Nine out of 14 (64%) of these patients had a total 22 germline variants. One out of three (33%) non-carriers had four germ-line variants. No variants were found in tRNA Leu. A five kilobase deletion was also found as a germ-line variant in two of seven (29%) patients. There were no obvious differences in the frequency of homoplasmic variants in the mitochondrial genome between the BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers and non-carriers. Conclusion. Direct genomic sequencing of PCR products showed that there were no striking differences in homoplasmic variants between tumor and normal tissue, thus homoplasmic variants in mtDNA did not have a role in tumorigenesis in our samples. We speculate that the marked differences in mutation frequencies observed amongst various studies could be the result of differences in the techniques used to generate and analyze the data. EGFR background. Recent studies have identified mutations in the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in lung carcinomas. These mutations make the tumors sensitive to a molecular targeted drug called getifinib. Methods. We also sequenced the TK domain of EGFR in 16 breast cancer patients (BRCA1 = 9, BRCA2 = 4, non-carriers = 3) for mutations. Results. We did not find mutations reported previously in lung carcinomas but we identified other variants, in exons 18, 20 and 21 of the mutation carvers. We found one out of thirteen (eight percent) of the BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers had somatic tumor variants, three out of thirteen (23%) patients had somatic variants found only in the adjacent normal tissue, and four out of thirteen (31%) patients had germ-line variants. The non-carriers did not have any variants. The variants found in the exons were two missense variants in exon 18 of two patients, three 'silent' substitutions in exon 20 of three patients, and two patients had exon 21 variants; a missense variant and a 'silent' substitution. Intronic variants were also found in three patients. Patient 5420 harbored more than one variant in the tumor tissue and patient 5483 harbored more than one somatic variant in the adjacent normal tissue. Although the sample size is small, these preliminary results seem to show a difference in EGFR variants between BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers and non-carriers. Conclusion . EGFR variants found in this study were not the same ones found in lung cancer, but other variants could be significant in breast cancer progression and could possibly represent drug targets for future therapy.</description><creator>Makriyianni, Ioli.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Biology, Genetics.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</subject><title>Mutation analysis of hereditary breast cancers</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Ioli Makriyianni, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/db78tc26g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w37637068</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Human Genetics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vx021f47r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Antisense oligonucleotides (AON) offer a rational approach for drug design. The specificity of AONs towards a complementary messenger RNA (mRNA) target via Watson and Crick base pairing as well as their ease of synthesis render this technology very attractive. RNase H-degradation of mRNA via formation of a AON/mRNA hybrid is crucial to mainstream antisense technologies. Numerous studies have demonstrated the importance of the AON's structure and conformational flexibility for efficient induction of RNase H activity. However the precise mode of action and substrate specificity of the RNase H are not fully understood at present. Our Laboratory recently discovered that incorporation of flexible acyclic linkers (e.g. butanediol, 2'-seco-RNA) significantly amplifies enzyme activity. Unfortunatly incorporation of such linkers was accompanied by a drop in the thermal stability of the AON/RNA hybrids. This prompted us to incorporate a less flexible linker such as a peptide nucleic acid, with the hope to maintain similar enzymatic activity while increasing the duplex thermal stability. This thesis highlights the synthesis of the 5'-amino nucleoside analogue required for the incorporation of the peptide nucleic acid in both 2'-fluoroarabinonucleic acid (2'F-ANA) and DNA. Circular dichroism experiments afforded information on the hybrid conformation in solution, whereas UV thermal melting studies provided a measure of the thermal stability of such hybrid duplexes. Finally, ability of various linker modified AON/RNA hybrids to activate the RNase H enzyme was evaluated in parallel with the corresponding native unmodified DNA/RNA hybrids. Incorporation of a PNA residue within DNA or 2'-FANA did not afford improvement in neither thermal stability nor enzymatic cleavage (except for homopolymeric sequences vs DNA) as compared to control or butyl-sequences.</description><creator>Pâtureau, Bénédicte Marie.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Chemistry, Organic.</subject><title>Induction of rnase H activity by arabinose-peptide nucleic acids</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Bénédicte Marie Pâtureau, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bg257f32c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vx021f47r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nc580m93r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Alpha-synuclein is a major protein constituent of neuronal Lewy bodies (LB) in Parkinson's disease (PD). Astroglial over-expression of the heme-degrading enzyme, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the PD substantia nigra promotes mitochondrial iron sequestration and may sensitize dopaminergic neurons to oxidative injury (51). The effects of transient hHO-1 transfection on levels of endogenous or co-transfected alpha-synuclein (WT or A30P) were measured by Western blot in M17 cells in the presence or absence of the HO and proteasome inhibitors, SnMP and lactacystin, respectively. Deferoxamine and bilirubin were administered to sister cultures to delineate the role(s) of iron and bilirubin (heme breakdown products) on altered alpha-synuclein metabolism. hHO-1 transfection significantly decreased endogenous and transgenic WT alpha-synuclein levels, effects reversed by SnMP, lactacystin or deferoxamine (but not bilirubin), but had no effects on A30P levels. Thus, iron liberated by HO-1 over-expression may induce proteasomal degradation of WT alpha-synuclein, thereby promoting synaptic dysfunction. Conversely, failure of HO-1 to suppress mutant alpha-synuclein and its putative toxic gain of function may predispose to familial PD.</description><creator>Patel, Amar.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>The effects of human heme oxygenase-1 (hHO-1) on wild type and mutant (A30P) alpha-synuclein expression in human neuroblastoma cells /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Amar Patel, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9w0323374.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nc580m93r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k0698782r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Two ultrasound systems were studied to investigate the effects of positional and volumetric prostate variations on dosimetry over the course of external radiation therapy. A 2D system, currently used at the Montreal General Hospital for patient repositioning, was compared to a 3D system invented recently. Prostate variations were quantified from ultrasound images acquired daily during a 2003 clinical study. A method was devised to introduce ultrasound information in a Monte Carlo Treatment Planning System previously developed at McGill. Patient repositioning was evaluated for both systems using dose-volume histograms of Voxel Monte Carlo dose calculation. Repositioning with the 3D system, neglecting volume changes, was found to bring the target dose to within 1 % of the planned dose, rather than the 12 % of the clinical 2D system. However, when considering the varying 3D volumes, the dose could only be corrected to within 7 %. These results indicate that the 3D system provides not only a more accurate assessment of prostate displacements, but also volumetric information that significantly affects the dosimetry.</description><creator>Mark, Clarisse Ildikó.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Biophysics, Medical.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Radiology.</subject><subject>Physics, Radiation.</subject><title>Image-guided radiotherapy using 2D and 3D ultrasound combined with Monte Carlo dose calculations in prostate treatments</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Clarisse Ildikó Mark, 2005</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x920fx17r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k0698782r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7d278t34d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs) maintain dynamic acetylation and deacetylation of histories and other proteins in vivo, and are actively involved in the control of gene transcription and other nuclear processes. One mechanism by which functions of these enzymes are regulated operates through differential intracellular compartmentalization. HDAC4, -5, -7 and -9, the four members of class IIa, shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in a manner dependent on specific phosphorylation stimulated by several known kinases, and these deacetylases possess intrinsic nuclear import and export signals for dynamic nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. The ability to change their intracellular localization implies that class IIa HDACs have some potential functions in different subcellular compartments. To gain additional insights into this, I first focused on studying the function and regulation of HDAC4. As a result, I identified protein kinase D3 as a novel kinase for HDAC4 and found that this kinase physically interacts with HDAC4 and stimulates its nuclear export. Then I tried to purify protein complexes of RFXANK and ANKRA2, two homologous ankyrin-repeat proteins that are known to associate with HDCA4, using the tandem affinity purification (TAP) strategy. The results that I have obtained reveal a novel mechanism for regulating the nuclear export of HDAC4 and suggest that its cytoplasmic localization may also be indicative of potential cytoplasmic functions rather than just for simple sequestration from its nuclear targets.</description><creator>Li, Cathy Shije, 1974-</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Biophysics, Medical.</subject><title>Function and regulation of histone deacetylase 4</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Cathy Shije Li, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w6634397r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7d278t34d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xw42n820t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous intracellular messenger that mediates a wide range of physiological, behavioural, and cognitive events. A novel nitric oxide mimetic, GT 1061 was developed as an Alzheimer's Disease therapy, and has previously been shown to improve performance in rodent learning paradigms. The aim of the present studies was to determine if GT 1061 confers protection against neurotoxicity, and activates via phosphorylation, survival and learning-related intracellular targets. Cell viability assays showed that GT 1061 (30-300 muM) was not able to protect neurons against hydrogen peroxide toxicity or serum deprivation. Primary rat hippocampal and cortical cultures treated with GT 1061 showed some elevation in phosphorylated CREB (cyclic-AMP response element binding protein) and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) between concentrations of 10-300 muM, though without reaching statistical significance. No change in phosphorylated Akt (protein kinase B) or PKC (protein kinase C) was observed. Intraperioneal injection of GT 1061 (1 and 5 mg/kg) had no effect on the levels of phosphorylated CREB, MAPK, or PKC in the CNS, but phosphorylated Akt showed a tendency to increase with GT 1061. Taken together, these data suggest that these intracellular signalling pathways are not strongly stimulated by GT 1061 in our experimental models.</description><creator>Li, Amanda M.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>Intracellular signalling targets downstream of GT 1061, a novel nitric oxide mimetic</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Amanda M.

To develop a reliable distributed system, replication is necessary. The Adapt SIB replication system [27] provides a feasible solution for a reliable application server system. However, the system can not scale up since there is always only one primary server executing client requests. This thesis presents the LB system which is based on the Adapt SIB system, but with more functions. The LB system may have the same number of server replicas as in the Adapt SIB system, but it can have more than one primary server, each being able to execute client requests. Thus, a load-balancing mechanism is needed to distribute the load equally among different replicas. In addition, reconfiguration in case of failure, and restart must be considered as well. This thesis presents load-balancing and reconfiguration solutions for the LB application server system.</description><creator>Liang, Xiaoguang, 1966-</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Load-balancing and reconfiguration in a J2EE application server system</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Xiaoguang Liang, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7p88cg85n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8623hz06b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0k225b309</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Chlorine has been used extensively as an industrial compound for synthesis of innumerable commercial product, including bleaches, organic diluents, adhesives, dust reducing agents, cutting oils, disinfectants, and monomers for plastics, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides. Despite societal contribution of chlorinated chemicals, there have recent suggestion by some environmental associations and scientists to ban the industrial use of chlorine. After their release into environment, organochlorine pollutants are stable and resistant to chemical and biodegradation and preferentially accumulation in the sequence food chain. As a detoxification hydrodechlorination (HDC) reactions change neither the thermodynamics of the reaction nor the equilibrium composition. Also, there is no possibility of producing hazard by-product such as polychlorodibenzodioxins and polychlorodibenzofuran. Liquid phase hydrodechlorination of 4-chlorophenols was studied over the temperature range from room temperature (R.T) to 80°C using various Nickel catalysts and active hydrogen sources. Raney Nickel system converted 4-chlorophenol to ~49 mol% of phenol and ~34 mol% cyclohexanol at R.T. and proved to be more reactive than Ni0 and Ni-Fe. The HDC system with borohydrides as hydrogen source achieved hydrodechlorination at lower temperature than the system with molecular hydrogen. Ni-Al proved to be reactive for hydrogenolysis in the presence of borohydride at R.T. A somewhat surprising temperature dependence of Ni-Al mediated HDC in absence of H2 and borohydride was absented. Optimization with Ni-Al under mild condition was performed using central composite design (CCD). Optimal condition for maximum phenol production was predicted to be 80°C, for 11 h with 30 mg of catalyst. 98 mol% phenol is produced under this condition. A continuous stream of pentachlorophenol (PCP, 0.5 mg/min) in mixture of supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) and hydrogen was hydrodechlorinated by a heated column of gamma-alumina supported palladium (5 % w/w). Dechlorination efficiencies and time to reach equilibrium were influenced appreciable by the temperature and substrate delivery rate. The product from reaction at 210°C, 2000 psi accounted for 92 mol% phenol and 2.3 mol% cyclohexanone. The temperature was maintained at 210°C while the pressure and content of H2 in the gas mixture was changed to 1000 ~ 2000 psi, 5 % and 16 % (v/v) H2/CO2. The production of phenol and cyclohexanone was greater at higher pressures (2000 psi.) with the formation of methoxy-cyclohexane. The content of H2 in the gas mixture was not appreciable influenced the product distribution.</description><creator>Kim, Jun-Kyoung, 1973-</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Chlorophenols -- Environmental aspects.</subject><title>Catalytic hydrodechlorination of chlorophenols</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Jun-Kyoung Kim, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0p0967313.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0k225b309</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:02870w123</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is a very serious disease affecting nearly 5 in 1000 newborns each year. The development of PPHN has been linked to a decrease in the activity and expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Thus, it is critical to understand the mechanisms by which eNOS is regulated to identify new pathways and novel therapies for PPHN. eNOS is dynamically regulated at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, post-translational, and developmental levels, however mechanisms of this regulation are unresolved. Our data indicates that increases in eNOS expression and activity correlate with increased cellular levels of labile zinc (Zn). In addition, our analysis of the eNOS promoter indicated the presence of a putative heavy metal response element (HRE) in the 5'-flanking sequence. We hypothesized that nitric oxide (NO) may be regulating eNOS expression and activity indirectly through its ability to regulate cellular levels of free Zn. Further, we hypothesized that Zn exerts an effect on eNOS at the transcriptional and post-translational levels. Our results suggested that both NO and hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2) activate eNOS in a Zn-dependent manner by liberating cellular stores of Zn and activating the heavy metal-responsive transcription factor 1, MTF-1, which then would bind to the eNOS 5'-regulatory MRE. We found that basal zinc levels in endothelial cells (ECs) helped maintain eNOS promoter activity and total protein levels, but did not affect eNOS dimer levels. However, supplementing ECs with exogenous Zn increased eNOS total and dimer protein levels and activity, mostly through MTF-1. At higher, non-toxic doses of Zn, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was much higher. eNOS was inhibited by high ROS levels through enzyme fragmentation. Lastly, an eNOS enzyme cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), was found to help maintain eNOS protein due to its high antioxidant potential. In conclusion, eNOS appears to be regulated by NO and ROS through an increase in intracellular Zn, thus activating MTF-1, which binds to the 5' flanking region of the eNOS promoter.</description><creator>Kim, Ji-hae, 1982-</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>The role of the D-domain in the transport of prosaposin to the lysosomes /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Ji-hae Kim, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z029p4982.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/02870w123</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cc08hf838</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Mutations in the parkin gene result in early-onset, autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease (PD). Parkin is an E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase that promotes the covalent attachment of Ub to specific substrate proteins that are targeted for proteasomal degradation. Here, we identify the synaptic PDZ protein PICK1 (Protein Interacting with C-Kinase 1) as a novel substrate for parkin-mediated ubiquitination. We establish that the PDZ domain of PICK1 interacts with the extreme C-terminus of parkin, which encodes a type II PDZ-binding motif. We demonstrate in vitro that parkin directly ubiquitinates wildtype PICK1 but not a PDZ domain mutant, PICK1 KD/AA. In cells, ubiquitination of PICK1 is enhanced by expression of wildtype parkin protein, but not by a ligase-inactive mutant, C431F. Interestingly, both in vitro and in cells, we found that parkin predominantly promotes PICK1 monoubiquitination rather than polyubiquitination. Polyubiquitination is known to target substrates for proteasomal degradation whereas monoubiquitination may regulate protein-protein interactions and intracellular trafficking. Consistent with monoubiquitination, PICK1 levels were not elevated by knockdown of parkin expression in PC12 cells or in parkin knockout mouse brain and, furthermore, we found no evidence for parkin-mediated proteasomal degradation of PICK1. Given that PICK1 is found in the same synaptic and postsynaptic density fractions as parkin and that PICK1 interacts with membrane proteins important for synaptic transmission, such as the AMPA receptor and dopamine transporter, ubiquitination of PICK1 by parkin offers a molecular mechanism for regulating synaptic function. These findings therefore provide important new insight into the role of parkin-dependent ubiquitination in synaptic transmission and Parkinson's disease.</description><creator>Joch, Monica.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>The synaptic PDZ protein PICK1 is a novel substrate for the E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Monica Joch, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1c18dg06m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cc08hf838</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9k41zd81j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Background. The mechanism by which tracheal occlusion (TO) induces lung growth is unknown. The sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a signaling protein essential for bronchial branching and lung maturation in rats. Shh expression is delayed in nitrofen-induced congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). The aim of this study was to see if TO could up-regulate Shh expression in CDH. Methods. To create CDH in fetal rats, time-dated pregnant rats were gavaged 100 mg of nitrofen on day 9.5 post-conception. TO was performed on day 19 of gestation (term=22 days). Animals were sacrificed on day 20 and 21. Lung growth was measured by lung to body weight ratio (LW/BW) and histology. The expression of Shh was measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results. TO induced growth in nitrofen-affected lungs in comparison to controls. Higher levels of Shh mRNA expression were observed in the nitrofen-affected lungs on day 21. TO in the nitrofen-affected animals lowered the mRNA expression levels and brought them to control levels. Conclusions. The nitrofen-induced hypoplasia of CDH is reversible with TO. Shh-mRNA expression in the nitrofen-affected lungs is delayed and peaks later during gestation. TO decreases Shh-mRNA expression levels and brings them to control levels.</description><creator>Khan, Nasir.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><title>Effects of tracheal occlusion (TO) on sonic-hedgehog (Shh) expression in animal models of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Nasir Khan, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/12579s49d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9k41zd81j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Surgical Research</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8910jt915</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Prolactin (PRL) is a highly versatile hormone in terms of its biological functions. In Galliformes, high levels of PRL are associated with incubation behaviour and hatching. It has been shown that these high levels of PRL were associated with an increased ratio of glycosylated PRL (G-PRL) versus non-glycosylated PRL (NG-PRL) in turkey (Bedecarrats et al., 1999a). This suggests that glycosylation of PRL is related to its proper function during those stages of life. However, the mechanism(s) controlling post-translational modification of PRL are unknown. In order to investigate genes associated with the glycosylation of PRL, an in vitro study was undertaken. The pituitary glands of day 24 turkey embryos (n=60) were collected and pooled into two groups which were incubated in medium 199 for 4 hours in the absence or presence of 10-7 M vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). Western blot analysis of PRL was used to assess the response of the pituitary glands to the VIP stimulation. As expected, the absolute level of PRL as well as the percentage of glycosylated PRL isoform increased following stimulation with VIP. The mRNA of both stimulated and non-stimulated samples were extracted and reverse transcribed into cDNA. Using suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH), a cDNA subtractive library which only contained differentially expressed cDNAs between VIP stimulated and non-VIP stimulated turkey pituitary glands was constructed. Seventeen percent of the genes from the library are related to cell proliferation and apoptosis. Ten genes were selected for real-time PCR analysis. The functions of these genes and their potential roles in response to the stimulation by VIP and glycosylation of PRL are discussed.</description><creator>Ho, Ming-Kai, 1978-</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Prolactin.</subject><subject>Turkeys.</subject><subject>Glycosylation.</subject><title>Characterization of glycosylation of prolactin in galliformes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Ming-Kai Ho, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ww72bb80d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8910jt915</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Animal Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7w62f8480</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In C. albicans, a MAP kinase pathway has been implicated in aspects of controlling hyphal development. We have examined the transcription profile of cells deleted for the transcription factor Cph1 as well as Cst20, Hst7 and Cek1, three upstream kinases potentially involved in Cph1 regulation. Deletion of these four elements does not block filament induction by serum and does not dramatically affect the transcription profile of yeast-hyphal transition, but deletion of CPH1 delays filamentation. Over-expression of Cph1 by ADH1pt-CPH1 significantly enhances filamentation, suggesting that Cph1 is helpful but not essential for filament induction. Interestingly, the transcription profile of ADH1pt-CPH1 expressing cells under yeast conditions is similar to that of wild type strains undergoing the yeast-hyphal transition. Finally, it appears that Cek1 and its regulators Hst7 and Cst20 may control the repression of genes such as CHT2 through a process independent of the Cph1p transcription factor.</description><creator>Huang, Hao, 1967-</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Mitogen-activated protein kinases.</subject><subject>MAP Kinase Signaling System.</subject><subject>Candida albicans -- Molecular genetics.</subject><title>Transcript profiling of a MAP kinase pathway in C. albicans</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Hao Huang, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q237hs217.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7w62f8480</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nv935323h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>To study the influence of early diagenesis, left valves of fresh cultured bivalves (Mytilus edulis) were deployed in the natural environments (Panama, Barbados and New Brunswick), and right valves were kept in the laboratory as the controls. After 9 days, 8 months and 1 year, the retrieved shells have shown different macroscopic changes in weight, shell area, colour and luster. The microstructure of nacre shows organic matrix maceration, dissolution on the edges of tablets, and abiotic CaC03 reprecipitation on the surface and edges of nacre tablets. High-precision analyses of their carbon and oxygen stable isotope ratios show bulk differences of up to 0.4%o between experimental and control valves within 1 year. Results therefore indicate that early diagenesis can start very quickly post-mortem, and the nature of these changes varies with burial environments.</description><creator>Huang, Zhenzhen, 1982-</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Paleontology.</subject><title>Experimental assessment of early diagenetic changes in marine bivalve shells</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Zhenzhen Huang, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kk91fk80h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nv935323h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):26750</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
