It is called a "Revival", but many who do not know of what it is a revival still continue to regard the nineteenth century as the only preserve for tracking down romanticism. But there are other happy hunting-grounds in English literature for the romanticist-hunter. Romanticism is not an exotic on English soil, but a truly native growth. The poets of every century, except the eighteenth, have been eminently romantic, and whenever an attempt has been made to "guide the stream of poetry through artificial channels" of classicism, the native instinct has very soon asserted itself and led it back to its river-bed.

The original Wilfley table was invented in 1895, but long before this time, the essential elements, riffling and jerking, were known to the art of concentration, Tables such as Rittinger's and Lampert's had one or other of these factors, but were never of paramount importance, and it was the combination of these factors bY Wilfley, which completely revolutionised table concentration.

Prior to the first quarter of the 19th century, as Lord Acton points out, the attitude of the historian was relatively uncritical; and his methods were in sharp contrast to the methods of modern research. Moreover the amount of material available has been so increased that this in itself makes for a much greater degree of completeness.

The results were submitted to the University in the form of a thesis. Mr. Pitts concludes: "This investigation clearly demonstrates the importance of considering the secondary stresses in all bridge construction in which the rivetted or rigid joint is used. It further shows the nature of the subject to be such as to forbid of a quick determination of these stresses, and the impossibility of deducing definite rules or formulae".

The desire to practise that particular type ofdeception seems to have been in the air, though the age was slow to detect the majority of those frauds, which, as would be expected, vary markedly in their importance and complexity. Most of them were contrived by men young in years, some of whom were endowed with genius, a few of whom possessed talent, and yet others who could boast of neither. The reason for their prevalence at that particular period cannot be assigned readily, apart from the fact that the age was unique in its credulity, inclined to believe almost any hoax.

(2) As the power of the State grew, retaliation became more and more a public duty and the Mosaic Code was gradually modified by thepractice of sanctuary and by the system of composition for injuriessuch as Wergeld- a certain sum of money paid as compensation for a certain injury, (3).
