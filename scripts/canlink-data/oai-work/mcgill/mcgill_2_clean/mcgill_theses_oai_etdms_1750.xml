The technical innovations are asking for an international institutional implementation, which has not yet started. After a brief look at the technical aspects of the new systems (Chapter II), existing institutional arrangements of international satellite systems, air-navigation infrastructure and air traffic control are outlined (Chapter III). A legal analysis presents the obstacles and alternatives future institutional arrangements will be confronted with, and leads to a definition of the institutional problem (Chapter IV). The core of the thesis is a proposal for regional intergovernmental organizations, which coordinate the operation of aeronautical satellite communications and air traffic control as an intermediary between the States and service providers (Chapter V). Among other problems financing, user charges, and liability are discussed. Legal problems of navigation systems are discussed on the base of the emerging global systems (Chapter VI).</description><creator>Kaiser, Stefan.</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Mass Communications.</subject><subject>Remote Sensing.</subject><subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</subject><subject>Transportation.</subject><subject>Law.</subject><title>Legal implications of satellite based communication navigation and surveillance systems for civil aviation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j098zd25r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3197xn81v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bc386m564</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:12:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Michelangelo considered a mastery of the body and anatomy to be the essential "theory" articulating the practice of architecture. For him, the reality of the moving human figure embodied the supreme difficulty of life as animation. By his architectural appropriation of the figure, human artifice was understood to be circumscribed by the radical intelligibility of the processes of life. This study is an articulation of his vital understanding of the living body and artifice by the "vision" of anatomy. The outline of an artifice faithful to the radical life of things is first examined in the thought and practice of medicine in the Renaissance. Upon this understanding, the coherence of Michelangelo's unprecedented emphasis upon the living body for architecture may be articulated. It concludes with an elaboration of his "theory"; the vision of anatomy as a dynamic drawing of things as they appear.</description><creator>Klassen, Helmut W.</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Michelangelo Buonarroti, 1475-1564</subject><title>Michelangelo : architecture and the vision of anatomy</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8g84mp44x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bc386m564</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wd375z52d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:12:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis outlines a syntactic analysis of Noun Incorporation in Cree. In this construction, certain morphemes, 'medials', that appear as the nominal root of an external NP can alternatively appear within a verb. This thesis extends previous analyses of Algonquian medials by utilizing the theory of Incorporation developed in Baker (1988b). Within this theory of grammar, medials are base-generated as nouns within an 'object' NP and then optionally adjoined to the verb stem as a result of head (X$ sp{ rm o}$) movement. Established restrictions on head movement can account for many properties of NI, including paraphrasing, doubling, bare modifiers, possible thematic relations, and differences between NI and compounds. The efficacy of the syntactic approach validates a modular account of polysynthetic word formation. In addition, the distribution of Cree NI validates several putatively universal principles of theta-role assignment.</description><creator>Mellow, John Dean</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Cree language -- Syntax</subject><subject>Cree language -- Noun</subject><title>A syntactic analysis of noun incorporation in Cree</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128ng83t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wd375z52d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Linguistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x346d634h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:12:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis presents a new robot wrist design that is fully parallel and actuator redundant. Actuator redundancy refers to the addition of more actuators than are strictly necessary to control the mechanisms without increasing the mobility. The uses of this form of redundancy include the ability to partially control the internal forces, increase the workspace, remove singularities and augment the dexterity. As the proposed wrist design is fully parallel, it exhibits high structural rigidity accompanied by a large load carrying capacity as well as superior dynamic response. In the first part of this thesis, the wrist architecture is developed and then analyzed with respect to its kinematics and the resulting singular surfaces. The workspace is then investigated taking into account these factors as well as limits imposed by the collision of movable links and fixed trusses of the assembly. Next, the kinematics of tendon actuated mechanisms are investigated. Tendons display an intrinsically non-linear behaviour. They are shown to have additional constraints that result in singularities of a type not found in linear systems. These act to reduce the workspace and influence the mapping of external to internal forces.

The memoirs describe Jewish existence in eighteenth century Poland and provide valuable information regarding economic, social and cultural matters of that era. Uncovered in 1912, the manuscript was edited and published in Hebrew and translated into English by Dr. M. Vishnitzer. By primary supposition of the present thesis is that Dr. Vishnitzer's transcription of the manuscript is inaccurate, and for this reason, a re-working of the memoirs has been undertaken. In addition to providing an authentic transcription of the manuscript, this thesis also contains a description of Birkenthal's life, an analysis of the uniqueness of this somewhat exceptional person and an account of how the memoirs have been used in the literature. Moreover, the historical value of the memoirs has been assessed, and an indepth analysis of the flaws contained in Vishniter's transcription has been provided.</description><creator>Geller, Joseph</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Ber, of Bolechow, 1723-1805</subject><subject>Jews -- Europe, Eastern -- History -- 18th century</subject><subject>Wischnitzer, Mark, 1882-1955</subject><subject>Jews -- Europe, Eastern -- Biography</subject><subject>Bolekhiv (Ukraine) -- History.</subject><title>The manuscript version of the memoirs of Dov Ber Birkenthal (Ber of Bolochew)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kh04dr739.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9k41zg59f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x633f3440</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:12:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We hypothesize that continuous electrical stimulation (ES) of denervated muscle using implanted electrodes and a pulse generator lessens the effects of denervation and helps to preserve muscle integrity. Ten dogs underwent sciatic nerve severance, common peroneal nerve repair, and implantation of stimulating devices. The proportion of muscle weight preserved was significantly greater in the stimulated muscle than in the untreated denervated muscle (p $&lt;$ 0.01). There was evidence of less atrophy and degeneration in DS seen in both light and electron microscopy. Dependent t test analysis using the normal contralateral muscle groups as the control showed that twitch contraction time was maintained within normal limits by stimulation whereas in the unstimulated group prolongation of twitch time occurred (p $&lt;$ 0.004). The electrical resistance property of the stimulated muscle was also preserved when compared to the normal control (p = 0.7) but did differ between D and N (p $&lt;$ 0.04). Although trends in the data suggested beneficial functional effects of ES, statistical analysis failed to support differences between the stimulated and unstimulated groups in functional testing.

This foundation, based on Aristotle's phronesis or practical wisdom, contains elements of the lived human experience which are seen as essential aspects of ethical, as well as medical, deliberation. The Aristotelian intellectual virtues of theoria and phronesis, used as "ideal types" of rationality, provide epistemological prejudices that structure two distinct ways of thinking. With this distinction, an alternative to certain dominant trends within biomedical ethics arises as phronesis provides more human centered prejudices for understanding. In conclusion, we shall see, using the doctrine of informed consent, that a phronetic rationality allows different, more humane meanings to come into being. Phronesis, it will be argued, provides a mode of rationality which promotes compassion and engagement in both ethics and medicine and consequently, is the more appropriate way of thinking in these important human practices.</description><creator>Goldstein, Daniel M.

Fatimah, the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad, is one such example. It is, however, a point of interest in her case is that in the twentieth century she has captured the attention of writers of Muslim religious literature to such an extent that there now exist at least eleven fairly recent biographies of her in Urdu, English, Arabic and Persian. This is remarkable, given that the earliest sources of Islamic history contain only a minimal amount of information on her. These modern biographies present Fatimah in a manner which interweaves historical information with hagiographic accounts, thus reinforcing her status as a saint. This thesis attempts to identify, from the earliest available sources, the details concerning Fatimah as a historical person but ultimately shows that there is little real evidence for her life and even what facts do exist are the subject of controversy. Following this it examines the growth of the hagiographical tradition which created out of her a true Muslim saint and discusses its significance particularly for the Shi'ah. Finally, the conclusion presents some of the possible reasons for Fatimah's exalted status and for the resurgence of interest in her in the context of the modern Islamic world.</description><creator>Ali, Rukhsana</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Shiite literature -- History and criticism</subject><subject>Fāṭimah, d. 632 or 3 -- In literature.</subject><title>The images of Fāṭimah in Muslim biographical literature</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8s45qb93n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j098zd261</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Islamic Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mp48sf73p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:12:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>As Mennonites take up the challenge to clarify their stance vis a vis the creation, the question arises as to whether there are dimensions or tendencies in the writings of their eponym that can assist them in the articulation of a theology that is world-affirming. The teachings of Menno Simons regarding the Incarnation, "the world" and "the flesh" reflect the ambivalent attitude toward the world which has characterized the Christian Church over the centuries. In his doctrine of regeneration, however, there is evident a profound hope concerning the possibilities for "this world". His commitment to a faith which transforms life in this world supports a "worldly" theology, and his insistence on a certain separation of the church is necessary if the church is to be for the world.</description><creator>Reesor, Rachel H.

The major impetus suggested for this development are the writings of Wilhelm Worringer, although the aesthetics of the Munich avant garde must also be credited. I have traced the evolution of Klee's thought through an examination of his diaries, letters and other documents of the period. It is clear that a demonstrable change occurs in Klee's concept of art as a result of his exposure to Worringer and the Blaue Reiter. This evolution is visible in his creative production.</description><creator>Lees, Carol Anne</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Klee, Paul, 1879-1940</subject><subject>Worringer, Wilhelm, 1881-1965</subject><title>Klee and Worringer : elective affinities in an aesthetic partnership</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pk02cd022.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qj72p928t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Art History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:02870z06c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:12:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><creator>Lomaliza, Kanda</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Insect rearing.</subject><subject>Feeds -- Research.</subject><subject>Edible insects.</subject><title>An insect-food reactor for human food supply</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/12579v41m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/02870z06c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Agricultural Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hd76s226d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:12:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Byzantine religious manuscripts were commissioned by people from many levels of society. Several contain portraits of their commissioners, represented together with a holy figure. An analysis of these scenes, examining features such as the holy figures represented and their specific iconographic meaning, and the relation of mortal to divine, reveals many facets of Byzantine art, religion and society. This analysis indicates a major distinction between portraits representing the emperor, and those depicting all other patrons. Non-imperial portraits show deep personal devotion and piety. The manuscripts in which they occur were commissioned to honour the holy figure, and many request salvation in return. Imperial commissions, on the other hand, were not votive gifts. Their portraits stress the public, political, and occasionally religious role of the emperor as the elected of God upon earth, and head of state. These portraits are thus highly informative of several aspects of Byzantine life.</description><creator>Franses, Henri</creator><date>1987</date><subject>Christian art and symbolism -- Byzantine Empire</subject><subject>Emperors -- Byzantine Empire.</subject><subject>Illumination of books and manuscripts, Byzantine</subject><subject>Benefactors -- Byzantine Empire</subject><title>Portraits of patrons in Byzantine religious manuscripts.</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2v23vw12w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hd76s226d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Art History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1544br56g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:12:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><creator>Webster, William Mark</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Novikov, Nikolaĭ Ivanovich, 1744-1818.</subject><subject>Russia -- Intellectual life -- 18th century</subject><subject>Freemasonry -- Russia -- History -- 18th century</subject><title>Novikov, freemasonry and the Russian enlightenment</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h702q841s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1544br56g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jd472z49b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:12:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><creator>Iton, Richard</creator><date>1987</date><subject>African Americans -- Suffrage</subject><subject>United States -- Race relations</subject><subject>African Americans -- Politics and government</subject><title>Political ideology and the black American community</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c534fr01n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jd472z49b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sb397b36p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:12:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Integral (holistic) and separable (analytic) processing were studied in ADD-H and normal children using restricted classification tasks composed of separable dimensions and triad/tetrad combinations. In Studies One and Three classifications of ADD-H children and controls were compared on size/brightness and length/density combinations. In Study Two classifications of four age groups of normal subjects (mean ages 5-3, 7-9, 11-1 years and adults) were compared on size-brightness combinations. ADD-H children demonstrated significantly fewer separable responses than normal controls only on the tetrads. Normal subjects showed a developmental trend towards differential separable responding to size as compared to brightness. ADD-H children appear to show a lag of about two years on this developmental trend. Results suggest that ADD-H children resort more readily than normals to integral responding under increased processing load. Results are discussed in terms of the cognitive deficits of ADD-H children and current theories of perceptual differentiation.</description><creator>Amin, Kiran</creator><date>1987</date><subject>Perception in children</subject><subject>Cognition disorders in children</subject><subject>Attention in children</subject><subject>Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.</subject><title>Separate integral responding in children demonstrating attention deficit disorder</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wm117r004.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sb397b36p</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:v118rg57z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:12:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis presents a study conducted to investigate the feasibility of using the existing Les Resources Camchib mill facilities to treat a new gold--copper ore called S-3. Analysis of the S-3 ore indicated that copper exists as chalcopyrite and that gold as free gold or in association with sulphides. The S-3 ore typically contains 0.3% copper and from 3.0 to 5.5 g/t gold. The study involved both laboratory and plant testing. Four routes were investigated to treat the S-3 ore: flotation with the present circuit and reagents, flotation with the present circuit and new reagents, flotation at natural pH in a slightly modified circuit, and direct cyanidation. Alkaline pH flotation in the existing mill circuit with Aero 3477 and Xanthate 343 as collectors (the second route) gave the most promising copper and gold recoveries. A Laboratory locked cycle test indicated that a copper concentrate grading 18.4% Cu with 89.4% gold and 94.9% copper recovery can be obtained. Plant flotation test yielded a copper concentrate grading 16.9% Cu with 82.0% gold and 95.7% copper recoveries. The plant results were obtained using gravity circuit tail as the flotation feed. If recovery of coarse free gold in the gravity circuit is taken into account, the overall gold recovery is 87%.</description><creator>Wibisono, Andri S.
