After the Ascension, the Father, in Christ's Name, sent the Spirit to be with the Church. The witness of the Spirit to Christ is made to the world through the Church, which He guides, teaches, and sanctifies. The Church is open to all peoples.

Either or both of these experiences may be illusion but, in the first analysis,he must accept both as real. The modern exponents of some scientifio theories which deny the existence of freedom would do well to remember that men of unquestionable intelligence, such as the medieval scholar Shankara, have accepted man's freedom and denied his world. There is no a priori justification for denying one whileaffiraing the other.[...]</description><creator>Hoffman, John. C.</creator><contributor>Boorman, J.

Studies on swelling of clay can yield results which are of value to a basic understanding of the behaviour of clay under compression. While the following experiments deal primarily with montmorillonite, most of the concepts will hold for any swelling clay. Good agreement of measured swelling with swelling calculated from osmotic forces of repulsion has been obtained for montmorillonite saturated with monovalent ions, the lack of agreement when the ions are divalent raises interesting questions.</description><creator>Hoekstra, Pieter.</creator><contributor>Warkentin, B.

If the person suffering damage cannot establish such relationship one of the main conditions for receiving compensation is unfulfilled. In this study, however, the expression "cause of damage" has another causal relation in view. It concerns the chain of causation leading up to the phenomenon, for example an accident, which is the established cause of the damage.</description><creator>Hjalsted, Finn.</creator><contributor>Rosevear, A.

This war seems to be the core or backbone of the moral allegory of the poem, despite the fact that the relationship to Aristotle has received rather more critical attention. In accordance with this belief, I shall be treating the figures of the poem as if they were intended to be more or less realistic representations of human beings, not abstract figures whom we are supposed to identity completely with the nominal virtue tor which they stand and fight.</description><creator>Heppner, Christopher.

However, the exploitation of the forests for the manufacture of pulp and paper is relatively recent. For only in the 1860's were commercial methods for making pulp from wood developed. Prior to this, a pulp and paper industry had been growing in a small way, but based on cotton and rags. Information on this early development is very scanty.</description><creator>Hayes, Francis.

One of the most promising lines of research for this problem seems to be in the field of physiological studies, in which the affects of infection on the metabolism of a host plant are studied. In most cases, metabolic studies which have been carried out on the nature of disease had to be performed on detached organs, detachment of which prevents the movement of materials in and/or out or the organ from taking place, i.e. prevents translocation.</description><creator>Hampson, Michael.

Rainfall rates observed at a point in the path of a storm approximate those along a section through the storm; this is the basis in estimating attenuation frequencies at 3.2 cm wavelength for a summer’s storms at Montreal. It has been found that attenuation along a radar path increases with increasing target intensity: expected attenuation over a 30 mi path at 3 mm hr-1 is 3 db, at 80 mm hr- 1 is 14 db. Power can overcome the limitations imposed by attenuation upon the radar as an indicator of the presence or absence of precipitation. But quantitative observations are difficult; and so attenuation gravely limits the 3.2 cm wavelength radar in a role as a severe-storm indicator.</description><creator>Hamilton, Paul.

He pointed out that factors come into play which result from haemorrhage but cannot be corrected by transfusion. This concept was reiterated by Moyer who made the point that death and morbidity in severe hypovolemic shock is undoubtedly due to a lack of perfusion of vital organs but that simple replacement of fluids is not enough to renew this flow.</description><creator>Hakstian, Robert.
