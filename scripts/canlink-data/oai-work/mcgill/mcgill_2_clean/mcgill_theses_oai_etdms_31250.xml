experimental models: (1) mutant mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), which develop pro-B cells but no pre-B and B cells; (2) SCID/myc transgenic mice having expanded pro-B cell populations, but no pre-B and B cells; (3) x-irradiated C3H/HeJ mice during early stages in the regeneration of pro-B cells in bone marrow seeded from a shielded marrow site. The in vivo localization of B220$ sp+$ cells was revealed by the binding of i.v. injected $ sp{125}$I-mAb 14.8 detected by light and electron microscope radioautography of femoral marrow sections. Many B220$ sp+$ pro-B cells were located in peripheral regions of SCID and SCID/myc bone marrow, often in clusters, associated with an electron dense extracellular matrix and with the processes of stromal reticular cells. Many B220$ sp+$ cells were associated with macrophages which contained numerous ingested bodies. Macrophage associations were more numerous in SCID/myc than in SCID mice, especially in the peripheral marrow regions. 3-5 day post-irradiation endocolonizing marrow contained increasing numbers of B220$ sp+$ cells in subosteal and peripheral regions, situated both within sinusoids and extravascularly, associated with stromal reticular cell processes and often close to nerve fibers. The results demonstrate that early B220$ sp+$ precursors begin to differentiate in peripheral marrow regions and develop intimate associations with reticular cells and macrophages. These findings suggest that through these associations, the bone marrow reticular cells promote the early development of the B cell lineage, while the bone marrow macrophages play a role in the elimination of aberrant precursor B cells.</description><creator>Manoukian, Raffi</creator><contributor>Osmond, D.

Three subject groups, athletes, normal sedentary subjects and chronic obstructive diseased patients were studied during progressive exercise testing to exhaustion on a cycle ergometer. Subjects rated dyspnea on a Borg Scale. Inspiratory flow, esophageal/gastric pressures and rib cage/abdominal displacements were measured. Subjects demonstrated two patterns of dyspnea response to changes in esophageal (pleural) pressure. All athletes, two normals and five patients were termed "low dyspnea responders", (LDR), whereas the remaining subjects were termed "high dyspnea responders", (HDR). LDR demonstrated large, rapid negative gastric pressure swings, coupled with outward abdominal displacement during early inspiration when compared to HDR, suggesting that LDR utilized abdominal muscle relaxation at the onset of inspiration. This mechanism appears to provide an extra inspiratory force, contributing to the increasing pleural pressures required. This breathing pattern appears to diminish the sensation of dyspnea at a given pleural pressure.</description><creator>Burke, Susan P. (Susan Patricia)</creator><contributor>Grassino, A. E.

TGF-$ beta$ is a potential mediator of placental trophoblast functions, including differentiation, hormone production, endometrial invasion and immunosuppression. Trophoblast cells are the epithelial-like covering of the chorionic villae at the fetal-maternal interface. In this study equilibrium binding assays and functional assays were used to investigate the binding characteristics and the actions of the TGF-$ beta$1 and TGF-$ beta$2 isoforms on an established human choriocarcinoma trophoblastic cell line, BeWo. Equilibrium saturation experiments indicated that the BeWo cells exhibited similar average affinities and total number of binding sites for TGF-$ beta$1 and TGF-$ beta sb2$. The K$ sb{ rm D}$ values obtained from Scatchard analyses were approximately 65 pM for $ sp{125}$I-TGF-$ beta$1 and 40 pM for $ sp{125}$I-TGF-$ beta$2, with 70,000 and 85,000 sites per cell respectively. Competitive equilibrium experiments indicated that TGF-$ beta$1 and TGF-$ beta$2 were equipotent (apparent half maximal inhibition (IC$ sb{50}$) $ sp sim70$ pM) and that all binding sites were capable of recognizing both isoforms. Two frequently used functional assays to determine dose responsiveness to TGF-$ beta$ isoforms were investigated with BeWo cells. A $ sp3$H-thymidine incorporation assay was used to measure TGF-$ beta$ effects and this indicated that neither TGF-$ beta$1 nor TGF-$ beta$2 had any significant effect on BeWo cells. The synthesis of an ECM protein, fibronectin, was monitored using both gelatin-Sepharose affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation with anti-human fibronectin polyclonal antibodies. However, neither TGF-$ beta$1 nor TGF-$ beta$2 had any effect on fibronectin synthesis in BeWo cells as measured by these two methods.

Viral neutralization antibodies were demonstrated against HTLV$ sb{ rm IIIb}$ virus while titers of circulating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) antibodies were measured against the HIV-1 envelope protein, gp120, using the vaccinia virus expression system which has been successfully used to express foreign viral proteins in target cells. Virologic (viral isolation) and immunologic (CD4$ sp+$ cells) parameters were also monitored pre and post antiviral therapy. The results indicate that patients receiving zidovudine for 36 weeks, have a diminished anti-HIV-1-ADCC directing antibody response, while the levels of these antibodies in patients receiving ribavirin or placebo remain constant. The titers of neutralizing antibodies and CD4 counts remain stable regardless of the treatment except for patients receiving ribavirin, where a decline in CD4 cells is observed. The decrease in the HIV-1 specific ADCC during zidovudine treatment parallels with the decrease in the amount of viral burden. This suggests that the two effects are somehow correlated. The impact of a washout period was also assessed. An increase in viral burden during cessation of AZT was reported which may reflect the inability of the treated host to mount a rapid immune response. As a consequence, this may lead to the deterioration of the immune status and the progression of the disease. The implications of these findings will be discussed in this study.</description><creator>Belmonte, Antonietta</creator><contributor>Dascal, Andre (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</subject><title>The effects of antiviral therapy on the levels of neutralizing antibodies and antibodies mediating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in HI-1 seropositive patients /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cz30pt842.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5x21tg57j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nv9354240</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:24:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The combination of pretransplant donor specific transfusion (DST) and cyclosporin (Cys) has proven to be an effective mode of immunomodulation in numerous allograft models. Our experiments were designed to study the effect of clinically applicable protocols using DST and low-dose cyclosporin in an heterotopic, fully allogenic model of small bowel transplantation in the rat. A 1 ml systemic DST 24 hours pretransplant with Cys (10 mg/kg day $-$1, 5 mg/kg POD 0 to 7, 2.5 mg/kg POD 8 to 14) was shown to be more effective than DST or Cys alone in prolonging graft survival (p $&lt;$ 0.05). Adding successive post-transplant DST (POD 7,14,21) had no effect on graft survival. Portal transfusion and Cys was the most effective mode of antigen presentation (p = 0.01 vs systemic DST), with 33% of the animals having prolonged survival. Adding successive post-transplant DST was deleterious to the portal DST effect. The adjunct of anti-lymphocyte serum to the DST-Cys combination was ineffective.</description><creator>Fecteau, Annie</creator><contributor>Guttman, Frank M.

This 38-40 amino acid polypeptide is derived from a larger precursor known as beta-amyloid precursor protein (BAPP). In this thesis the expression of this precursor in cultured human fibroblasts obtained from Alzheimer's patients and age-matched controls is examined at the mRNA and protein level. Using the technique of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, human fibroblasts were found to express BAPP transcripts encoding 770, 751, 714, and 695 amino acids. In immunocytochemical studies employing a monoclonal antibody to BAPP, this precursor was determined to be associated with the intermediate filament network. As well, on Western blots, aside from the bands of predicted molecular weights, a Triton-soluble 57 kDn band was detected. These findings lend support to the theory that aside from its putative extracellular functions, BAPP may play a vital intracellular role.</description><creator>Dooley, Nora P.</creator><contributor>Durham, Heather Dale (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Analysis of beta-amyloid precursor protein in Alzheimer's fibroblasts</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zc77sr30n.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cc08hg737</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fq977w257</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:24:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>As early as the 18th century, the Ottoman provinces, of which the Beylik of Tunis was one, entered into a period of decline from which the West emerged the principal beneficiary. These circumstances forced the Regency of Tunis to redefine itself a redefinition which initially took the shape of military reforms. If it is true that this restructuring was a reply to the nascent imperialism of the West, it is also true that it has a context within the relations which Tunis maintained with Istanbul. In order to understand these reforms one must examine them in the light of the internal evolution of the Tunisian military institutions. Therefore, following a review of the literature on the subject, chapter 2 surveys the relations of the Beylik of Tunis with the West and with the Sublime Porte, while chapters 3 and 4 describe, respectively, the military institutions before the reforms and the military reforms themselves.</description><creator>Erraïs, Sophie</creator><contributor>Turgay, A.

A review of fractal geometry, multifractal formalism and multiplicative cascades is offered. The importance of the Legendre transformation in multifractal formalism is highlighted, especially for multifractal spectrums which are not convex or twice differentiable. By reconsidering the scaling assumption $N sb{p}( alpha$) d$ alpha$ = $ sigma( alpha) rho sp{-f( alpha)} d alpha$, we show that subsets of a measure may offer a different multifractal spectrum. A gradation of self-similarity and scaling vis-a-vis canonicity is offered. Localized and generalized correlations are introduced, and two-point correlations are revisited for multiplicative cascades. A three-point correlation function is presented and discussed. The presence of an integral scale is shown to produce a more involved correlation scaling behaviour.</description><creator>Matte, Robert</creator><contributor>Warn, Thomas (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Mathematics.</subject><subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</subject><title>Correlations and multifractal measures</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k0698869d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/37720f02t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sj139317r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:24:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The poetical works of Paul Morin are not very well known, and are rarely ever read today. And yet, he was the successor of Emile Nelligan and Albert Lozeau. Paul Morin is one of the first French Canadians to publish his works in France and it was said of his collection of poems Le Paon d'email that it was the spark that ignited the famous "Querelle des regionalistes et des exotiques" in French Canada. Unfortunately, the negative reactions of some of his first critics, were to determine for a long time those of future generations. This thesis focuses on the critical reception of Paul Morin's first two published books: Le Paon d'email (1911) and Poemes de cendre et d'or (1922), and attempts as well to retrace their critical fortunes up until the beginning of the sixties.</description><creator>David, Lucie</creator><contributor>Ricard, Francois (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Morin, Paul, 1889- -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><title>La fortune critique de Paul Morin, 1908-1958 /</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3n2040408.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sj139317r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0z708x912</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:24:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study discusses the establishment of Persatuan Ulama Seluruh Aceh (All Aceh Ulama Association) by a few forward-looking Acehnese 'ulama's and the role that this organization played in educational reforms in Aceh. The educational reforms are discussed in two ways: (1) The actual change in the educational system of the madrasa, and the establishment of a teachers' training school Normal Islam Instituut. (2) The socio-religious changes that contributed to the success of the educational revolution in Aceh. The thesis discusses the educational changes made by Persatuan Ulama Seluruh Aceh and the impact they had on Aceh during the 1930's and indirectly on modern Aceh.</description><creator>Latif, Hamdiah A.</creator><contributor>Adams, Charles J.

The underlying pelitic sediments are made out of series of silt and clay microlaminations ($ approx$1 mm), separated by thin layers (2 to 5 mm) of fine sand (2 $&lt;$ $ phi$ $&lt;$ 3) originating either from ice rafted materials or turbid flows along the bottom during the spring thaw. Variations in the size composition of the material entering the estuary or fluctuations in currents during tidal cycles, could explain the formation of the series of microlaminations. At present, the circulation pattern of the residual current is modulated by the fornightly tidal cycle. During the spring freshet, from mid-May to mid-June, the circulation pattern is altered, and the vector of the residual current is oriented upstream whereas it is usually oriented downstream. The solid discharges of the spring freshet (4,104 t.d$ sp{-1}$), neap tide (1,800 t.d$ sp{-1}$) and spring tide (2,592 t.d$ sp{-1}$), are sufficient to transport in 12 days, 28 days and 19 days respectively, the amount of sediment dredged annually in the riviere-du-Loup harbor (50 * 10$ sp3$ t). The TSM fluctuations are mainly controlled by the resuspension of sediments deposited during slack tide (2,250 t at neap tide and 3,735 t at spring tide). Advection of TSM from the MTZ explains the variations in turbidity observed on the outer edge of the platform. Downstream of the study area, fluctuations of turbidity are controlled by advection of a turbid plume located at the mouth of the riviere du Loup.</description><creator>Lorrain, Stéphane</creator><contributor>d'Anglejan, Bruno (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Geology.</subject><title>Stratigraphie et dynamique sédimentaire de la plate-forme infra-littorale de Rivière-du-Loup; estuaire du Saint-Laurent</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0r967495v.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wm117q173</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geological Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zp38wd983</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:24:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A methodology was developed in this study for identifying the cognitive, pedagogical, and computational characteristics of computer-based learning environments. The characterization of the cognitive and pedagogical features was achieved by decomposing the learning environments into episodes which were composed of sequences of "views". Each "view" was described in terms of the different types of knowledge presented, the pedagogical strategies used to present the knowledge, and the forms and functions of user-computer interactions elicited. The computational characteristics were described in terms of modularity and other programming properties. The methodology was applied to characterizing the instructional programs produced by student teachers using Logo. The results showed that this methodology can successfully identify the cognitive, pedagogical and computational characteristics of the learning environments. It can also clarify what can be learned in a microworld, especially the "powerful ideas" in Logo environments. In addition, the usability and constraints of learning environments in meeting the learners' cognitive needs during the learning process can be assessed.</description><creator>Chen, Mei, 1962-</creator><contributor>Cartwright, Glenn (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Groen, Guy (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Breuleux, Alain (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Computer-assisted instruction -- Evaluation.</subject><subject>LOGO (Computer program language)</subject><subject>Computer-assisted instruction -- Programming.</subject><subject>Human-computer interaction.</subject><title>The characterization of learning environments and program structures of instructional programs produced using Logo /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b8515p50r.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zp38wd983</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):31275</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
