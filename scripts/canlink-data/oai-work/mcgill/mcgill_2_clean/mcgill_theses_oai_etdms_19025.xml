He had no instrument for measuring blood pressure and based his deductions on the gross pathological changes observed in patients dying of dropsy. As a result of the development of instruments for measuring blood pressure and improvements in microscopic technique, correlations were made between elevation of blood pressure, thickening of the walls of the arterioles and hypertrophy of the left ventricle of the heart.</description><creator>Weigensberg, Bernard.

The need for the study arose indirectly through the Laboratory of Forest Pathology, Canada Department of Agriculture at Saskatoon. Members of that laboratory, while investigating root diseases of white spruce in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, discovered root – wounding by the larvae of this insect. Since it was thought that there might be a relationship between this wounding and the incidence of disease, a co-operative study of the insect and root diseases of white spruce was undertaken.</description><creator>Warren, George.

Of necessity, idealized sections have been assumed in the determination of the various theories which govern the action of a soil. However, in the field all the local vagaries of nature come into play and the resulting heterogeneous mass is difficult to analyse and inconsistent in its properties.  Thus, the field or soil mechanics has seen two parallel paths utilized in its development. The theoretical path has led to a fuller understanding of the stresses and strains which affect the soil; but the rigorous application of these theories has not proved completely satisfactory in the field.</description><creator>Townsend, David.

During the early stages of gas turbine investigation and design, recognition was given to the special problems likely to be encountered in the development of the combustion chamber. The present state of development has been accomplished largely by empirical means. Results of any change of operating conditions required "trial and error" design and testing with little margin for satisfactory prediction. Data obtained from experimental results and early combustion chamber design schemes has been supplemented by combustion research programs, and many successful designs have resulted.</description><creator>Sullivan, Lorne.

In the aperture, electric and magnetic fields are determined, both in the E and H-planes, for effective apertures, varying in diameter from 5 to 8. Field patterns in the Fresnel region are taken for horns, having mouth diameters of 5 and 8. Measurements are given, as well, for a square horn, of aperture 8 to a side, under TEIO excitation. Deviations, from the field values in a horn of infinite length, occur in the electromagnetic field in front of the horn and in the aperture. These deviations are ascribed to diffraction, and to the possible existence of higher modes. Similar pertubation patterns in the aperture are obtained for conical horns, whose diameters differ by 2. Some Fresnel field measurements are compared with calculations, by the method of Kirchhoff and by Lommel. If the correct variation in the incident field is taken into account, favourable agreement is obtained, for patterns sufficiently far from the aperture. Results are in terms of Lommel's universal co-ordinates.</description><creator>Shkarofsky, Issie.</creator><contributor>Howes, F.

It is during this saprophytic part of its life cycle that the fungus passes through it s sexual stage.

Studies of the structure of the arterial wall and of the structural changes occurring during the development of atherosclerotic lesions have been relatively neglected. Atherosclerosis is, however, a focal disease. In studying the pathogenesis of the lesions, and in attempting to account tor their localization, one must consider not only the composition and pressure of the fluid bathing and passing into the arterial wall, but also, obviously, the structure of the wall itself.</description><creator>Rota, Alexander.

Results may be summarized as follows: (a) The approximate method of temperature analysis shows good agreement with more exact methods. A cooled and protected tube sheet for high temperature service was analyzed by the technique. (b) A correlation was obtained for heat transfer in turbulent now in the entrance length of tubes which predicts much higher coefficients than those formed by other workers.

Although much success has been achieved at various periferal synapses, no chemical transmitter at the G.N.S. synapses has definitely been discovered or proven. The complexity of the G.N.S. is such that many supposedly similar experiments give conflicting results. One explanation for these conflicting results obtained when dealing with the G.N.S. would be that there is probably more than one synaptic transmitter, and that a substance may be excitatory at one synapse but inhibitory at another.</description><creator>Pedley, Norah.

From its particular geographic location it was destined to occupy a position of dominance in the growth of Canada.  The peculiar physiographic features of the St. Lawrence River on the South and Mount Royal on the North have given the direction fo the city growth its own particular form.  The phenomenon of th4e two nationalities, diverse in language, traditions, religion and culture, living side by side and paying allegiance to a common sovereign has marked the city with an atmosphere that adds to its own natural charms.  With the majority French speaking people carrying on their own particular life and the English residents developing their own culture the city has been justly termed the Paris of America.

Since Braconnot, in 1820, hydrolysed gelatin with dilute sulfuric acid, proteins have been hydrolysed with acids at concentrations as high as sixteen normal. Hydrolysis has also been effected by heating proteins with barium hydroxide solutions or other alkalies and by incubating them with pancreatic and other proteolytic enzymes.</description><creator>Pedersen, Jorgen.

A great many investigations of both in anatomical and clinical nature have contributed to our present day knowledge of the subject. But considerable diversity both of opinion and description is revealed in these contributions. Actually, only a few investigators have taken the subject really to task; partially, this may be due to the difficulty of dissection in the region, and clinically because suppuration in this region is often diffuse and obscures the boundaries of the fascial spaces.</description><creator>Mohiuddin, Syed.

The measured fields and those predicted by some recent theories are compared for plane waves irradiating the screen at normal incidence, using apertures from one-quarter to two wavelengths in diameter. Several measurements for non-normal incidence are included. Experimental techniques have been devised for the measurement of the aperture fields very close to the diffracting edge. A sharp increase in the magnitude of some of the field components has been observed to occur in the region less than 0.15 wavelengths from the edge. This result supports recent theoretical predictions.</description><creator>Milne, Allen. R.</creator><contributor>Woonton, G.

In these experiments, Hall heated a number of rocks in a furnace that was used for making bricks. The temperature was measured by means or a resistance thermometer (the first of its kind) which was constructed by Wedgwood. Hall found that hornblende and other mafic minerals were the first to melt when the rocks were heated. These minerals vitrified at moderate heat but the feldspar remained unchanged.</description><creator>McCuaig, James. A.</creator><contributor>Kranck, E.

Measurements were made at three different conductor spacings with line lengths varying from one-quarter wavelength up to four wavelengths. With a probable error of about 5% it was found that the radiation resistance was independent of line length and was very nearly proportional to the square of both frequency and conductor separation. Unlike the radiation resistance for lines composed of thin circular conductors, the magnitude of the radiation resistance for strip lines with short circuit terminations was found to be considerably greater than that for strip lines with open circuit terminations.</description><creator>Matusiak, Marvin.
