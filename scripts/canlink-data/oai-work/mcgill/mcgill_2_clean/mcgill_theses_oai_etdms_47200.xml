The clincial method which he has applied in this fie1d is analyzed and tentatively accepted as a new approach to child study. The central hypothesis of the author is that child thought is qualitatively different from that of the adult: he calls this thought "ego-centric". The author postulates that ego-centric thought is incommunicable because it is not socialized and that it evolves in accordance with the growing need into the logical thought of the adult. This ego-centrism results in transductive reasoning, intellectual and moral realism and pre-causality. These doctrines are found to be biased by the conditions of the experiment, the choice of subjects and the emphasis on the social factor at the expense of physical experience.

This will makepossible the calculation of the current which will flow in any branch circuit due to a difference of potential applied between the ends. The impedances must be expressed in terms of resistances and reactances in order to determine the phase relationships between the voltages impressed and the currents produced.

Early chemistry, indeed, concerned itself entirely with the properties of matter, and methods for effecting its transformation. Soon, however, attention was focused on the actual mechanism of reaction and it was found necessary to consider not onlymaterial changes, but accompanying energy changes.
