Establishing  analogical guidelines and putting them to the test is the main aim of the thesis.  Towards this end, I discuss the philosophical foundations of analogical reasoning in  planetary geomorphology and posit rules of use that facilitate the evaluation of  analogical hypotheses. Subsequently, I present four hypotheses concerning aeolian,  fluvial and periglacial processes on Mars. Each of these hypotheses is evaluated in  terms of the analogical rules presented. The fourth hypothesis is original to this  thesis and suggests that a periglacial landscape comprising pingos and small-scale  polygonal ground exists in an impact crater located in northwest Utopia  Planitia.</description><creator>Soare, Richard J.</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Planetary landforms</subject><subject>Analogy</subject><subject>Reasoning</subject><subject>Mars (Planet) -- Surface</subject><subject>Mars (Planet) -- Geology</subject><subject>Pingos</subject><title>The restructuring of analogical reasoning in planetary science /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nv935355s.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xp68kg880</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bc386j78r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Total body fat and muscle mass depletion has been reported in  some patients with COPD. This study used simple anthropometric measurements to  compare the body composition of patients with moderate-severe COPD to that of  healthy controls, and examines relationships between body composition, disease  severity, habitual physical activity and resting and exercise energy expenditure.  Results show no significant differences in overall Heath-Carter somatotype  characteristics, percent body fat, fat free mass and girth measurements between COPD  and control subjects although when stratified by gender, female COPD patients  exhibited a greater body fat component. Measured VO2 (L/min) at rest or during  steady-state exercise was not significantly different between COPD and control  subjects despite a higher exercise ventilation in patients. Neither resting or  exercise energy expenditure was related to body composition, however it was related  to DLCO/VA (ml·min-1·mmHg -1·L-1). Findings from  this study suggest that COPD patients capable of participating in dynamic exercise  studies do not exhibit total body fat and muscle depletion. Findings in women  suggest that the relative decrease in FFM may be related to a relatively higher  proportion of body fat and not a decrease in absolute muscle mass.</description><creator>Rittmaster, Dana</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Body composition</subject><subject>Lungs -- Diseases, Obstructive -- Patients</subject><title>Anthropometric, clinical and lifestyle determinants of exercise energy expenditure in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2b88qc72t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bc386j78r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3f462602c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The solubility of molybdenum trioxide in liquid-undersaturated  water vapour has been investigated experimentally at 300, 320, and 360°C and  48 to 163 bars. Results of these experiments show that the solubility of MoO3 in the  vapour phase is between 1 and 23 ppm, which is 19-20 orders of magnitude higher than  that in a water-free system. Molybdenum solubilities increase linearly with fH2O ,  indicating that the metal forms a gaseous hydrated complex of the type  MoO3·nH2O by the reaction: MoO3g+nH 2Og=MoO3· nH2Og A1 The  hydration number, n, is interpreted to have a value of 2.6 at 300ºC, 2.5 at  320ºC, and 3.0 at 360ºC. Values of log K for this reaction are 16.9  at 300ºC, 16.5 at 320ºC, and 12.5 at 360ºC. Calculations based on the extrapolated solubility of MoO 3 in  equilibrium with molybdenite at 600ºC and 500 bars, using average H2O and  total S fluxes of actively degassing volcanoes, with fO2 and fS2 controlled by the  assemblage hematite-magnetite-pyrite, indicate that the vapour phase can transport  sufficient Mo in about 900,000 years (within the life of some geothermal systems) to  form a deposit of 336 Mt, with an average grade of 0.087% Mo (e.g., the Endako  Mo-porphyry deposit, Canada).</description><creator>Rempel, Kirsten U.</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Geochemistry.</subject><title>The solubility and speciation of molybdenum in water vapour at elevated temperatures and pressures : implications for ore genesis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s1784m34x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3f462602c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:df65v848r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Earthworms are well known for their casting and burrowing  activities which improve soil structure and soil fertility. However, earthworm  populations in temperate regions exhibit patchy distribution in space and time. This  makes it difficult to predict how earthworm activities may influence paedogenesis  and nutrient cycling processes at the ecosystem level. The main objective of this  study was to determine the spatiotemporal dynamic of surface cast production of two  earthworm species, Aporrectodea turgida and Lumbricus terrestris, on the  row-interrow scale in a temperate soybean agroecosystem. Our observations  demonstrated that casting activity was synchronous with plant growth. More casts  were also found in the row intercepts compared to the interrow ones. Both the  spatial and temporal variations are thought to be caused by the microclimate found  under the plant canopy, verifying results from controlled laboratory studies that  show casting activity to be controlled by soil temperature and moisture. These  results suggest a possible mutualism between earthworm and plants in cultivated  temperate soybean agroecosystems, but this remained to be confirmed.</description><creator>Perreault, Jonathan M.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Soil structure.</subject><subject>Earthworms -- Ecology.</subject><subject>Soybean -- Ecology.</subject><title>Casting activity of Lumbricid earthworms from temperate agroecosystems</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9w0323616.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/df65v848r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:f7623d16q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In Salmonella typhimurium, PhoP is the response regulator of the  PhoP/PhoQ two-component regulatory system. Gel filtration chromatography showed that  PhoP exists as a mixture of monomer and dimer regardless of its phosphorylation  state. Unphosphorylated PhOPHis (a mutant harboring a histidine tag at the  C-terminus) was mostly monomeric, whereas PhoP His~P existed as a mixture of  monomer and dimer. Binding of PhoP to the PhoP box was barely influenced by  phosphorylation as determined by surface plasmon resonance. In contrast,  phosphorylation of PhoPHis induced a 200% increase in PhoPHis binding to target DNA.  Fluorescence analysis revealed that the conformation of PhOPHis is greatly altered  compared to that of wild-type PhoP. Altogether, these data show that a His tag at  the C-terminus of PhoP affects its biochemical properties, most likely by affecting  its conformation. More importantly, these results show that wild-type PhoP  dimerization and interaction with target DNA are independent of  phosphorylation.</description><creator>Perron-Savard, Philippe</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Biology, Microbiology.</subject><title>Activation of bacterial response regulators</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zs25x9174.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f7623d16q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hx11xf80w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>While most micrometeorological measurement techniques are only  suitable for windy conditions, the Nocturnal Boundary Layer Technique can be used to  measure trace gas flux during calm, clear nights as the nighttime stability enables  gas emitted at the ground to accumulate. The difference between two measurements  over the whole depth of this layer is believed to integrate emissions from a large  area representative of, in this study, an agricultural farm. A tethersonde and  infrared gas analyzer attached to a blimp carrying a bag sampling system monitored  atmospheric variables for each ascent during two summer field campaigns. A  mini-SODAR was installed in the field to obtain the wind flowfield. Strong  accumulation was observed under low level jets suggesting that this feature acts as  a good lid for trace gases. An average background vertical motion different from  zero seemed to have more influence on gas propagation than did intermittent  turbulence. On at least one night, a density current created by the nearby  St-Lawrence River was observed to influence measurements.</description><creator>Mathieu, Nathalie</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Boundary layer (Meteorology)</subject><subject>Greenhouse gases -- Measurement.</subject><title>A study of atmospheric properties and their impact on the use of the nocturnal boundary layer budget technique for trace gas measurement /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rf12d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hx11xf80w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5138jf33n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Recent studies using brain imaging have begun to reveal the  neural systems that underlie the response to drug cues in human addicts, however,  little is known about how they are affected by perceived drug availability and  degree of abstinence in the user. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRT)  and a cue reactivity paradigm in cigarette smokers, we have investigated, for the  first time, the neural correlates of expectancy and abstinence on the drug user's  response to stimuli associated with drug use. Exposure to smoking cues induced a  subjective craving response and elicited activation of a distributed neural system  involved in the cognitive and emotional processing of salient stimuli. We showed  that in a state of anticipation to smoke, this neural response was heightened,  notably in the prefrontal cortex, whereas it was absent during a state of  non-expectancy. In addition, we showed that this cue-induced response was disrupted  during acute withdrawal from smoking.</description><creator>McBride, Dharma T.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>The role of expectancy and abstinence in the neural response to smoking cues in cigarette smokers : an fMRI study</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j9602120t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5138jf33n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h989r3709</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Side-effect analysis gives information about the set of  locations that a statement may read or modify. This analysis can provide information  useful in a compiler for performing aggressive optimizations. The impact of the use  of side-effect analysis in compiler optimizations has been studied for programming  languages such as Modula-3 and C, but no thorough investigation for Java has been  done. We present a study of whether side-effect information improves performance in  Java just-in-time (JIT) compilers, and if so, what level of analysis precision is  needed. We also analyze the optimizations and benchmarks that benefit most from  side-effect analysis. We used SPARK, the inter-procedural analysis component of the  SOOT Java analysis and optimization framework, to compute side-effect information  and encode it in class files. We modified Jikes RVM, a research JIT, to make use of  side-effect analysis in various local and global analyses and optimizations such as  local common sub-expression elimination, heap SSA, redundant load elimination and  loop-invariant code motion. On the SpecJVM98 benchmarks, we measured the static  number of memory operations removed, the dynamic counts of memory reads eliminated,  and the execution time. Our results show that the use of side-effect analysis increases  the number of static opportunities for load elimination by up to 98%, and reduces  dynamic field read instructions by up to 27%. Side-effect information enabled  speedups of up to 20% for some benchmarks. The main cause of the speedups is the use  of side-effect information in load elimination. Finally, among the different levels  of precision of side-effect information, a simple side-effect analysis is usually  sufficient to obtain most of these speedups.</description><creator>Le, Anatole</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Using inter-procedural side-effect information in JIT optimizations</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v405s9892.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h989r3709</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jm214p65s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Chromated copper arsenate (CCA), type C, was largely used as a  wood preservative due to its exceptional fungicidal and insecticidal properties.  Although this treatment was prohibited for residential purposes in Canada and in the  United-States of America, concerns about CCA-treated wood focus on the possible  threat on human health and the contamination of the environment, through the  leaching of metals from existing structures. The objectives of this thesis are (1)  to assess the effects of metals leached from CCA- and ACQ-treated wood on the  survival, the growth and the reproductive success of the earthworm Eisenia fetida  (Annelida, Oligochaeta), and (2) to evaluate if annetocin, a neuropeptide linked to  reproduction, could be used as a biomarker of ecotoxicological responses of the worm  E. fetida when exposed to metals from the CCA treatment.

In this  framework, the agent must explore the environment to gather more information about  the model and the utility of each of its actions, while striving to act as well as  possible using limited knowledge. One of the major obstacles that prevent  reinforcement learning from being extended to real-life settings is the fact that  the agent is blind to the risk of actions during learning, potentially ending up in  catastrophic states. This thesis presents a model-based directed exploration method  for selecting actions based on a measure of risk, characterized by entropy and  expected immediate reward. The weighted combination of this risk measure and the  long term utility of the action, or risk-adjusted utility, is used to determine the  probability of different actions. Using this approach, agents can manifest  risk-averse or risk-seeking behavior. Experimental results show that risk-directed  exploration can result in better performance during learning than the standard  Boltzmann action selection method, or other directed exploration methods such as  counter-based and recency-based methods.</description><creator>Law, Edith L.

Vitamin A  deficiency predisposes to certain cancers and it has since been discovered that  retinoids display antitumorigenic activity in many models. Keratinocytes with a null  mutation in the RARgamma and RARalphagamma genes are predisposed to tumorigenesis in  vivo. This outcome is reversed by the re-introduction of a functional RAR,  suggesting that some retinoid-target gene(s) are implicated in tumour formation in  this model. Suppressive subtractive hybridization techniques have been used to  isolate RA-responsive genes no longer regulated in RAR-null keratinocytes. This work  led to the cloning of gas3, a member of the growth arrest-specific gene family. Our  studies have demonstrated that gas3 expression is regulated by RA and is greatly  reduced following tumor promotion, indicating that this gene could potentially  inhibit epidermal tumorigenesis elicited by retinoids.</description><creator>Laforest, Brigitte</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>Isolation and characterization of RA-target genes from keratinocytes potentially involved in epithelial tumorigenesis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9g54xj20s.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sb397886g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8g84mm80c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Robots carrying tasks in an unknown environment often need to  build a map in order to be able to navigate. One approach is to create a detailed  map of the environment containing the position of obstacles. But this option can use  a large amount of memory, especially if the environment is large. Another approach,  closer to how people build a mental map, is the topological map. A topological map  contains only places that are easy to recognize (landmarks) and links them  together. In this thesis, we explore the issue of creating a topological  map from range data. A robot in a simulated environment uses the distance from  objects around it (range data) and a compass as inputs. From this information, the  robot finds intersections, classifies them as landmarks using a neural network and  creates a topological map of its environment. The neural network detecting landmarks  is trained online on sample intersections. Although the robot evolves in a simulated  environment, the ideas developed in this thesis could be applied to a real robot in  an office space.</description><creator>Künzle, Philippe</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Building topological maps for robot navigation using neural networks</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ft848r126.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8g84mm80c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:th83kz918</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) acting on Sertoli cells of  the testis plays important roles during reproductive development. FSH-R knockout  (FORKO) mice provide a model to examine alterations in testicular and epididymal  structure and function in its absence. Examination of the FORKO testis revealed a  gross alteration of Sertoli cell structure indicative of a fluid imbalance.  Functional parameters, such as ABP secretion were also significantly reduced in  FORKO testis. Morphometry revealed quantitative reductions in seminiferous tubule  size. The epididymal epithelium, appeared abnormal and morphometry revealed that  epididymal tubule size was reduced in the knockout. Computer Assisted Sperm Analysis  on sperm from the cauda epididymidis revealed significant alterations in parameters  corresponding to sperm motility as well as sperm counts.

The strategy for implementation of semistructured data in Aldat  system is to augment the data type and operations in the programming language,  jRelix. The functionalities of attribute metadata operators (eval, quote, transpose  ) have been enhanced and new operators (relation, typeof, self ) have been added.  The capacity of the wildcard has been magnified; therefore, it can represent  top-level relations or nested relations in domain algebra and relational algebra  depending on the context. The expansion of recursive virtual nested relations has  been implemented to support recursive nesting structure. Applications of these  operators also have been presented including attribute path and schema discovery,  data reorganization, and queries involving transitive closure on graphical  structured data.</description><creator>Guo, Fan, 1966-</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Implementing attribute metadata operators to support semistructured data</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d217qq092.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x346d4806</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3j333277g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The anterior pituitary gland is an essential endocrine organ.  The primordium of the anterior pituitary gland, Rathke's pouch, is formed by the  invagination of somatic ectoderm that lines the roof of the oral cavity. It has been  shown that SHH is important in pouch formation, but there is a controversy over  where the source of the signal is originating from the neural or oral  ectoderm. The objective of my project was to describe the expression  pattern and the role of Shh in the specification of Rathke's pouch in the chick  embryo. I analyzed the expression pattern of Pitx2 and Lim3 which are two  transcription factors required for pituitary development. Pitx2 was expressed  throughout Rathke's pouch and the oral ectoderm during pituitary formation. Lim3 was  expressed in Rathke's pouch, with stronger expression on the rostral side of the  pouch. Interfering with the SHH signalling pathway at the time of  development of cells that will form the hypophyseal placode altered the expression  patterns of Pitx2 and Lim3. This suggests that the SHH signal from the neural  ectoderm plays a role in pituitary patterning.

It occurs mostly in females, 80% of whom harbor mutations in  the DCX (Xg22.3-q23) gene. To determine whether males and females with SBH have a similar  clinical spectrum and genetic basis, we analyzed and compared the clinical, imaging,  and molecular features in 30 males and 60 previously reported females with  SBH. The range of clinical phenotypes in males with SBH overlapped  that in females. However, MRI studies revealed that some SBH subtypes such as  incomplete posterior SBH, diffuse SBH with posterior predominance and pachygyria-SBH  were more frequently or exclusively observed in males. Conversely, diffuse SBH and  diffuse SBH with anterior predominance were more frequent in females. The  preponderance in males of either the mildest or the most severe SBH subtypes  correlated with the overrepresentation of normal/borderline intelligence and severe  mental retardation respectively. Conversely, females who had SBH of intermediate  severity exhibited mostly mild or moderate mental retardation. Mutations in DCX were  detected in 33% of males; 8% had mutations of the LIS1 (17p13.3) gene and 4% a  partial trisomy of chromosome 9p. These studies demonstrate that SBH in males is a clinically and  genetically heterogeneous, mostly sporadic syndrome, and suggest other genetic  mechanisms such as mutations in the non-coding regions of the DCX or LIS1 genes;  functional, somatic or germline mosaicism; and mutations of other  genes.</description><creator>D'Agostino, Maria Daniela</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><title>Subcortical band heterotopia (SBH) in males : clinical, imaging and genetic findings in comparison with females</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9z903048v.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n009w284t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2514nm045</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Two processes may lead to genetic divergence among populations.  One is mediated by geography, whereby physical barriers and geographic distance  limit gene flow among populations, resulting in divergence due to drift or mutation.  Another is ecological speciation, whereby populations adapt to their local  environments via natural selection, and gene flow is impeded by selection against  dispersers in favor of adapted residents. I used natural populations of guppies  (Poecilia reticulata) to determine the relative influence of these two processes in  the structuring of populations. If geography is playing a strong role, I predicted  that gene flow would be greatly impeded by physical barriers and geographic  distance. If ecology is playing a strong role, I predicted that gene flow would  decrease with increasing strength of divergent selection among populations.  Specifically, I examined the relative roles of physical barriers, geographic  distance, predation, and various other habitat features (e.g. canopy cover, water  velocity) on the amount of gene flow among populations. I was thus able to determine  whether natural selection or decreased dispersal plays a greater role in the  reduction of gene flow. I found that physical barriers and geographic distance  played a large role in the regulation of gene flow among populations. Predation and  physical habitat features did not play a role in the reduction of gene flow. My  research clarifies the mechanisms involved in speciation and the production and  maintenance of biodiversity, important issues in conservation and evolutionary  biology.</description><creator>Crispo, Erika</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Natural selection -- Trinidad and Tobago</subject><subject>Guppies -- Adaptation -- Trinidad and Tobago</subject><subject>Guppies -- Trinidad and Tobago -- Geographical distribution</subject><title>Factors influencing gene flow in guppies</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6682x4537.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2514nm045</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9019s302s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Hes1 is a mammalian basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)  transcriptional repressor that inhibits neuronal differentiation and acts together  with the corepressor Gro/TLE. Hes1 interacts with Gro/TLE through its WRPW motif and  recruits Gro/TLE to specific DNA sites. In contrast, a related Hes family member,  Hes6, promotes neuronal differentiation. Little is known about the molecular  mechanisms underlying the neurogenic effect of Hes6. To address this question, a  structure/function analysis was performed to identify domains of Hes6 important for  its biological activity during the differentiation of cortical neurons. It is shown  here that the nuclear translocation of Hes6 is required to promote cortical  neurogenesis. However, Hes6 neurogenic activity does not appear to be DNA-binding  dependent, suggesting that it is mediated by protein-protein interaction mechanisms.  Moreover, a conserved potential PEST sequence present at the C-terminus of Hes6,  which may regulate protein turnover, is also important for the neurogenic activity  of Hes6. It is also shown that the nuclear translocation-incompetent form of Hes6  and, to a lesser extent, the PEST sequence-defective form have a reduced ability to  promote a proteolytic degradation of Hes1. This correlation suggests that Hes6 may  regulate cortical neurogenesis by a protein-protein interaction mechanism in which  Hes6 interacts with Hes1 and promotes a proteolytic degradation of the  latter.</description><creator>Bélanger Jasmin, Stéphanie</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Characterization of molecular mechanisms underlying the neurogenic effect of the bHLH protein Hes6</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n296wz62t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9019s302s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0r967424w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis, we introduce SableJIT, a retargetable  just-in-time compiler for the SableVM Java virtual machine. Our design attempts to  minimize the amount of work required to port (or to retarget) our compiler to a new  platform. We accomplish this in three ways. First, we introduce a retargetable  backend where the amount of work required to port it is reduced to the  implementation of simple well-defined primitive functions. Second, we keep all code  related to the internals of the virtual machine in the frontend, making knowledge of  the target architecture sufficient for a port. Finally, we provide a good  development environment that favours incremental development and testing, in part  through a robust runtime system that can recover from compilation  failures. We demonstrate the portability of SableJIT by supporting three  processor architectures and various operating systems. In particular, we describe  the experience acquired in porting our compiler to the Solaris/SPARC  platform.</description><creator>Bélanger, David, 1978-</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Sablejit : a retargetable just-in-time compiler</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9c67wn46p.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0r967424w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sj139250k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>By using sufficiently long prefix and orthogonal narrow-band  sub-carriers with adaptive bit loading, orthogonal frequency-division  multiple-access (OFDMA) can offer high bandwidth efficiency required for broadband  wireless access communications in frequency-selective fading channels. However, when  deep fading occurs in a frequency slot, it can create data loss in one or more  sub-carriers. Diversity techniques could be used to enhance the performance of OFDMA  in the presence of deep fades. The research presented in this thesis aims to provide diversity  in OFDMA for broadband wireless access communications in frequency-selective fading  channels. First, the diversity characteristics in OFDMA are examined to establish  the diversity equivalence in the time and frequency domains. Based on these  characteristics, suitable techniques to achieve the full diversity gain in OFDMA are  developed. When channel information is available to transmitters, a group-optimal  adaptive-tone-diversity OFDMA (GO-ATD-OFDMA) scheme that combines adaptive diversity  gain and bit loading, is proposed. It is shown that the GO-ATD-OFDMA can offer a  better performance than the conventional time-domain Rake receiver. In the case of  unavailable channel information, spreading is combined with diversity in the  proposed group-spreading OFDMA (GS-OFDMA) scheme to provide both diversity  protection and interference suppression. The GS-OFDMA has a comparable performance  to the group-orthogonal multi-carrier code-division multiple-access (GO-MC-CDMA)  scheme but with a reduced transmitted peak-to-average power ratio (PAR). Performance  of the proposed schemes in terms of error rates, spectral efficiency, achievable  system throughput, and computational complexity is investigated by analysis and  simulations.</description><creator>Xu, Ying Lin, 1975-</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>OFDMA schemes with diversity in frequency-selective fading channels</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2z10wq750.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sj139250k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n870zr26f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The management of software development processes is a continual  challenge facing software development organizations. Previous studies used  "flexible models" and empirical methods to optimize software development  processes. In this thesis, the expected payoff is used to quantitatively evaluate  processes. Payoff can be defined as the value of a team member's action, and the  expected payoff combines the value of the payoff of a team member's action and the  probability of taking that action. The mathematic models of a waterfall process and  two flexible processes are evaluated in terms of total maximum expected payoff.

The transmission system of this unit features a planetary  gear train and a ball-screw mechanism. Due to this special transmission design, two  driving motors can be placed on the fixed base, thereby enhancing the load-carrying  capacity of the robotic drive unit. Parallel robots constructed and actuated with  the proposed units should exhibit higher load-carrying capacity and faster motion  capability, as compared to existing drives. The conceptual design of the unit is  first proposed, and a design alternative is then discussed. The application of this  novel drive unit is illustrated by the example of integrating three such drive units  into a six-dof parallel manipulator with three Universal-Prismatic-Spherical (UPS)  legs. With six actuators installed on the fixed base, such a manipulator can be  endowed with high stiffness, high speed, high accuracy and high load-carrying  capacity. Furthermore, a testbed is designed in order to verify the kinematic and  dynamic performance of the drive unit. The kinematic analysis of the drive unit, the  testbed and the six-dof parallel manipulator is conducted. The CAD modelling and  animation results are included to validate the design and the kinematics of the  drive unit.</description><creator>Qin, Zhongkai, 1975-</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Design and analysis of a two-dof novel drive unit for parallel robots</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hm50ts226.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q237hs47c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:b8515n97f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis reports results on the investigation of the  thermodynamics and kinetics of adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA) on a  platinum electrode at pH 7.4 in a wide temperature range using the electrochemical  techniques of cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)  and differential capacitance (DC).

The charges  consisted of a packed bed of reactive particles saturated with a liquid explosive.  Once the charge was detonated, the particles accelerated to high velocities and  impacted a rigid plate or cantilever gauges. The positive phase pressure impulse at  the rigid plate surface and the cantilever bend angles were measured at various  distances. Comparison of the results for large diameter Zirconium (millimetre-sized)  and small diameter Aluminum particles (sub-micron) suggested that the impact and  fragmentation of the former contributed to the overall loading of the blast wave  within the near field. Single particle acceleration experiments concluded that the  impacting of burning particles with a rigid structure resulted in fragmentation at  all impact velocities. This suggested that the fragmentation mechanism was an  efficient means by which to increase the overall energy release rate from the  particle combustion process. Non-burning impact experiments were also conducted.  Results implied the importance of shear banding and thermal stressing within the  blunt impact and fragmentation mechanisms. Critical impact velocities for  fragmentation with Zirconium, Titanium and Aluminum particles were obtained above  which fragmentation of the metallic spheres occurred.</description><creator>Janidlo, Stephen</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>High velocity impact and fragmentation of reactive metallic particles</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v692t695d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0p096764n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):35250</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
