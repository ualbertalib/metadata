The study of the early forest industries has been most successfully treated by the economic historian. On the other hand, the pulp and paper industry, with the exception of the newsprint sector, has been relatively neglected by Canadian economists. We feel there is a need for an appraisal of this industry in terms of the welfare effects arising from its development. From this thesis the form of the present work emerges. What have been the main forces shaping the growth of the industry, i.e. why has it developed in the particular way it has? What are the present characteristics of the industry which have been determined by these developmental forces? How does this particular configuration affect the national economy? And finally, what are the welfare implications of the growth and present structure of this industry from the classical viewpoint of international specialization?</description><creator>Wiseman, Sylvia.</creator><contributor>Yajey, B.

This thesis deals with the parasites of two of them, Philander trinitatis (Thomas) and Didelphis marsupialis. The latter has two sub-species on the island, D.m. insularis (Allen) and D.m. karkinophaga (Zimmerman), the former being the predominant form. The latter is known throughout all of Central and South America as the crab-eating opossum. Both the species of Didelphis are known on the island by the inhabitants as the "Manicou". The Philander is known simply as "Philander". Two species of marsupials not included as hosts in this collection belong to the genus Marmosa, M. chapmani (Allen), and M. carri (Allen and Chapman). Insofar as could be determined from the literature available, only D.m. karkinophaga has been examined for helminths to any extent up to this time, as no parasite records for any of the other species were found. The majority of the work on the mainland has been done with a related sub-species D.m. aurita which occurs in Brazil. In the north the Virginia opossum (P.m. virginiana) has received much attention. It is easily captured and present in large numbers. Being a lone species, it is thoroughly investigated. The genus Philander contains related species on the mainland; among them are Philander philander, Philander laniger laniger and Philander laniger pallidus. The latter form is present in some numbers in Panama.[...]</description><creator>Wolfgang, Robert William.</creator><contributor>DuPorte, E.

W. Nuffield of the University of Toronto. On Dr. Nuffield1s suggestion the writer undertook the study of the Camray Discovery Dyke as a thesis problem. Camray Discovery Dyke is the diabase dyke on the property of Camray Mines, Limited, along which Robert Campbell discovered an earlier-reported deposit of pitchblende. The obvious areal relationship between the pitchblende and the diabase may be genetic and/or structural; and with this in mind the writer secured a fairly complete section of specimens across the dyke near the shaft, and from the granites on both sides. Several specimens of the actual contacts were obtained, as well as a suite of pitchblende ore specimens. Little attempt could be made to investigate the detailed structural relationships, as surface exposures are poor, and underground workings had hardly been started at the time of the examination. The writer gratefully acknowledges the assistance of Dr. A. W. Jolliffe, and Dr. E. H. Kranck of the Department of Geological Sciences, McGill University, in the preparation of this report. Dr. E. W. Nuffield of the University of Toronto helpfully identified several minerals by X-ray diffraction pattern methods, and one of the writer's fellow-students, Mr. F. C. Taylor, assisted in photomicrography. [...]</description><creator>Woolverton, Ralph Solon.</creator><contributor>Jolliffe, A.

However, in spite of considerable speculation, it took more than 300 years before any indication of their probable function was obtained. This speculation centered about the probable action of the black bile ("atra bile”) which was found in the central part of the gland. No recognition was taken of the post-mortem autolysis which occurred in the medulla so subject to it, in the often very much delayed human post-mortem examinations of that time. The cortex being more resistant to autolysis usually remained and it was Jean Rdolan( 2 ) in 1629 who thought that the adrenals were capsules filled with liquid and named them the supra-renal capsules ("Capsula suprarenalis"). Magendie in 1841 noticed the comparatively large size of the adrenals in the foetus and postulated that they might be foetal kidneys. The first experimental work on the adrenal having a relatively firm basis owes its initiation to Thomas Addison( 3 ) who in 1849 described before the South London Medical society the syndrome which bears his name, the clinical description of which appeared in his classical monograph(4) in 1855, "On the Constitutional and Local Effect of Disease of the Supra-renal Capsules".

A sector of the organization of medical services in the urban community will be explored here, as seen by interviewing some forty medical men of the French group. The social boundaries of the French medical system will be indicated first, and, the self-sufficiency of this system being shown by its isolation from other similar systems of other ethnic identification, this study will give particular attention to the interpersonal relationships involved in medical practice within the French professional group. Throughout this work, the ethnic character of the group studied will remain obvious. Few situations, however, will involve relationships across ethnic lines. Some characteristics of the institutions studied will be found peculiar to the group, but many more will show the uniformities to be anticipated in the social institutions providing medical care, as these have developed concurrently and similarly in many communities of Euro-American culture. Our communities depend on medical functionaries who are members of a traditional profession. Medical services are provided through a peculiar system of free enterprise, which articulates at various points with philanthropic institutions. The French-Canadian medical system has developed by assimilating these cultural definitions [...]</description><creator>Brazeau, Ernest Jacques, 1923-</creator><contributor>Hall, O.

The lesions of the heart have been likened by most investigators to the lesions occurring in the hearts of human cases of rheumatic fever(2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10,ll,12,21); the lesions of the arteries to the lesions occurring in human periarteritis nodosa(2-18,21) and those of the kidney to human glomerulonephritis(14,19-22). Whereas the opinion regarding the comparison of the lesions of the arteries and kidneys to the human diseases has been almost unanimous, the idea has been expressed that the lesions of the heart cannot be justifiably compared to the lesions of human rheumatic fever(13,23-25). Since our interest in the experimental lesions stems from interest in their relationship to the lesions of the human diseases, it is pertinent to begin with a consideration of the validity of the comparison of the experimentally-induced with the spontaneously occurring diseases.</description><creator>Kobernick, Sidney D.</creator><contributor>More, R.

Metadiorite, a feldspar-hornblende gneiss with coarse pyroxene-hornblende border facies, was formed by assimilation or metasomatic reconstitution of chiefly volcanic rocks prior to the batholithic stage. Syenite intrudes it in places, in others a gradational contact shows evidence of metasomatic action. The syenite may be Tertiary. Porphyry, aplite, lamprophyre and diabase dykes cut the granodiorite and some veins. These and monzonite chonoliths may be Tertiary.

In its normal host, Gallus gallus, the adult stages of the parasite are found in the lumen of the caeca. The larval stages may be found in the lumina and epithelium of the caecal glands as late as the seventh day following infection but usually no tissue invasion is present beyond the tenth day. The degree of typhlitis produced by the larval invasion is variable, depending on the degree of infection. The economic importance of the parasite came to light through the work of Graybill and Smith (19). They demonstrated that blackhead could be produced by feeding embryonated heterakid eggs to turkey poults. In the caeca this nematode acquires the protozoan Histomonas meleagridis, incriminated as the aetiological agent of infectious enterohepatitis. How the protozoa invade the caecal worm or the form taken by the protozoa in the nemic egg has not yet been explained, but in view of the volume of circumstantial evidence, the belief that these phenomena do occur is accepted by the majority of parasitologists. Not all members of this species of roundworm are capable of acting as vectors of the protozoan disease. Tyzzer (36) was able to produce a blackhead-free strain of H.gallinae. This strain was attained by passage in chicks for several generations. Connell (12) located a source of blackhead-free heterakids in Saskatchewan.[...]</description><creator>Oliver, William Thomas.</creator><contributor>Cameron, T.

Its achievements are more or less valuable for any of the other branches of biology. But the first goal of neuroanatomy is to form a morphological basis for the neurobiological sciences. Neurobiology comprises the total of all problems related to the functioning of the nervous system. An incentive to study these problems springs from two sources. First, as has been expected, the understanding of the functioning of the nervous system may help to prevent and cure its diseases. Second, the nervous system has attracted the attention of all those who have been interested in the fundamental problem of the relation of mind and body. For there is little doubt that the understanding of this most intriguing problem of life cannot be successfully approached until a thorough knowledge of the mechanism of the nervous system is acquired. It is only natural that interest has been largely concentrated on the human nervous system, and in particular on the human brain. But many problems may be approached more easily by experimental methods, which cannot be applied to human beings; and so, study of the nervous system of animals has been carried on simultaneously.

Importance of the study. Nothing has been known about the climate of the ablation period on any Canadian glacier or ice-cap. Wood noted that previous to 1948 it was difficult to recall a single example of studies carried out in North America and devoted to the great areas of snow accumulation. In the systematic investigation of glaciers it isimperative that glaciologic and meteorologic research go hand in hand, since the problems of the two fields are intimately joined — precipitation with alimentation of the glaciers, interior temperature of ice and firn with air temperatures. As pointed out by Ahlmann, glaciology requires meteorological observations of a special kind. General and local climatological information is necessary to determine the ablation, with observations from the glacier surface itself.[...]</description><creator>Orvig, Svenn.</creator><contributor>Hare, F.

While the extensive literature on the subject contains references to the times required for such reactions to proceed to their maximum extents, which are generally short of completion, it appears that no kinetic study of any of the reactions has ever been made. As a consequence, optimal conditions for the preparation of these free radicals have never been established, nor has any serious consideration been given to the mechanism of the reactions involved in their formation. The original purpose of the present study was to obtain information which would permit preparation of triphenylmethyl free radicals in maximum concentration with minimum expenditure of time, preliminary to a projected investigation of certain reactions of the radicals themselves. It soon became apparent, however, that the triphenylmethyl chloride-silver system under investigation provided a new approach to the study of tarnishing reactions ("Anlaufvorgang" of Wagner (1)), i.e. the type of corrosion reaction in which a metal is attacked by an electronegative substance with formation of a compact layer of reaction product between the reacting species. The work was therefore continued not only with the original objective in view, but also with the intent to examine the results from the point of view of current theories[...]</description><creator>Perry, Ernest John.</creator><contributor>Winkler, C.

The work reported herein was aimed at determining the presence of dormancy in freshly harvested seed; the effect of dry storage; the effect of stratification at low temperatures both in the laboratory and under simulated field conditions; the germinating capacity of unstratified seed in the soil; and the share of the seed coats in delaying germination. Germinating capacity of freshly harvested seed varied, depending on species, from zero to almost 100%. Dry storage was beneficial in increasing the germination percentages. Stratification at low temperature was effective with some species and, ineffective with others. Germination of small-seeded species declined with deeper sowing. Seed coats proved more or less important in delaying germination. Embryo dormancy was found to vary with the different species ranging from complete absence to more than one year.

This phenomenon was systematically investigated by Andrews with carbon dioxide in 1869 (3) and his results, extended theoretically by van der Waals shortly afterwards, form the basis of the well known Andrews-van der Waals theory of the continuity of the liquid and gaseous state and of the concept of a -uniquely defined critical point (87). The far reaching implications of a continuous transition from the gaseous state, whose properties are easily interpretable in molecular terms, to the liquid state which was previously considered a separate and distinct state of matter with its own set of characteristic properties, led investigators thenceforth to test different aspects of the consequences of the theory. In short, the experimental question presented by the theory is: Do the properties of the liquid and of the gaseous phase, in fact, approach each other continuously at equal critical concentration and do they become identical at the critical point, or do the two phases retain characteristic properties even when visually indistinguishable?

By the use of this radio-element, evidence has accumulated to show that the circulating thyroid hormone is thyroxine, loosely bound to plasma proteins. It was considered of importance to investigate the fate of this hormone in the body. This was done by means of thyroxine labeled with radio-iodine. In the past, this problem has been investigated in normal animals. The present investigation was intended to find out whether or not the fate of thyroxine in the body was influenced by physiological factors such as thyroid extirpation or diet and by pathological conditions such as the presence of mammary tumor. The mo se, a species in which the fate of radiothyroxine had not been previously investigated, was chosen for this work because of two considerations. Radiothyroxine with high specific activity was available only in limited amounts. The size of the mouse - the smallest mammal available - it was thought, would make it possible to increase the concentration of radioactivity to the maximum attainable in any given organ or tissue. Furthermore, strains of tumor-bearing mice were readily obtainable and, therefore, the influence of tumors could be examined in this species.[...]</description><creator>Schwartz, Solomon.</creator><contributor>Leblond, C.

One biography of David Urquhart was published by Miss Gertrude Robinson in 1920. This is a useful book since it presents a good deal of material from the Urquhart Papers. Yet Miss Robinson is obviously a friend of the family, and has refrained from making an effort at serious criticism. The same may be said of A Memoir of Mrs. Urquhart, written by Mrs. Bishop in 1897. This second book contains a good deal of information about Urquhart, but Mrs. Bishop is principally concerned with the life of Mrs. Urquhart, née Harriet Fortescue, whom Urquhart married in 1853. Both books give more attention to the religious influences on Urquhart’s life than they do to his efforts to play a role in politics. Although Urquhart remained a Calvinist, he had strong leanings towards Roman Catholicism during the last ten years of his life, and his wife became aCatholic convert after his death. Professor G.H. Balsover has written an article on Urquhart during the years 1835 - 37,based on the use of Foreign Office records and the Urquhart papers at Balliol. This account, however, is written from Urquhart’s point of view, and does not disclose the attitude of the Cabinet towards Urquhart.[...]</description><creator>Senior, Hereward.</creator><contributor>Reid, W.

Notwithstanding this outstanding feature of Homo Sapiens, it still remains true that in certain situations, and under certain conditions, Man's behavioural and thought processes are marked by stereotypy. This characteristic of behaviour has been labelled perseveration, habituation, and rigidification.

(purslane) was first discovered and described as it occurred on purslane by Rader (59) in 1948. He proved that the disease was due to an unknown pathogenic fungus which he described briefly and named Helminthosporium portulacae nov. sp. In 1940, a diseased rose moss specimen from a private garden in Gananoque, Ontario, was sent to the Central Laboratory of the Division of Botany and Plant Pathology, at Ottawa, Ontario, for diagnosis. Various fungi were found fruiting on the specimen, but an unfamiliar one seemed to predominate. This organism was not isolated, but it is now believed that it probably was H. portulacae. In 1949, when the writer first became attached to the Division, another diseased rose moss specimen, apparently from the same garden at Gananoque, was again sent to Ottawa, The same unfamiliar organism was found fruiting on the seed capsules of the diseased plant, and numerous isolations yielded a fungus which resembled H. portulacae as described by Rader (39). Artificial inoculation tests on purslane proved it to be pathogenic to that species. That same year, Reeder (40) isolated H. portulacae from diseased purslane plants growing in field plots and in the greenhouse at the University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and the writer isolated the fungus from both hosts in field plots and in a public park at Ste. Anne de Bellevue, Quebec. [...]</description><creator>Sibalis, Jack.</creator><contributor>Coulson, J.

In the geology of the area, three different problems are presented. These are: (1) the structural and time relationships of the norite - micropegmatite, the granites of the southern nickel range, the rock of the offsets; (2) the character of the noritend cropegmatite itself; (3) the genesis of the nickeliferous pyrrhotite ore bodies. In this paper the relationship of the norite and the quartz diorite of the Copper Cliff offset will be discussed. It is important to work out both the correct relationships and the age of the quartz diorite because, as all recent workers now agree, the sulfide ore bodies are genetically related to this rock. The quartz diorite is “offset rock”, so called by Coleman, (1903), because many of the dykes seemed to be extensions or offsets from the main norite mass. Evidence favouring the offset rocks as part of the norite has been set forth also by Burrows and Rickaby, (1934), and Collins (1934, P. 169). On the other hand, evidence for regarding the offset rocks as a separate and much later intrusion has been assembled by Yates (1938 ). Recent studies in the Sudbury area by Cooke, (1946, P. 69), led him to support Yates’ conclusions.[...]</description><creator>Slaght, William Henry.</creator><contributor>Stevenson, J.

Germination tests and root studies were conducted on L. corniculatus. L. corniculatus and L. uliginosus were compared morphologically and for resistance to flooding and 2, 4-D. The nurse crop retarded birdsfoot establishment but pure stand and birdsfoot-timothy plots yielded substantially during the first season. Hard seeds in birdsfoot samples suggest the use of scarified seed. Extensive root development of young trefoil seedlings is associated with restricted topgrowth. L. corniculatus prostrate types demonstrated superior winter survival and greater desirability than upright strains for this locality. Light applications of 2, 4-D may control weeds during birdsfoot establishment. L. uliginosus differs from L. corniculatus chiefly by rooting rhizomes, hairy foliage and smaller seed, flooding experiments indicated adaptability of Bunker and big birdsfoot to moist conditions.</description><creator>Slater, Douglas Tory.</creator><contributor>Steppler, H.

Two hundred and twenty-six specimens from nickel-bearing intrusives have been analyzed for MgO, Cu, Ni and S. The intrusives are located in widely scattered parts of the earth, but the majority examined are found in North America. It is shown that the value of the S/Ni ratio of the sulphide deposit is inversely proportional to the MgO content of the intrusive rock. There is an abrupt change in the value of the S/Ni ratio between rocks possibly formed by early accumulative processes, and the rocks which follow Bowen's liquid line of descent. That is, the ultrabasic rocks, which are generally rich in nickel, show less fluctuation in S/Ni ratio than the feldspathic rocks, which show rapid increase in S/Ni ratios with relatively moderate decrease in MgO content. A similar break occurs in the relationship between total nickel in the silicate minerals of igneous rocks and the MgO content of these rocks. A graph of Mg0-Si02 for igneous rocks also has a pattern of points similar to the MgO-S/Ni relationship. Consequently, it is postulated that the S/Ni ratio for pentlandite deposits exists as a real characteristic of intrusive rocks. The total quantity of sulphide molecules that may be dissolved per unit volume of basic magma is believed to be, more or less, constant.[...]</description><creator>Smith, Alan Robinson.</creator><contributor>Stevenson, J.

As a result, the tracer technique has become an important tool in all branches of scientific research. This technique had early application in biochemical research and its usefulness is borne out by the large number of publications using radioactive tracers, which appear every month in scientific journals. Because of the very important role that is played by carbon in our physical and biological world, the outstanding importance of a radioactive isotope of carbon is readily seen. It affords a tool by which, for example, one may trace through all its metabolic ramifications, the utilization of organic materials by biological systems. The most useful of the five known isotopes of carbon is C-14. Because of its long half-life, about 5300 years, one does not have to consider decay corrections while using it. Furthermore, C14 emits only a soft beta particle whose maximum energy is 0.15 Mev. This weak radiation minimizes health hazards when C14 is used but it gives rise to the only objectionable property of the isotope. Experimentally, a beta particle with maximum energy of 0.15 Mev. requires specialized techniques for accurate determination of its activity. Our objective was the preparation of steroid hormones containing C14 in the ring and side chain.[...]</description><creator>Solomon, Samuel.</creator><contributor>Heard, R.

The city of Truro, a main rail centre for the Maritimes, lies twelve miles to the north. Halifax, with its excellent shipping facilities, is situated 54 miles south of Brookfield. The main line of the Canadian National Railway passes through Brookfield, and links Halifax with Truro. A good dirt road permits easy access to the area from the village of Brookfield. One mile east of the village, this road branches off from the Middle Stewiacke—Brookfield highway, which is at present in the process of being paved. History of Deposit The first mention made of the deposit is found in How's Mineralogy of Nova Scotia, published in 1869. Fletcher, in his report for the Provincial Government published in 1891, also makes a brief note of the deposit. However, it was not until 1944 that serious consideration was given to economic possibilities of the ore body. During that year, Canadian Industrial Minerals Limited, of Walton, N.S., had the property under option, and they put down three diamond drill holes with a total depth of 426 feet. This company evidently did not think it feasible to develop the deposit, for the drilling program was abandonned. [...]</description><creator>Stevenson, I. M.</creator><contributor>Clark, T.

Scriver and Horst Oertel of McGill University reported three occurrences of a condition which they termed, "Necrotic Sequestration of the Kidneys in Pregnancy (Symmetrical Cortical Necrosis)"(l). In the same report they included a review of the literature dealing with the condition. Scriver described it as a comparatively clear-cut clinical entity, the outstanding features being anuria or oliguria and marked azotemia, the picture resembling that seen in bilateral obstruction of the ureters. The literature reviewed included isolated instances occurring during the course of infectious diseases (diphtheria, pulmonary tuberculosis, dysentery, pneumonia and peritonitis), but by far the majority of cases occurred in females following an accident of pregnancy, usually a retroplacental hemorrhage occurring from the fourth month to full term. Oertel emphasised cortical necrosis identified with bland or anemic infarction as the essential part of the pathological process. He agreed with most previous investigators in believing the necrosis to be caused by thrombosis of the interlobular vessels. He did not believe that the thrombosis followed vascular spasm and suggested that it was due to a stagnation of the blood in response to tissue irritation, a process described by Ricker and his school(2). He suggested that a "paralytic terminal segmentary circulatory downfall" was in some way related to a "general abnormal state of vasomotor irritability of the pregnant [...]</description><creator>Stinson, David A.</creator><contributor>Evelyn, K.
