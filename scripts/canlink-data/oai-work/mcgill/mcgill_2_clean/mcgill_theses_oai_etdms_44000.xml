Posttranscriptional regulation of TNF expression depends on interaction of  RNA-binding proteins with an AU-rich element (ARE) within the 3' untranslated region  of TNF mRNA that modulates translational efficacy and mRNA stability. We screened a  macrophage protein expression library with a TNF-ARE cRNA probe and identified the  RNA-binding protein FXR1P, closely related to fragile X mental retardation syndrome  protein FMRP. Macrophage cell lines were generated from FXR1 knockout mice and their  littermate controls. The FXR1 knockout macrophages had enhanced TNF protein  production following activation compared to control macrophages. Expression of  several other proteins encoded by ARE-containing transcripts was also affected by  FXR1P deficiency. A GFP-ARE reporter that has green fluorescent protein (GFP)  expression under control of the 3'-UTR of TNF mRNA had enhanced expression in  transfected macrophages deficient in FXR1P. The ablation of FXR1P led to a  dramatically enhanced association of the TNF mRNA with polyribosomes, demonstrating  the important role of FXR1P in the posttranscriptional regulation of TNF expression.  Our data suggests that release of this repression by FXR1P occurs during LPS-induced  macrophage activation. Complementation of the knockout macrophages with recombinant  FXR1P resulted in decreased TNF protein production, supporting our findings that  FXR1P operates as a repressor of TNF translation. Using 2D electrophoresis gel  coupled with mass spectrometry to explore the functional role of FXR1P in  macrophages, we showed that FXR1P deficiency had an impact on several proteins,  including G3BP1 and CBF-A that have been linked to posttranscriptional regulation.  Finally, phosphorylation analysis of FXR1P indi</description><creator>Garnon, James</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Fragile X-related protein FXR1P regulates proinflammatory cytokine TNF expression at the posttranscriptional level</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jq085k53h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xw42n844d</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:w0892b32n</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:26:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica is the etiological  agent of human amebiasis. Trophozoites colonize the colonic mucus layer and may  invade the epithelium subsequent to overcoming the mucus barrier. MUC2 is the major  gel-forming mucin secreted by goblet cells in the colon and serves to maintain  epithelial barrier function as well as acting as a major host defense against  invading pathogens. The polymerization of MUC2 monomers via the N- and C- terminal  cysteine rich D-domains is essential for mucus gel formation and confers protection  to the underlying mucosa. Amoebae secrete cysteine proteinases, glycosidases and an  unidentified mucus secretagogue, which may play a role in overcoming the protective  mucus barrier. We hypothesize that E. histolytica cysteine proteinases as well as  glycosidases are involved in mucus degradation and weakening of the mucus barrier by  disrupting mucin polymerization. Amoebae secreted cysteine proteinases were shown to  degrade the cysteine rich regions of MUC2 involved in polymerization and abrogate  its protective function. More importantly, the major E. histolytica surface  proteinase, cysteine proteinase 5 (EhCP5) was shown to specifically degrade  [35S]cysteine labeled colonic mucin as effectively as secreted components. Moreover,  trophozoites genetically engineered to express low levels of CP activity were  incapable of traversing a mucus barrier and destroying the underlying epithelium,  indicating a strong dependence between amebic invasiveness and cysteine protease  activity. In addition, we have demonstrated that EhCPs specifically target the MUC2  C-terminus resulting in destabilization of the mucin polymeric network. Parasite  glycosidase activity was also shown to contribute to mucin oligosaccharide  degradation. Taken together, these results indicate that E. histolytica can  substantially weaken the colonic mucus barrier via proteolytic degradation and  glycosidase activity to compromise the gel and</description><creator>Moncada, Darcy Marie</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Biology, Parasitology.</subject><title>Entamoeba histolytica cysteine proteinases facilitate parasite invasion of the colon by disrupting the colonic mucus barrier</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bv73c096x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w0892b32n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Parasitology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:707958185</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:26:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The main purpose of the present study was to investigate whether  a shift from absolute to relative pitch perception occurs during early childhood.  Other factors that can influence the development of absolute pitch, such as  cognitive abilities and the child's environment were examined. Young children  completed (n=88): (1) a variety of pitch tasks (absolute and relative pitch tests)  prior to and after two months of focused instruction on absolute and relative pitch,  (2) tests of cognitive abilities, and (3) a questionnaire gathering information  about family musical environment. The results indicate that a shift from absolute to relative  perception occurs between the ages of 5 and 7. Children younger than six  demonstrated limited ability to perform relational tasks such as ordering bells,  identifying transposed intervals, and comparing pitches. However, they memorized  target pitches better than the older children, matched target tones on the xylophone  and sang newly learned songs in their original key more often than did the older  children. Older children benefited to a larger extent from the training on relative  pitch. Cognitive and spatial abilities were related to absolute pitch development:  children who identified pitches better had a more sequential and a less simultaneous  way of processing information. Family musical environment seems to have influenced  the development of absolute pitch. Implications for the acquisition of absolute  pitch are discussed.</description><creator>Moreno Sala, Mar√≠a Teresa</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Musical ability -- Testing.</subject><subject>Musical perception in children.</subject><subject>Cognition in children.</subject><subject>Musical pitch.</subject><title>The influence of perceptual shift, cognitive abilities and environmental factors on young children's development of absolute and relative pitch perception /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fn106z62p.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/707958185</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gt54kn60h</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:26:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Solar Tower Atmospheric Cherenkov Effect Experiment (STACEE)  is an atmospheric Cherenkov telescope that detects cosmic gamma-rays using the  wavefront-sampling technique. STACEE uses the large mirror area of the National  Solar Thermal Test Facility (NSTTF) to achieve an energy threshold below 200 GeV.  This telescope was used to search for high-energy gamma-ray emission from the Crab  Nebula and pulsar. A statistical excess of 4.07sigma in the number of on-source  events compared to off-source events was detected in 15 hours of on-source observing  time, corresponding to an integral flux above the energy threshold (Ethr = 185 +/-  35 GeV) of I(E &gt; Ethr) = (2.5 +/- 0.6) x 10-10 photons cm -2 s-1. The observed  flux is in agreement with the previous result obtained by STACEE-32 and consistent  with the power law spectrum seen at higher energies. A special instrument was  developed to make simultaneous observations of the Crab in the optical and gamma-ray  bands. Pulsed emission was detected in the optical band, demonstrating the accuracy  of the barycentering and epoch folding analysis tools. After barycentering the  arrival times and calculating the rotational phases of gamma-ray events, no evidence  for pulsed emission from the Crab pulsar was found. The upper limit on the pulsed  fraction of the signal was 16.4% at the 99.9% confidence level. Unfortunately,  neither the polar cap model, nor the outer gap model is excluded by this new upper  limit.</description><creator>Fortin, Pascal</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Physics, Astronomy and Astrophysics.</subject><title>Observations of the Crab Nebula and pulsar in the optical and [gamma]-ray bands with STACEE</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nv9353430.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gt54kn60h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6t053g548</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:26:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Biofilm communities were cultivated in rotating annular  bioreactors using water from the South Saskatchewan River. The impacts of seasonal  variations, nutrients, pollutants and dissolved oxygen on the activity and  composition of the biofilms were assessed by using a combination of microcosm assays  and molecular biology techniques. The seasonal pattern in nitrification, denitrification and  hexadecane mineralization, and in the occurrence of nirK in the South Saskatchewan  River biofilms was: fall greater than winter, which was equivalent to spring.  Hexadecane mineralization was higher in fall 1999 than in fall 2001, denitrification  was similar in these two years, and no seasonal pattern of nitrification was  observed. The addition of combined nutrients (C, N, and P) resulted in  significant increases in the measured bacterial activities and in the predominance  of alkB, nirS and nirK in all seasons and years. The addition of individual  nutrients did not stimulate hexadecane mineralization, denitrification, and the PCR  amplification of nirS and nirK. In fall 1999, CNP and, to a lesser extent P,  stimulated nitrification, whereas in fall 2001, no pattern was observed. The results  showed that nutrients, especially P, were limiting for bacterial activities, and  that the biofilm activities and composition varied with nutrient availability and  time of year. At the concentration assessed (1 ppb), hexadecane partially  inhibited denitrification to similar extents in both years, had a negative impact on  nitrification and hexadecane mineralization in fall 1999, and a positive impact on  these two latter activities in fall 2001. Nickel (0.5 mg liter-1 ) negatively  affected denitrification but had no effect on hexadecane mineralization. The alkB  and nirS genes were less predominant and absent, respectively, in biofilms grown in  the presence of nickel. DGGE analyses indicated that nickel reduced the biofilm  bacterial diversity. The results presented herein provide much needed information on  the microbial ecology of river biofilms, and on the impact and interactive effects  of pollutant and nutrient inputs on these biofilms. These results and the techniques  used in this project can be applied to monitor environmental effects of  anthropogenic activities on aquatic biofilms, and can contribute to establish or  revise environmental regulations.</description><creator>Ch√©nier, Martin</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Biofilms.</subject><subject>Microbial metabolism.</subject><subject>Alkanes -- Metabolism.</subject><subject>Nitrogen cycle.</subject><title>Impact of seasonal variations, nutrients, pollutants and dissolved oxygen on the microbial composition and activity of river biofilms</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ms35t908d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6t053g548</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gx41mj45n</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:26:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The increasing importance of pornography since its  commercialization at the end of the seventies modified the artistic landscape of  sexual representation. What has occurred is a transformation of the horizon of  expectations of pornographic images, the definition of eroticism and the  relationship between the two notions. In this perspective, the thesis concentrates  on the analysis of the appropriation of certain distinct traits of hard core  pornography in feminist art. Specifically, it is a qualitative analysis of the  interrelations between eroticism and pornography in feminist art during the 1980s.  The thesis proceeds to an in-depth analysis of several works by Pipilotti Rist,  Annie Sprinkle, and Marlene Dumas as well as adding three earlier works of sexually  explicit representation by Carolee Schneemann. The analysis of these works aims to  redefine notions of pornography and eroticism, drawing on the work of Linda Williams  for the first definition and Georges Bataille for the second. The theoretical  context of the thesis, which also turns out to be the historical context of the  works, is made up of disciplinary approaches that have most contributed to the  debate around eroticism and pornography: art history, philosophy, feminist studies,  queer theory, semiology and psychoanalysis. The thesis makes several conclusions. First, the dynamic between  eroticism and pornography does not have to be considered oppositional; the two  methods of expression are frequently both represented in the same work. Also, women  are no longer uniquely victims of pornography (they are increasingly in the role of  pornographic auteure) and the analysis of these works confirms that feminists have  appropriated the genre to explore a diversity of female eroticisms and propose a  form of feminist, intersubjective pornography. Finally, the use by female artists of  syntaxes and features typical of pornography helps to bring about a demand for a  more complete and complex female subjectivity which is no longer only political, but  also sexual.</description><creator>Lavigne, Julie</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Feminism and art</subject><subject>Women and erotica</subject><subject>Pornography</subject><subject>Erotic art</subject><title>L'art f√©ministe et la travers√©e de la pornographie : √©rotisme et intersubjectivit√© chez Carolee Schneemann, Pipilotti Rist, Annie Sprinkle et Marlene Dumas</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tt44pn37g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gx41mj45n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xs55mc488</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:26:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this inquiry, I used a qualitative-portraiture approach to  examine the social, cultural, and psychological influences on piano students'  decisions to continue taking piano lessons. I collected data between 1997 and 2002.  Data types included field notes, interpretive memos, audiotaped and videotaped piano  lessons, audiotaped one-on-one interviews and retrospective interviews, email  messages, and written documents. The main sources of data used for analysis were  transcribed videotapes of piano lessons in the music studio and interviews with the  teacher and three of her promising students. I drew on Vygotsky Halliday, and  Wenger's theoretical frameworks to conceptualize my understanding of the social,  cultural, and psychological issues that influence promising music students'  commitment to learning music. I used Vygotsky's social-psychological-developmental  theory of learning and Halliday's social theory of language to portray the  significance of piano students' experiences in a music studio, their relationships  with their teacher, and the teachers' use of language in the decision. Vygotsky's  perspective on volitional-affective tendencies provided a framework for  understanding how students' abilities to cope with their emotions influenced them to  continue their music studies. I drew on Halliday's concept of Register to analyze  the transcribed videotaped lesson data sets. I used Wenger's notion of Community of  Practice to portray the social, cultural, and historical characteristics that play a  role in motivating students to learn music. I found that being socialized into the  music community, developing musical competencies, becoming a self-regulated learner,  and being able to cope with the emotional experiences of playing and performing  shape students' decisions to continue piano lessons.

Excitability control  of these neurons derives largely from a network of inhibitory interneurons that  render dynamic inhibition via the GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) and glycine  neurotransmitter systems. However, the processes that contribute to the regulation  of these systems under normal and pathophysiological conditions have not been well  elucidated. To shed light on these issues, our studies employed a variety of  techniques to examine mechanisms of plasticity of intrinsic inhibition in the SDH.  We began this survey by examining the organization of GABA- and glycine-mediated  inhibition in SDH neurons from developmentally immature rats; this study was  undertaken to understand the early arrangements of local inhibition in the pain  pathway, a critical study for a system that is phylogenetically primitive. We found  that in slices taken from neonates, corelease of GABA and glycine from terminals  coactivated postsynaptic GABA A and glycine receptors (GABAARs and GlyRs) on lamina  I and II neurons. In contrast, at all ages older than three weeks, quantal release  of GABA and glycine never coactivated GABAA and glycine receptors at synapses.  Because neurobiological processes will often revert to a developmental state when  subjected to insult, we next assessed whether lamina I neuronal inhibitory synapses  would assume an immature-like configuration after nerve injury. We found that  GABAARs and GlyRs did indeed comediate quantal postsynaptic events in adult lamina I  neurons after peripheral nerve injury (PNI); moreover, we revealed a shift in  neuronal anion gradient that translated to GABAAR/GlyR-mediated postsynaptic  currents that were depolarizing. This shift was caused by the downregulation of the  anion cotransporter KCC2, and was shown to direc</description><creator>Coull, Jeffrey A.

The research employed a mark-recapture  study, underwater visual censuses (UVCs) and catch data from an unrelated  experimental sampling program in the Ria Formosa Lagoon (southern Portugal). These  small-bodied fish are characterized by rapid growth rate, early age at maturity,  high natural mortality, short generation time, short life span and multiple  spawnings per year, traits that are usually associated with resilience to  exploitation. However specialized parental care, complex social interactions, small  adult home ranges and benthic habit confer risk to H. guttulatus. Population-level  responses to experimental reductions in non-selective fishing effort differed in  magnitude and direction between H. guttulatus and its smaller congener, Hippocampus  hippocampus: the abundance of H. guttulatus increased significantly while its  congener decreased in abundance. Hippocampus guttulatus preferred more complex,  vegetated habitats, while H. hippocampus preferred more open, sparsely vegetated  habitats. Thus it seems probable that H. guttulatus fared better in the more complex  habitats that developed when seining stopped, whereas H. hippocampus fared better in  the less complex habitat arising from repeated seining. I used an age-structured  stochastic simulation to evaluate the biological implications of a recommended  generic strategy (10 cm minimum size limit) for managing the exploitation and  international trade of seahorses, using H. guttulatus as a model.

It is a little studied outcome of Mexico's combination of  economic crisis (which served to increase the supply of female labour) and  subsequent adoption of neoliberal economic policies (which stimulated the demand for  female labour). In fact, what is not known, are the implications of this employment  for the Mexican women themselves. The dissertation moves beyond the existing  literature on the gendered consequences of employment and economic development, by  bringing in the citizenship literature to help define women's status. Specifically,  the dissertation proposes a way of determining these consequences by examining three  dimensions of women's status, two of which refer to women's roles and capabilities  in the public sphere---political and economic---and one which refers to women's  status in the private sphere---the household. By disaggregating the status variable,  the dissertation highlights the significant improvements in women's status while  identifying the remaining obstacles to gender equality. The dissertation develops a  number of measures of women's multidimensional status, and assesses the differences  between employed and non-employed women using data obtained from a survey of women  in Mexico City. In the economic sphere, the findings indicate that employment  improves women's status by enhancing women's independence. Employment provides women  with the economic resources that enable them to lessen their dependence on men. At  the same time, women continue to face inequality in the labour market, signifying  the continuing subordination of women. In terms of women's household status, the  findings show that women retain the primary responsibility for childcare, and for  the maintenance of the home.

However, as much as such work  has contributed to our understanding of Inuit and narwhal interaction, less is known  about contemporary Inuit hunting behaviour of narwhal. The research presented in  this dissertation redresses this gap by providing a detailed behavioural description  and analysis of the Inuit narwhal hunting in two critical environments utilized by  the Inuit of Pond Inlet---those of the spring floe-edge and the summer open  water. This information and its analysis are presented through three  manuscripts. The first manuscript forms the analytical basis of the behavioural  description by presenting through the use of a decision flow chart, the parameters  that affect narwhal hunting. The second and third manuscript explore different  foraging strategies involved in several major decisions the Inuit typically face  when pursuing narwhal at the floe-edge (Manuscript Two) and in the open water  environment (Manuscript Three). The data pertinent to the major decision factors  influencing actions in both environments were obtained through participant  observation, supplemented by interviews with hunters and elders. The main results of this research pertain to the different, but  complementary, strategies employed by Mittimatalingmiut (Pond Inlet Inuit) hunters  during the floe-edge and ice free seasons, as well as during the transition between  the two. Before break-up, the most frequent method employed in floe-edge and outpost  camp hunts is an ambush or a sit-and-wait strategy. Interestingly, during the  transition between floe-edge and complete open water, Pond Inlet Inuit utilized both  sit-and-wait and pursuit hunting strategies to maximize their hunting  opportunities.</description><creator>Lee, David S.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Narwhal -- Nunavut -- Pond Inlet (Inlet)</subject><subject>Whaling -- Social aspects -- Nunavut -- Pond Inlet (Inlet)</subject><subject>Inuit -- Nunavut -- Pond Inlet Region</subject><subject>Subsistence fishing -- Nunavut -- Pond Inlet (Inlet)</subject><title>The ecological and social dynamics of Inuit narwhal foraging at Pond Inlet, Nunavut /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c534fp416.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q237hs40f</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1831ck48m</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:26:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In 1890, lawyers Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis conceived of a  "sacred" right, the right to "be let alone." They argued for  this right as a measure of "retreat from the world" for protection of an  individual's "inviolate personality." Their argument was born in response  to intrusions made possible with technological developments in printing and  photography. For over a 100-year period, the concept of privacy has received  attention from a multi-disciplinary collection of scholars. Despite this significant  attention, however, relatively little consideration has been paid to  conceptualizations of privacy in the everyday. My dissertation utilizes the focus  group method to access individuals' stories about privacy in everyday lives. The  unit of the story is important because it contains rich connotative language, imbued  with meaning. My method of analysis is inspired primarily by Michel de Certeau and  Clifford Geertz. This analysis reveals four significant themes, all linking back to  Warren and Brandeis's original conceptualization in thinking about privacy in the  everyday: it is associated with fears, it is considered a defence against  surveillance, it is conceived of in metaphorical terms as a protective boundary, and  it protects personal information and individual autonomy. This dissertation explores  how individuals articulate these themes. It finds that individuals apply the  language of space as a framework in which to believe their privacy is protected from  surveillance.</description><creator>Dayan, Michael Oved</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Privacy</subject><subject>Privacy, Right of</subject><title>Privacy boundaries : stories of protecting personal autonomy in the information age</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9880vr40h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1831ck48m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g158bh69x</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:26:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We present new algorithms for computing local minimizers of the  trust-region subproblem (TRS). This problem consists in minimizing a quadratic  function subject to a ball constraint. In particular, this problem appears as a  subproblem in trust-region methods for constrained and unconstrained optimization.  First, by modeling the TRS with a new semidefinite program, different than the  standard semidefinite relaxation, we derive an algorithm, similar in structure to  the Rendl-Wolkowicz Algorithm, which implicitly solves the semidefinite program by  maximizing a single variable concave function over a closed interval. Second, we  extend the theory needed for this algorithm and the Rendl-Wolkowicz Algorithm to  derive two algorithms for computing a local-nonglobal minimizer of the TRS. These  algorithms are based upon finding a root of a single variable convex function with  the secant method. In all our algorithms, we compute at most the two smallest  eigenvalues of a parameterized matrix. This can be done using an ARPACK subroutine  which only requires matrix-vector multiplications. Hence, we are able to exploit the  possible sparsity of the Hessian matrix of the quadratic objective, making the  algorithms suitable for large problems. Computationally, the algorithms for finding  a local-nonglobal minimizer are more competitive than the previous approach based on  computing a matrix factorization at each iteration.</description><creator>Fortin, Charles</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Mathematics.</subject><title>Computing the local minimizers of a large and sparse trust-region subproblem</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8w32r610x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g158bh69x</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p5547r855</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:26:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The study was designed to develop a nutraceutical product from  by-products of fish processing. Fish oil was extracted from mackerel tissues (skin,  viscera and muscle) using hexane-isopropanol (3:2 v/v) and chloroform-methanol (2:1  v/v) solvent systems. An oxidative study was carried out to determine the best  processing and storage conditions to minimize autooxidation of mackerel oil. Urea  complexation was used to concentrate polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) from the  extracted fish oil. The urea complexation process was optimized to determine the  best reaction conditions for high yield of the omega-3 fatty acids in particular,  and total PUFA. Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) was synthesized from four  vegetable oils (sunflower, canola, soybean and corn) by alkaline isomerization. The  CLA isomers and PUFA concentrated from mackerel tissues were used to synthesize  triglycerides by lipase-catalyzed esterification. The effect of temperature,  reaction medium, enzyme, moisture removal system and glycerol to fatty acid ratio on  extent of synthesis were investigated. The synthesis process was also optimized  using central composite design to determine the best conditions for high synthesis  yield. The fatty acid composition and positional analyses were determined by GC-FID  and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (EI-MS) The results showed that mackerel skins were most suitable for  concentrating PUFA. The eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and -docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)  content of fish oil from the tissues examined ranged between 6.3--9.7 (wt%) with an  iodine value of 134 +/- 5.0. The baseline total PUFA content was increased from ca  21.0 to ca 83.0 (wt%) with an associated iodine value of 296 +/- 7.0 using urea  complexation. Low (50 ppm and 100 ppm) levels of alpha-tocopherol in combination  with low storage temperature (-40¬∞C) showed lowest oxidation after 66 days  of storage. High levels (250 and 500 ppm) of alpha-tocopherol were observed to be  prooxidant based on TBARS, peroxide and conjugated diene measurements. Urea to fatty  acid ratio and temperature were predominant effectors influencing the amounts of  individual omega-3 fatty acids and total PUFA concentrated by urea complexation. The  model developed for the optimized urea complexation process were capable of  predicting the yields of EPA, DHA, total PUFA and Iodine values to a high degree of  accuracy at R2 = 0.87, 0.96, 0.95, and 0.92 respectively. Sunflower oil was most suitable for synthesizing conjugated  linoleic acid by alkaline isomerization, compared with soybean, canola and corn oil.  Two CLA isomers, c9,t11 and t10, c12 were most abundant and occurred in  approximately equal proportions irrespective of vegetable oil used. Total CLA  synthesized from sunflower oil was 93.5 +/- 3.5 (wt%) with the two major isomers  making up 89 +/- 3.5 (wt%). Candida antartica lipase showed more synthesis activity  than Mucor meihie in both organic and solvent-free systems. Analysis of isolated  synthesized triglycerides by GC-FID and mass spectrometry showed that DHA, EPA, CLA  and linolenic acid were the main fatty acids incorporated into the triglycerides.  DHA and EPA were mostly esterified at the sn-2 position.</description><creator>Zuta, Charles Prince</creator><contributor>Simpson, B. K.

Changes in socio-demographics  highlight the emergence of non-traditional households in Canada and influence the  configuration of a house (or product) which meets buyers' individual requirements.  In turn, this affects the design approach (or process). At the same time, society  today requires sustainability in housing development, since building a house  consumes large amounts of energy during construction and after  occupancy. Technology that improves the cost and performance of housing has  advanced over time. Although some innovative design and construction systems (or  approaches) that attempt to meet societal and individual demands for housing are  available in today's market, homebuilders tend not to apply unfamiliar approaches to  their housing developments, since their business operation is often based on  convention. Another reason, which inhibits a builder's adoption of new housing  technology, is the extra cost required for seeking and analysing information. Thus,  the homebuilders' decision-making processes for the adoption of 'familiar' and  'unfamiliar' design and construction systems (or housing systems) which affect the  configuration of housing need to be well programmed. Accordingly, this study, composed of four parts, focuses  initially on identifying housing market trends and issues in Quebec, as well as  introducing the new concept of mass customisation that encourages homebuilders to  standardise parts of a house---i.e. the creation of mass custom homes. Then, in  consideration of this new concept, as well as a value analysis approach that helps  facilitate homebuilders' buying decisions, it proposes a choice model for the design  and construction approaches to the delivery of 'lower-cost and higher-performance'  housing. Thirdly, to assess its practicality, the proposed decision-making model is  demonstrated in collaboration with a selected homebuilder in Quebec. Finally, the  results of this study are discussed in depth in order to identify future research  opportunities. In view of the demonstration project conducted in this study,  the author concluded that the proposed 'choice model' could function effectively as  a practical decision-making support tool (or system) that helps open the door for  homebuilders to generate and select alternatives that aid them to produce lower-cost  and higher-performance housing. As a consequence of programming the homebuilders'  buying decision-making process, the goal identification uncertainty and  goal/purchase matching uncertainty, which often hinder their adoption of unfamiliar,  innovative housing systems, could be reduced, or eliminated.</description><creator>Noguchi, Masayoshi</creator><contributor>Friedman, Avi (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2004</date><subject>Modular construction -- Qu√©bec (Province)</subject><subject>Housing -- Qu√©bec (Province)</subject><subject>Industrialized building -- Qu√©bec (Province)</subject><subject>Construction industry -- Qu√©bec (Province)</subject><title>A choice model for mass customisation of lower-cost and higher-performance housing in sustainable development /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xk81jk93b.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pz50gw68k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4j03d0206</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:26:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>High-pressure (HP) depresses the phase-transition point of water  especially in the case of ice-I (down to -21¬∞C at about 210 MPa). This  phenomenon has several potential advantages in food processing applications, such as  pressure shift freezing (PSF) and HP thawing. However, scientific knowledge  available in this area is still relatively limited. The main objectives of this  research were to investigate the phase-transition behavior of foods under pressure  processing in the context of PSF and HP thawing techniques and to evaluate their  impact on product quality. Distilled water and fresh pork muscle were tested by a HP  differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) using isothermal pressure scan (P-scan) and  isobaric temperature scan (T-scan). P-scan tests showed that the phase-transition  temperature (T) of pork was a function of the weighted-average pressure  (P¬Ø1--2): T = -1.17 - 0.102P¬Ø1--2 - 0.00019 P¬Ø21-2 (R2 =  0.99) that was much lower than that of pure ice. The phase-change latent heat of  pork was estimated by P-scan. T-scan indicated the phase-transition point at a  constant pressure, but it showed less accurate than P-scan. The ratio (Rice, %) of  ice crystals formed by rapid release of pressure (P) was evaluated using the HP DSC:  Rice-water = 0.115P + 0.00013P2 (R2 = 0.96) for water, and Rice-pork = 0.084P +  0.00012P2 (R2 = 0.95) for pork muscle. In the developed method, the  pressure-dependent thermal properties of test materials are not  required. A preliminary study on ice-crystal formation was carried out  using small gelatin gel samples frozen by conventional air freezing (CAF), liquid  immersion freezing (LIF) and PSF at different pressures. The ovoid structure left  from ice crystals was evaluated for area, equivalent diameter, roundness and  elongation. The diameter (mean +/- S.D.) was 145 +/- 66, 84 +/- 26, 91 +/- 30, 73  +/- 29, and 44 +/- 16 mum for the treatments of CAF, LIF and PSF at 100, 150 and 200  MPa, respectively. Roundness and elongation did not show a clear trend with  different freezing tests. Similar experiments using small-size Atlantic salmon  (Salmo salar) resulted in the diameter of 110 +/- 41, 17 +/- 8.4, 16 +/- 8.8, 8.2.5  and 5.0 +/- 2.1 mum for CAF, LIF and PSF at 100, 150 and 200 MPa, respectively. The  roundness was 0.38 +/- 0.14, 0.55 +/- 0.21, 0.57 +/- 0.18, 0.63 +/- 0.14 and 0.71  +/- 0.14 for the above treatments, respectively.

Understanding masculinity in history, therefore, requires attention to  culture and psychology. The concept of a "crisis of masculinity" cannot  address these dimensions sufficiently and is of little use to the  historian. This analysis of evidence from late medieval England begins with  the social world. Legal records show men defending, and therefore defining,  masculine identity through interaction among male peers and with women. Defamation  suits suggest a fifteenth-century identification of masculinity with  "trueness": an uncomplicated, open honesty. A "true man," in  late medieval England, was not just an honest man, but a real man. Social masculinity constituted honest fairness, permitting  stable social relations between men. Transparent honesty, good management of the  household ("husbandry"), and self-command preserved males' social  substance, their metaphoric embodiment represented tangibly by money and property.  Lawsuits and personal letters show how masculine social identity took shape through  competition and cooperation with other men. "Power," "dominance"  and self-fulfilment were less important than sustaining this network of  relations. Men's relations with women are best understood within this  homosocial dynamic. Men's adultery trespassed on other males' substance, while  women's adultery indicated poor management of one's own. Sexual slander against men  could injure their social identity, but was unlikely to demolish it, as it would for  a woman. The celibate minority of men shared these concerns. Medical texts, late medieval men's clothing, satirical poems,  and courtesy texts prescribing self-control show that the male body provided  important meanings (phallic and otherwise), through failure, inadequacy or excess as  often as not. Sexual activity, and other uses of the body, might be managed  differently as self-restraining or self-indulgent discourses of masculinity  demanded. A psychoanalytic reading of medieval romances reveals fantasized  solutions to the problem of males' desire for feminine and masculine objects.  Romance literature displays a narcissistic subjectivity created in defensive  fantasies of disconnection. Such features derive from a culture demanding incessant  social self-presentation of its men, which permitted very little in daily life to be  kept from the scrutiny of others.</description><creator>Neal, Derek</creator><contributor>Partner, Nancy F.

Because the field of  religious studies has focused on texts, the assumption exists that these are  primary, and performances based on them are mere enactments and therefore  derivative. This thesis will challenge this common assumption by arguing that  performances themselves can be constitutive events in which religious worldviews,  social histories, and group and personal identities are created or re-negotiated. In  this work, I examine the history of performance cultures (understood both as genres  and the groups that develop and perform them) in the Telugu-speaking regions of  South India from the sixteenth century to the present in order to elucidate the  cross-fertilization among various performance spheres over time. My specific focus is on the figure of Satyabhama (lit. True  Woman or Woman of Truth), the favourite wife of the god  K·πõ·π£·πáa. Satyabhama represents a range of  emotions, which makes her character popular with dramatists and other artists in the  Telugu-speaking regions of South India where poets composed hundreds of  performance-texts about her, and several caste groups have enacted her character  through narrative drama. The dissertation is composed of four substantive parts - text,  context, memory, and mimesis. The first part explores the figure of Satyabhama in  the Mahabharata and in three Sanskrit Pura·πáic texts. The second  examines the courtly traditions of poetry and village performances in the Telugu  language, where Satyabhama is innovatively portrayed through aesthetic categories.  The third is based on ethnographic work with women of the contemporary kalavantula  (devadasi) community and looks at the ways in which they identify with Satyabhama  and other female aesthetic archetypes (nayikas). The final section is based on  fieldwork with the smarta Brahmin male community in Kuchipudi village, where men  continue to perform mimetic representations of Satyabhama through a performative  modality known as stri-ve·π£am ("guise of a  woman").</description><creator>Soneji, Davesh</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Theater -- Religious aspects -- Hinduism</subject><subject>Theater -- India, South</subject><subject>SatyabhƒÅma (Hindu mythology)</subject><subject>Archetypes in literature.</subject><title>Performing SatyabhƒÅmƒÅ : text, context, memory and mimesis in Telugu-speaking South India</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sq87bv059.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3t945r28b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Religious Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4t64gn68z</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:26:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The ultimate goal of retroviral infection is to transfer the RNA  genome from one cell to another. This requires that the viral genome be assembled  within the structure of an infectious particle. The Gag precursor in HIV-1 is alone  sufficient to produce viral particles. In order to obtain interactions required for  assembly, the Gag molecules must first be concentrated at a cellular site. Membrane  and RNA have been proposed to act as intracellular scaffolds for aligning Gag  molecules and facilitating their interaction with each other. In vitro studies using  truncated Gag molecules have indicated that RNA is important in facilitating a  membrane-independent interaction between Gag molecules, and that this RNA need not  be viral. During HIV-1 assembly, Gag-Pol is also incorporated into the virus.  Gag-Pol has also been shown also responsible for the selective packaging of  tRNALys3, the primer for reverse transcriptase. The factors facilitating the  interaction between Gag and Gag-Pol, as well as the role of Gag-Po1 in the assembly  process have been less studied. It has been assumed, however, that these molecules  interact with each other through similar sequences involved in Gag/Gag interactions.  Evidence for this includes the fact that unmyristylated Gag or Gag-Pol molecules can  be rescued into assembly complexes by myristylated Gag. In this work, we used COS7 cells transfected with wild type and  mutant HIV-1 proviral DNA to investigate the role of Gag-Pol in viral assembly.  Experiments conducted on lysates of transfected cells revealed an RNA requirement  for Gag/Gag-Pol interaction. Analysis of the effect of mutations within the  nucleocapsid region in either Gag or Gag-Pol precursors indicated that  RNA-facilitated Gag polymerization is required for Gag/Gag-Pol interaction, and not  a direct association of Gag-Pol with RNA. We further examined the selective  packaging of tRNALys3 into viral particles during viral assembly. The effects of  various mutations in Pr160gag-pol upon the incorporation of tRNALys were studied. We  determined that a 54 amino acid sequence in the thumb region of RT within Gag-Pol is  required for tRNA Lys incorporation into the virus, and may contribute to the tRNA  Lys binding site in Pr160gag-pol. These results demonstrate an important role for  Gag-Pol in the assembly process.</description><creator>Khorchid, Ahmad</creator><contributor>Kleiman, Lawrence (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>The role of Pr160gag-pol in HIV-1 assembly /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8910jv12q.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4t64gn68z</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2227mq170</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:26:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Heat pipes have been investigated, developed and applied in many  industrial fields since 1964. However, heat pipe technology is still a relatively  new topic in high heat flux environments such as are encountered in the  metallurgical and energy industries. This study focused on the development of a  novel heat pipe that can be used under high heat flux conditions. The state of the  technology prior to this study was that heat pipes were not suitable for high heat  flux applications. Even though numerous patents have been granted for heat pipes  and related applications, most are based on the basic concepts of the conventional  heat pipe as detailed in the literature. Researchers have found that there are a  number of problems with these heat pipes when they are applied in high heat flux  environments. Thus, it was a prime objective of this study to develop a novel heat  pipe that is suitable for such high heat flux operations. In addition, some basic  fundamental issues regarding the overall makeup of heat pipes were also investigated  and explained. The fundamental study showed that the film boiling phenomenon  can be a serious problem when a conventional heat pipe is used under high heat flux  conditions. Film boiling can make a conventional heat pipe lose its ability for  sustained heat transfer with a small temperature gradient. The flow modified heat pipe that was invented and studied  eliminates film boiling in the evaporator of the heat pipe. In this kind of heat  pipe, a flow-modifier element was introduced into the heat pipe chamber to improve  the heat transfer of the two-phase flow. The experimental data indicated that the  flow modified heat pipe was dramatically better than a conventional heat pipe under  a comparable high heat flux load. This novel heat pipe successfully combined the  flow modified heat pipe and the loop heat pipe and, thus, effectively overcame film  boiling by collapsing the formed films. It was shown that the novel heat pipes are  suitable for high heat flux and high temperature operation where conventional heat  pipes will only function at a fraction of the heat load.</description><creator>Zheng, Guohui, 1962-</creator><contributor>Mucciardi, Frank (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</subject><title>A novel flow-modified heat pipe-development and experimental investigation /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z603qx99n.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2227mq170</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vm40xs09d</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:26:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The three reported articles examine self-mutilation (SM) in a  community sample of adolescents. First, the frequency of the behavior, gender  differences and self-mutilative practices were examined. In addition, two models of  self-mutilation, the anxiety reduction model and hostility model were explored in  order to gain preliminary information regarding possible etiological factors in the  manifestation of self-mutilation. Finally, other related maladaptive behaviors such  as depressive symptomatology and eating pathology were also investigated. Four  hundred and forty students from two schools, an urban and a suburban high school  were given a screening measure designed to assess for SM. Students who indicated  that they hurt themselves on purpose also participated in a follow-up interview.  Based on interviews it was found that 13.9% of all students reported having engaged  in SM behavior on at least one occasion. Girls reported significantly higher rates  of SM than boys. Self-cutting was found to be the most common type of SM, followed  by self-hitting, pinching, scratching and biting. In terms of support for the  models, students who SM reported significantly more anxiety and more intropunitive  and extrapunitive hostility relative to students who did not SM. In addition, prior  to self-mutilating, feelings of both hostility and anxiety were described. Findings  lend support to the hostility model of self-mutilation. Finally, greater depressive  symptomatology and eating pathology were reported by students who SM. Results are  discussed with reference to the anxiety reduction model and the hostility model of  SM.</description><creator>Ross, Shana</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Adolescent psychology.</subject><subject>Self-mutilation.</subject><title>Self-mutilation in a community sample of adolescents : a test of the anxiety model and the hostility model</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zc77sq605.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vm40xs09d</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zg64tm46k</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:26:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In my dissertation, I present Hermann Cohen's foundation for the  history and philosophy of science. My investigation begins with Cohen's formulation  of a neo-Kantian epistemology. I analyze Cohen's early work, especially his  contributions to 19th century debates about the theory of knowledge. I conclude by  examining Cohen's mature theory of science in two works, The Principle of the  Infinitesimal Method and its History of 1883, and Cohen's extensive 1914  Introduction to Friedrich Lange's History of Materialism. In the former, Cohen gives  an historical and philosophical analysis of the foundations of the infinitesimal  method in mathematics. In the latter, Cohen presents a detailed account of Heinrich  Hertz's Principles of Mechanics of 1894. Hertz considers a series of possible  foundations for mechanics, in the interest of finding a secure conceptual basis for  mechanical theories. Cohen argues that Hertz's analysis can be completed, and his  goal achieved, by means of a philosophical examination of the role of mathematical  principles and fundamental concepts in scientific theories.</description><creator>Patton, Lydia</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Science -- History</subject><subject>Cohen, Hermann, 1842-1918</subject><subject>Science -- Philosophy</subject><title>Hermann Cohen's history and philosophy of science</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0k225b555.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zg64tm46k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Philosophy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:df65v841t</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:26:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>High pressure (HP) processing, a novel technology, has excellent  potential for non-thermal preservation of apple juice, the largest consumed fruit  juice in North America. The objective of this research was to evaluate the  application of HP treatment for inactivation of enzymes and destruction of  microorganisms in apple juice. HP inactivation kinetics of selected enzymes  (amylase, pectin methyl esterase and polyphenol oxidase) and microorganisms  [Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Pichia membranaefaciens and Zygosaccharomyces badii,  Escherichia coli (29055) and Escherichia coli (O157:H7)] in apple juice were  evaluated under various test conditions (100--400 MPa, 0--60 min and  6--40¬∞C) using a central composite design of experiments. The enzymes  selected were of importance in apple juice preparation and/or storage stability of  the processed juice. Microorganisms included those that are responsible for spoilage  and/or public health concern as well as those that are indicative of unsanitary  handling conditions. Enzyme inactivation and microbial destruction due to pressure  followed a dual-effect model consisting of a pressure pulse effect (PE) and a  subsequent semi-logarithmic (first order) inactivation during the pressure  hold-time. In general, results showed that inactivation of enzymes and destruction  of microorganisms was more prominent at higher-pressure levels, higher temperature  and longer treatment times, and at lower pH levels of juice. Pressure pulse effect  was dependent on pressure level, with higher PE achieved at higher pressures. During  the pressure-hold, as expected, the associated decimal reduction times (D values)  decreased with an increase in pressure. Pressure dependency of D values was well  described by the conventional death time model. The pressure resistance of enzymes  and microorganisms varied, but complete inactivation of enzymes and destruction of  microorganisms was possible with the combination of lower pH, higher pressure and  higher temperatures. Commercial PME from a citrus source was more pressure sensitive  than PME from microbial source. Spoilage bacteria (L. mesenteroides) were more  pressure resistant than the yeasts. E. coli enumerated on an enrichment media  (supporting both injured and healthy cells) showed larger survivors and a greater  resistance than on a more selective media. An increasing number of cells got injured  than killed with the application of pressure treatment until they were all finally  injured or killed. High-pressure treatment (pulse at 400 MPa or by holding about 10  min at 350 MPa and 30¬∞C) resulted in complete destruction of the pathogenic  microorganism E. coli (O157:H7) ensuring the public health safety of the  process.</description><creator>Riahi, Esmaeil</creator><contributor>Ramaswamy, H.

The studies presented here observed the cellular and subcellular  response to the process of islet isolation. The first paper made the primary  observation of apoptosis after isolation, as manifested by the appearance of  apoptotic bodies, DNA fragmentation, and the activation of the enzyme tissue  transglutaminase. Importantly, the fact that cell death in this context is  apoptotic, and therefore a programmed response to discrete stimuli, suggests that it  could be avoided or minimized by manipulation of the cellular  milieu. The second paper in this thesis examined the changes in activity  of signal transduction pathways known to mediate the effects of extracellular stress  and to balance growth and death promoting signals. Activation of these  intermediates, the MAP kinases JNK, ERK and p38, was seen to fluctuate after  isolation, representing perhaps a loss of survival signals and a rise in those  promoting apoptosis. The final three experiments examined ways to improve cell  survival after isolation by manipulating the MAP kinase pathways. The first mediator  of survival tested was insulin itself, and this was found to reduce apoptotic cell  death, and primarily activate p38 and ERK, while inhibiting the response of JNK. The  existence of an autocrine signaling loop was proposed to explain this  effect. The insulin-like growth factors also diminished cell death, by  signaling primarily through the PI3 kinase/Akt system and also through ERK.  Inhibition of any of these pathways was clearly detrimental to cell survival.  Finally, the action of the immunosuppressive tacrolimus was shown to protect against  cytokine-induced apoptosis, and may inhibit JNK as well as activating survival  pathways. These experiments demonstrated that cell loss through apoptosis  is common after islet isolation, and by manipulating the signal transduction  pathways governing this process, islet survival can be improved, hopefully leading  to the use of higher quality grafts and resulting in improved outcomes.

Activation of proteases belonging to the caspase and  calpain family has been implicated in the mediation of programmed cell death in  acute injury and chronic neurodegenerative disorders. The main risk factor for  Alzheimer's disease, aging, is associated with a gradual impairment of critical  cellular homeostasis processes such as glucose metabolism, mitochondrial integrity  and scavenging of reactive oxygen species. These changes in concert with  dysmetabolism of the amyloid precursor protein and/or the microtubule associated  protein Tau may compromise cell function beyond a threshold that commits neurons to  die. Programmed cell death, a highly regulated pathway that entails an organized  disassembly of the cell may contribute to the progression of neuropathology in  Alzheimer's disease. Using antibodies to neo-epitopes generated by  caspase-3-mediated cleavage of the amyloid precusor protein and spectrin, I have  localized by immunohistochemistry these caspase-3-generated neo-epitopes in  autopsied Alzheimer's and age-matched control brains, as well as in the forebrain of  rats that have been subjected to axotomy of the septo-hippocampal pathway. Elevated  levels of caspase-3-cleaved amyloid precursor protein were detected in Alzheimer's  disease with respect to age-matched control brains. Immunopositive profiles were  observed in particulate elements resembling dystrophic neurites, as well as in  dense-core neuritic plaques, and in a subpopulation of neurons and glial cells.  Caspase-3 cleaved amyloid precursor protein co-localized with some TUNEL-positive  cortical neurons indicating that DNA fragmentation was indeed occurring in neurons  undergoing programmed cell death.
