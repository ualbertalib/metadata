Lodging is one of the most serious hazards which limit the amount of chemical fertilizers that may be applied to this crop. There are more than one kinds of lodging.

Their measured receiving patterns were found to compare favourably with simple theoretical predictions provided that an external circuit was used for the purpose of eliminating those undesirable excitations which are not directly caused by the incident magnetic field. A type of probe developed earlier in the practice of direction finding was used in these experiments to measure magnetic fields with greater efficiency and greater ease of construction than the loop probes usually employed for such measurements. The above studies were made with the ultimate view of adapting these probes for work at microwave frequencies in the region of 3 cm. wavelengths. The experiments indicate that the type of probe investigated can be adapted for measurements at microwave frequencies where probes without the external compensating circuit had failed so far.</description><creator>Beaulieu, Jacques.

The primary aim of this thesis is to investigate this perception and attribution in indviduals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and compare this with typical adults and children. Chapter 1 comprises a literature review of music and emotion, and of music cognition in individuals with ASD. The first manuscript (Chapter 2) describes the development of a new method for investigating perception of emotion from musical performance. Using this method, we found that typical adults can reliably rate the emotional content of musical performances which vary in expressive parameters. In the second manuscript (Chapter 3), we used this method to examine the ability of adolescents with ASD to rate the emotional content of musical performance. We compared the group with ASD to a group of typically developing adolescents as well as a group of individuals with Williams syndrome (WS). The results of this study showed that adolescents with ASD are impaired in this kind of emotional recognition relative to both comparison groups. Emotional recognition is an important aspect of everyday social interactions, both in understanding and predicting others' actions. Thus, in the third manuscript (Chapter 4), we examined the effect of musical soundtracks on attribution of social action and intent in ASD by adding music to an established visual task.

Lepremier chapitre est consacre a une revue de la litterature portant sur la musiqueet les emotions ainsi que sur la cognition de la musique chez des individuspresentant un TSA. Le premier manuscrit (chapitre 2) porte sur le developpement d'une nouvelle methode permettant d'evaluer la perception desemotions associees a des performances musicales.

The system of measurement incorporates a process of recording the noise magnetically and later playing the noise back for analysis at a much higher speed. The process makes low frequency noise measurable by conventional apparatus in the audio frequency range. The apparatus has been tested and found to be linear and independent of frequency in its range of use. The noise power spectra of a 6SJ7 pentode has been measured. Above 10 kc/s shot noise predominated, at lower frequencies flicker noise became important. The l/f-spectrum flicker noise was observed to exist down to 0.02 c/s, the lower frequency limit of the apparatus.</description><creator>Armstrong, Robert. A.</creator><contributor>Woonton, G.

This farm is now part of the city of Johannesburg (see Plate 1). The gold was discovered in a conglomerate bed, later to be known as the Main Reef. As this conglomerate was traced along its outcrop, it was quickly realised that a new and important goldfield had been discovered. That this view was justified is evident from Plate l, which shows all the areas held under mining lease today in the Transvaal and Orange Free State, totalling some 700 sq. miles.</description><creator>Antrobus, Edmund.

The most important of these are the electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram and electromyogram. All are a measure of the electrical activity within the tissues of the organ under study.

This writer spent the summers of 1950, 1951, and 1952 in the area, while in the employ of Jalore Mining Company, Limited. During this time he examined the regional setting and the detailed geology of the iron formations and other rock formations, and wrote a Master of Science thesis on the Lucy Orebody. In the course of these investigations he became aware that much could still be added to the geologic picture, especially concerning the problems of the genesis of the iron formation, and the structure of the area.</description><creator>Young, William.

His classical study of the pressure-volume isotherms of carbon dioxide indicated that the liquid-vapour region was defined by a roughly parabolic boundary, the coexistence curve. The isotherm passing through the apex of such a parabola would therefore represent the critical temperature, the apex itself being designated as the critical point.</description><creator>Whiteway, Stirling.

The reaction that occurs as a result of the irradiation may be insignificant in that no recognizable injury is apparent during the life of the recipient; the effects may be insidious and appear only after a lapse of many generations; or the results may be ruinous with death resulting within a short time. The biological response to radiations might thus represent a number of manifestations all of which might be expected to have a common etiology.</description><creator>Whitehead, Howard.
