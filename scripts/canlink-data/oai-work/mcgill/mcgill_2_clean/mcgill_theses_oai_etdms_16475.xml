This process begins with the proliferation of spermatogonia by mitosis; then follows meiotic division of the spermatocytes with the resultant production of spermatids. These spermatids, without further division, transform slowly into spermatozoa which are subsequently released into the tubular lumen. This latter process of transformation is referred to as spermiogenesis. It is well known that spermatogenesis is under the influence of hormones.</description><creator>Harvey, Stuart.

In spite of extensive and varied investigations in the field and laboratory, the chemical mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. During the past decade, mainly through the pioneering work of Garrels (1960) and co-workers, the concept of thermodynamic mineral equilibria has been applied to reactions occurring in aqueous solutions at surface or near surface conditions. Mineral relationships in the zones of oxidation and supergene enrichment have been graphically portrayed by Garrels (1954) in Eh-pH diagrams by means of thermodynamic calculations following the methods of Pourbaix (1949).</description><creator>Hansuld, John.

Morse showed in his thesis in 1917 that it would be sufficient to demonstrate the existence of a recurrent non-periodic sequence with a finite number of generators. That such a sequence exists Morse then proved by producing an example. The sequence he defined had two generators, hence is an example of a recurrent non-periodic binary sequence. These results were published by Morse in 1921 (1). It was subsequently discovered by H.M. Morse and G. A. Hedlund (2) that this sequence had other interesting applications.</description><creator>Hanks, Wilfred. G.</creator><contributor>Lambek, J.

The tests, using both methods, are described for a number of available materials. The results are in good agreement. It was found that a uniform coating of the entire vibrating surface did not correspond to the highest damping efficiency. An equivalent circuit, based on electro-mechanical analogies, was derived. This circuit proved to be a powerful technique in the study of vibration damping, and some of its parameters were combined in a universal curve.  One viscoelastic material was chosen for most efficient application to a ventilation-duct model. At one anti-node the velocity-amplitude was reduced by 78.9%.</description><creator>Hamid, Mahmud.

Even complex high polymers that are products of the modern synthetic laboratory are known to serve as microbial substrates under appropriate test conditions (Zobell, 1946; Quastel, 1959). The failure of the accumulation of organic materials, except under conditions not favourable for decomposition, is ample evidence for the turnover of elemental substances. Thus the occurrence of an organic material either in a natural or synthetic condition of necessity makes it subject to biological transformations for an effective balance of the world’s supply of available elements.</description><creator>Halvorson, Harvest.</creator><contributor>Blackwood, A.

Significant species and sex differences were detected. Maturation brought a large increase of serum hexosamine in female fowls and pigs, a small increase in cows, and no increase in humans. The effects of pregnancy in cows and exercise and diet in rats were also studied. In another study the effects of gonadal hormones, administered to immature fowl, on the levels of serum hexosamine, protein, glucuronic acid, sugar and calcium were investigated. Hydrolysis of serum with a polystyrene resin gave higher estimates of hexosamine content than hydrolysis or serum with 4 N hydrochloric acid and subsequent chromatography. A reliable estimate of the glucuronic acid content ofserum could not be obtained by a direct determination, but a relatively reliable estimate may be obtained after resin hydrolysis of serum and purification of hydrolyzate by passing it through cationic and anionic exchange resin columns.</description><creator>Grant, Donald.

In complex activities such as playing a musical instrument, reading, or speaking, there are no inherent relations between elements (notes or words) to determine the order in which they are produced. This essential organization, therefore, seems to depend more on central mediating factors within the organism than on immediate sensory controls. A logical inference from this is that there is a developmental growth in the level of behavioral complexity of which the individual is capable, i.e., that the ability to organize increasingly complicated response sequences becomes more manifest with age.</description><creator>Gottschalk, Judith.</creator><contributor>Rabinovitch, M.

Under the policy of wardship, these images developed into stereotypical views. The government's goals of protection, civilization and assimilation, pertaining to Indian women residing on prairie reserves from 1880 to 1930, were to be accomplished by restructuring the domestic economy on reserve. Government and churches attempted to c hange this economy through formal instruction of Indian women in the domestic skills. Later, attempts were made to teach them to be better mothers. The state's view of Indians as inadequate housekeepers and inattentive mothers reinforced efforts to alter the way of life on reserves. Moreover, the stereotype of domestic slovenliness served to mask causes of endemic tuberculosis on the reserves . By 1930, the Canadian state had intervened in most areas of Indian womens' lives. This occurred well before unive rsal social programs were established.</description><description>L'image de la femme Amerindienne qu'ont rapportee les explorateurs et les trappeurs du Nord-ouest a influence de facon significative les premieres politiques du gouvernemnt canadien a l'egard de mis en tutelle du gouvernement federeal transformera ensuite progressivement cette perception en stereotypes.

Constructional features included two measuring weirs for inflow to and a measuring weir for outflow from the Lake. Installation of a class "A" evaporation pan with all instrumentations were done to register all parameters to compute water surface evaporation. These were compared with results from empirical formulae. Comparative calculations concerning applicability of meteorological data of McGill University and St. Hubert Air Base meteorological stations were made. Rainfall - runoff relations were analysed measuring inflow by the two measuring weirs taking into account base flow and surface runoff. From such observational findings the derivation of a runoff coefficient for this area was aimed at. Complete computations for all phases of the analysis were tabulated in the text of the thesis.</description><creator>Goswami, Santosh. R.</creator><contributor>Pakalnins, A.

The starting point when trying to determine the band structure of a crystalline material is to employ one or another type of approximation to obtain the general form of the structure of energy bands. This general form usually contains certain parameters whose theoretical calculation is difficult or prohibitive. Thus we resort to experiments to determine the values of these parameters and consequently the exact band structure. To establish the validity of an approximation we have to show that the model based on this approximation can explain the physical properties of the material.</description><creator>Geher, Leslie.</creator><contributor>Wallace, P.

Any study that did or will reveal some of the unknowns of this phenomenon in grassland will be a step in the direction that will ultimately permit the attainment of the ideal pasture plant community. However, presently, until more is known, especially on the value of competition as it occurs in hay end pasture swards, any attempt to come forth with recommendations on the compounding of forage mixtures may be rather vain, because these will be only temporary.</description><creator>Gasser, Heinz.</creator><contributor>Steppler, H.

Infection on two of these lower leaves increases the concentration of radioactivity in them, especially around lesions, but has no marked and consistent effect on the concentration in other organs. Infection on the presentation leaf reduces photosynthesis and export of C14 to other parts. Heat girdling of petioles of healthy and infected leaves show that in both cases, C14 export takes place through phloem and its import through xylem. Radioactivity in detached leaves exposed to C14O2 , either in light or in darkness, is uniformly distributed in healthy leaves, but accumulates around lesions in diseased ones. Starch has similar distribution. Pathological increase in transpiration and metabolic activity are probably responsible for the altered cl4 distribution in diseased leaves.</description><creator>Garraway, Michael.

Jahrhundert ist eine Blütezeit des Gesellschaftsromans. In England analysieren die Romane der früh-viktorianischen Epoche hauptsachlich das dortige Bürgertum. In Frankreich sind die Helden der Romane Balzacs fast ausnahmslos Geschopfe der kraftstrotzenden, geldgierigen Epoche, in der die Bürger zur politischen Führung gelangten. Flaubert schildert mit viel Verachtung die Menschen seiner Zeit, Hugo mit mehr Verstandnis und Gefühl für die Entrechteten. Zola malt mit der Geschichte der Rougon-Macquart die Geschicke seiner Zeit und ihrer Menschen.

On the other hand, it seems preferable to choose one model and explore its possibilities thoroughly before discarding it in the hope that there may be a common denominator to all carcinogenic processes. This thesis will attempt to show that by the use of a well-established experimental model, but by adding newer techniques, new and valuable information can be obtained. The two-stage production of papillomata in the skin of mice was chosen for several reasons. Training in this subject under experienced guidance is available in a favourable university environment. The basic experimental technique has been well established, and much information on it is available.</description><creator>Frei, Jaroslav. V.</creator><contributor>Ritchie, A.

The geodesic equations contain the Christoffel symbols of the second kind, field variables which effectively take the place of the force of classical theory. The question arises, whether these equations can properly be called equations of motion, if the Christoffel symbols are singular at the location of the particle; for this is the case with the only solution of the field equations in empty space which is static, has spherical symmetry, and which goes over into the flat metric at infinity, i.e. the Schwartzschild solution.</description><creator>Frank, Barry.</creator><contributor>Morris, T.
