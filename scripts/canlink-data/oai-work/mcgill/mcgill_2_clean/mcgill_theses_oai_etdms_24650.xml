The study consists of new  symbol-timing estimation algorithm and new optimal interpolation filters. The  proposed feed-forward STR algorithms are optimal in the sense of maximum-likelihood  estimation. Estimations are very accurate and converge rapidly within a preamble  length as short as 4 symbols, suitable to burst-mode modems. In addition, they can  operate at a sampling rate as low as twice the symbol rate. The proposed synthesis  method of the optimal interpolation filters is optimal in the sense of minimum  mean-square error jointly in time, and frequency domain, and symbol-timing  estimation error. Mathematical derivations, analysis, simulations, and implemented  structures of the new algorithms are presented. Oversampling techniques combined  with interpolation are studied to achieve better accuracy with a cost in increasing  implementation complexity and lowering operational clock rate.</description><creator>Vo, Nguyen Doan, 1975-</creator><contributor>Le-Ngoc, Tho (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Efficient all-digital symbol-timing recovery techniques for burst-mode demodulators</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7w62f884v.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/df65v8555</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wd375w97b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) are  increasingly being used in various photonic applications. In order to design an  optical system which will transmit the light emitted by a VCSEL it is necessary to  model the intensity profile. The purpose of this thesis is to apply a method of  extracting the modal content from an intensity profile assumed to be composed of  Hermite-Gauss modes. This will be done for both the simulated output of a VCSEL and  for experimentally measured intensity profiles. It will be demonstrated that the  method will produce an accurate model for a VCSEL output which is close to being  ideally Hermite-Gauss. Two experimental setups used to measure the intensity  profiles will be presented. The first uses a scanning near-field optical microscope  (SNOM) to measure the intensity near the surface of the VCSEL. In the second setup  the intensity is measured at the output of a two-lens system used to image the beam  waist.</description><creator>Varano, Robert</creator><contributor>Kirk, Andrew G.

The method relies on special video hardware capable  of simultaneously generating low-speed, high-resolution frames and high-speed,  low-resolution frames. The algorithm follows an estimate-and-correct approach, in  which a high-resolution estimate is first produced by translating the pixels of the  high-resolution frames produced by the camera with respect to the motion dynamic  observed in the low-resolution ones. The estimate is then compared against the  current low-resolution frame and corrected locally as necessary for consistency with  the latter. This is done by replacing the wrong pixels of the estimate with pixels  from a bilinear interpolation of the current low-resolution frame. Because of their  longer exposure time, high-resolution frames are more prone to motion blur than  low-resolution frames, so a motion blur reduction step is also applied. Simulations  demonstrate the ability of our technique in synthesizing high-quality,  high-resolution frames at modest computational expense.</description><creator>Pelletier, St√©phane</creator><contributor>Cooperstock, Jeremy R.

People already do process measurement and compare  these measurements to internal or regulatory standards. The innovation in this  thesis is the development of an algorithm for process comparison that accommodates  any process, responds to any kind of semantic junction in the process model, deals  with uncertain process data, and compares all or part of a process. This is done by  the activity-by-activity comparison of data and measurements from an actual process  to a model of a process. IDEF3 diagrams were used for process modeling, a modified PERT  network technique was used for process comparison, and the technique incorporated  fuzzy data and metric comparison. Solutions of practical problems showed that the algorithm does  not have any limitations for process comparison. While the test data were for time  performance only, other metrics can easily be accommodated, such as cost, quality,  human resource or energy.</description><creator>Nayestani, Naynaz</creator><contributor>Thomson, Vince (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Engineering, Industrial.</subject><title>A process comparison algorithm /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/st74cr030.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8623hz30d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n009w2917</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Recently, Huang and Carrington introduced a preconditioned  inexact spectral transform (PIST) method for calculating energy levels and wave  functions in quantum mechanics. Mathematically, the PIST method is a new iterative  technique for solving eigenvalue problems. It gives both eigenvalues and  eigenfunctions within a prescribed eigenvalue spectrum. The method requires storing  only a small number of vectors but allows one to calculate eigenvalues and  wavefunctions with far fewer matrix-vector products than the conventional Lanczos  method used for solving eigenvalue problems. We present here a numerical solution of  the scalar Helmholtz wave equation using the PIST technique in solving the  associated eigenvalue problem. In this work, we first convert the scalar Helmholtz wave  equation to an eigenvalue problem: we use the basis function expansion method, i.e.  by expanding the unknown electrical field function in a complete set of orthogonal  basis functions, the differential equation can be converted to a matrix eigenvalue  equation. The propagation constants and mode field distributions can be obtained  from the solution of the corresponding matrix eigenvalue problem. The method can handle any type of eigenvalue spectrum, in  particular if the eigenvalue spectrum contains only one guided mode. Furthermore the  algorithm can give distinct orthogonal eigenfunctions associated with degenerate  propagation constants. We have written a user-friendly and modularized computer  program. The program can handle arbitrary index profiles and geometrical shapes by  merely changing the input files that describe the index profile. The method proves  to be efficient, versatile, and requires less memory than popular finite difference  and finite element methods. We show examples of its application for optical waveguide  modeling in finding the propagation constants and mode field distributions of  various waveguides and couplers. For couplers, the method can give the global  evolution of the electrical field.</description><creator>Huang, Shiwei, 1962-</creator><contributor>Chen, Lawrence R.

For steady flows, the boundary conditions are expressed in terms  of the source distributions over wing surfaces. Specific theoretical solutions are  derived for the calculations of pressure coefficient distribution and the lift,  pitching moment, and rolling moment coefficients. The present solutions have been  validated for delta and trapezoidal wings by comparison with high order conical flow  results based on the theory developed by Carafoli, Mateescu, and Nastase. An  excellent agreement was found between these results. For unsteady flows, the boundary conditions of finite span wings  are modeled by using pulsating sources distributing over the wing surface. The  present method leads to more accurate solutions for rigid wings executing harmonic  oscillations in translation, pitching rotation, and rolling rotation of various  oscillating frequencies. These solutions were found in very good agreement with the  available high order conical flow solutions obtained by Carafoli, Mateescu, and  Nastase. Then the method has been used to obtain solutions for the  flexible wings executing flexural oscillations, which are of interest for the  aeroelastic studies in the aeronautical applications.</description><creator>Huang, Chih-Wei, 1974-</creator><contributor>Mateescu, Dan (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Physics, Fluid and Plasma.</subject><subject>Engineering, Aerospace.</subject><title>Analysis of unsteady flows past oscillating wings</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g158bh86k.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8w32r6248</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bz60cw94f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In recent years there have been many reports of methods for  inferring the molecular weight distribution (MWD) of linear polymers from either  viscosity data or dynamic data. This subject is of great interest in the polymer  industry, since MWD affects the processing and final properties of polymers, and gel  permeation chromatography (GPC), normally used for determining MWD, has several  limitations. There are two main types of method for inferring the MWD from  rheological data. The first one involves empirical transformations that lead  directly to a MWD, whereas the second type involves the inversion of an integral  that gives the relaxation modulus G(t) of a polydisperse polymer in terms of its  MWD. A comparison of the reliabilities of these methods for use with samples having  a wide variety of polydispersities is lacking, especially for materials with high  polydispersities. This study presents a comparison of the MWD predictions of four of  these techniques in terms of their performance with groups of HDPEs, LLDPEs and  polypropylenes having polydispersities from two to six and various molecular  weights. It was found that the viscosity transform (as modified by Wood-Adams) and a  modified time-dependent diffusion reptation model proposed by des Cloizeaux (TDD-DR  model) are, to a certain extent, satisfactory methods for use with polymers having  moderate to high polydispersities, whereas the modulus transform is reliable only  for narrow distributions.</description><creator>Baqueiro Avila, Miguel</creator><contributor>Dealy, John M.

One of the most common iron disorders is autosomal  recessive disease---hereditary hemochromatosis, which leads to the iron overload in  population of northern European descent. During years of my graduate research, I  focused on the study of Hemochromatosis gene Hfe and a point mutation C282Y that  leads to more than 80% of all hemochromatosis cases. Iron Regulatory Proteins (IRPs), which serve as main  posttranscriptional regulators of cellular iron homeostasis, are the other interest  of research. Iron regulatory proteins reversibly interact with iron regulatory  elements (IREs) within ferritin and transferrin receptor (TfR) mRNAs. The binding  ability of IRPs is under tight control so that they respond to the changes in the  intracellular iron requirements in a coordinate manner by differentially regulating  ferritin mRNA translational efficiency and TfR mRNA stability. Besides intracellular  iron levels, some other stimuli, such as oxidative stress, are capable of regulating  this RNA-protein interactions.</description><creator>Xue, Yue, 1978-</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>Iron metabolism in mammalian cells</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3t945r40m.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bc386j83m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0p096770s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Nepheline syenite represents the highly differentiated product  of fractional crystallization in the Poudrette quarry at Mont Saint-Hilaire, Quebec.  It also records a significant subsolidus overprint due to circulation of  post-magmatic fluids. Annite, the ferrous-iron-dominant member of the biotite  series, represents up to 20% of the typical nepheline syenites. Hand samples cover the complete range of freshness, from  unaltered to hydrothermally modified rocks. Identification of minerals and  estimation of their abundances and compositions were obtained with optical  microscopy and electron-microprobe analysis. I also used a combined approach of  X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron  microscopy. With respect to annite composition, Fe/(Fe + Mg) varies from  0.74 (porphyntic nepheline syenite) to 0.98 (poikilitic nepheline syenite).  Concerning the habit of annite, the melt composition controls the order of  crystallization, which then in turn controls whether the annite is bladed and  skeletal or oikocrystic. The rock from the Poudrette dyke is a hypersolvus nepheline  syenite in which the bladed annite was a liquidus phase; therefore, the order of  crystallization was "normal" (mafic mineral first), whereas in poikilitic  nepheline syenite, this order was reverse. The proportion of Ti decreases with  Fe/(Fe + Mg), whereas that of Mn increases; F and Cl contents are very low in spite  of their availability. The application of n-alkylammonium cation exchange reveals the  presence of planar structural defects as a result of dehydrogenation-type reactions.  The annite records the results of oxidation during cooling, i.e., open-system  behavior in this degassing pluton.</description><creator>Zangooi, Azin</creator><date>2002</date><subject>Geology.</subject><subject>Mineralogy.</subject><title>Magmatic evolution and subsolidus alteration of annite in nepheline syenites, Mont Saint-Hilaire, Qu√©bec</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4x51hj71h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0p096770s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vm40xs29w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Chlorinated aromatic compounds are an important group of  compounds. Many of them have been produced in large quantities and they are  indispensable to technological and societal benefits. But regulatory agencies have  tightened regulations on the use and release of chlorinated aromatic compounds  because of the scientific understanding of their toxicity, persistence, behavior in  the environment and their potential to cause adverse effects on the ecosystem and  human health. Pentachlorophenol (PCP), octachloronaphthalene and  decachlorobiphenyl are all highly chlorinated aromatic compounds, of which, PCP has  been used mainly as a biocide. Octachloronaphthalene and decachlorobiphenyl don't  have practical use, but their congeners have been used widely as chemicals in  industry. These compounds are toxic, recalcitrant and bio-accumulated within  organisms. As the conventional treatment, incineration of these compounds can cause  more serious problems, so that suitable alternatives need to be developed for their  detoxification. When compared with biodegradation or the thermal treatment of  these compounds, chemical degradations have several merits.

SMAD4 itself has been firmly  established as a tumor suppressor while despite the massive information gathered on  TGF-beta signaling the contribution of SMAD4 inactivation in tumor progression  remains elusive. It is largely unknown which particular genes involved in tumor  progression require SMAD4 for their transcriptional regulation. Smad4-/- murine  fibroblasts were shown to display normal growth inhibition in response to TGF-beta  and we hypothesized that in Smad4-/- tumors there are as yet unidentified  physiological targets of Smad4 involved in tumor progression. A cDNA microarray was  performed on Smad4+/+ and -/- murine fibroblasts with and without TGF-beta  stimulation in order to identify genes that were deregulated in the absence of  Smad4. Several potential novel targets were identified and confirmed by RT-PCR and  Northern analysis. Consistent with the role of Smad4 as a tumor suppressor, when  Smad4 is inactivated, fibroblasts appear to present with an increase in factors that  enhance angiogenesis and a decrease in factors that inhibit the degradation of the  extracellular matrix. This could potentially lead to an increased vascularization of  tumors and an augmentation of metastatic ability. Further, in the absence of Smad4,  TGF-beta stimulation appears to amplify the deregulation of target genes, a  mechanism which could potentially enhance tumor progression in Smad4-/-  tumors.</description><creator>Thorarinsdottir, Thorhildur</creator><contributor>Sirard, Christian (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Identification of Smad4 transcriptional target genes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0g354f876.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vx021f87q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k930bx765</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Residual dipolar couplings have been introduced recently as a  new type of experimental constraints in biomolecular structure determination by  nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).

This results in  a partial cancellation of anisotropic interactions such as the chemical shift  anisotropy (CSA), the quadrupolar coupling and the dipolar coupling. Because the  alignment is weak, only strong interactions manifest. These measurements can be used  to refine structure or to define folds in structural genomics projects.

The radical adduct  reaction products (diamagnetic species), of hydroxyl (HO¬∑) and superoxide  (O2 -¬∑) radicals with phosphorus containing nitroxides, were determined  to be relatively stable and as a result the 31P NMR chemical shifts for these  species were determined. Their structures were verified and quantified using 31P NMR  in the presence of a phosphorus containing internal standard. The 31P NMR chemical  shifts for 5-diisopropylphosphoryl-5-methyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DIPPMPO) and  5-diethoxyphosphoryl-5-methyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DEPMPO) spin traps with a variety  of carbon centered radicals were also determined. A novel equilibrium reaction involving molecular oxygen and  alkaline hydrogen peroxide was investigated and it was found that the concentration  of superoxide radicals present in a system of alkaline hydrogen peroxide is affected  by the nature of gas with which it is in equilibrium. The concentration of  superoxide radicals was determined to be significantly larger than that of hydroxyl  radicals at elevated pH values. Experiments have shown that NMR in conjunction with spin  trapping can be a valuable tool for the detection and quantification of radical  species.</description><creator>Smith, Kamilah</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Chemistry, Analytical.</subject><subject>Chemistry, Organic.</subject><title>Semi-quantitative detection of free radicals using spin trapping and phosphorus-31 NMR spectroscopy</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6w924c340.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jq085k75j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z316q2072</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We present a framework for detecting degenerate probes in a DNA  microarray that may add to measurement error in hybridization experiments. We  consider four types of behaviour: secondary structure formation, self-dimerization,  cross-hybridization and dimerization. The framework uses a well-established model of  nucleic acid sequence hybridization and a novel method for the detection of patterns  in hybridization experiment data. Our primary result is the identification of unique  patterns in hybridization experiment data that are correlated with each type of  degenerate probe behaviour. The framework also contains a machine learning technique  to learn from the hybridization experiment data. We implement the components of the  framework and evaluate the ability of the framework to detect degenerate probes in  the Affymetrix HuGeneFL GeneChip.</description><creator>Smith, Kaleigh</creator><contributor>Hallett, Michael (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Artificial Intelligence.</subject><subject>Computer Science.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Towards quality control in DNA microarrays</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6108vb99d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z316q2072</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vt150j84n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The objective of the research was to carry out the biogeneration  of lipophenols by enzymatic esterification of tricaprylin and caprylic acid with  catechin and catechol in a model hexane system. Commercial lipases, including Lipase  N from Rhizopus niveus, Lipozyme IM from Mucor miehei and Novozym 435 from Candida  antarctica were used throughout this study. The effects of reaction time, incubation  temperatures and agitation speeds on enzymatic hydrolytic activity were investigated  to determine the optimal conditions for biocatalysis. The optimal temperatures for  biocatalysis were determined to be 37.5¬∞C for Lipase N, and 55¬∞C for  Lipozyme IM and Novozym 435; the optimum agitation speed was 100 rpm. Using Lipase  N, maximum hydrolysis of 1.66 mumol free fatty acids/mL was obtained after 1.5 days  of incubation, while with Lipozyme IM, maximum hydrolysis of 8.1 and 8.5 mumol free  fatty acids/mL was obtained after 1 and 4 days, respectively. With Novozym 435, the  highest hydrolysis of 4.0 and 6.1 mumol free fatty acids/mL were found after 2 and 9  days, respectively.</description><creator>Petel, Tamara</creator><contributor>Kermasha, Selim (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Lipase.</subject><subject>Phenols.</subject><subject>Esterification.</subject><subject>Food -- Biotechnology.</subject><subject>Lipids in human nutrition.</subject><title>Biogeneration of lipophenols by lipases using selected substrate models</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q811kk21q.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vt150j84n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7w62f886d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Knowing the tissues, cells, and sub-cellular compartments where  a protein is expressed can provide important insights about its biological and  physiological roles. CDP/Cux is a transcription factor that is proteolytic processed  as cells progress from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. With the aim of  investigating CDP/Cux expression in tissues and in tissue culture cells, I  characterized a panel of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies raised against various  regions of the protein. I established an immunohistochemistry assay and demonstrated  that CDP/Cux is expressed in certain epithelial cells in several tissues. Using the  technique of immunofluorescence I studied the localization of CDP/Cux proteins  throughout the cell cycle. I obtained results suggesting that CDP/Cux isoforms may  localize to different compartments during S phase. Finally, using 3 different  antibodies, I showed that cathepsin L, the potential protease that cleaves CDP/Cux,  may translocate to the nucleus during progression through the cell  cycle.</description><creator>Poirier, Madeleine</creator><contributor>Nepveu, Alain (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>The expression of CDP/Cux in mammals /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8049g571b.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7w62f886d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Surgical Research</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nv935361x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:34Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The present investigation explored and compared the subjective  responses of patients in the stable-phase of schizophrenia being treated with either  olanzapine or risperidone. Several well-established, self-report inventories were  used in this investigation, providing a means of assessing the impact of these  medications from the perspective of the patient. The mean dosage of olanzapine  (15.0mg) and risperidone (4.2mg) used in the present investigation were in line with  treatment guidelines and standards of care. Findings include a highly knowledgeable  sample of patients, who are satisfied with the information provided regarding their  medication and treatment. Patients in both treatment groups were found to possess  positive attitudes towards their medication, and a relatively high overall level of  well-being and health-related quality of life. The majority of patients, in both  treatment groups, expressed a high degree of satisfaction with various life domains,  including their mental health services and their general health status.

The Java Virtual Machine Specification of valid bytecode is much  less restrictive than the Java Language Specification of valid Java source programs.  For example, bytecode has unstructured control flow, loose local typing, and few  restrictions on method modifiers. By contrast, the Java language has highly  structured control flow, strong local typing, and many restrictions on its method  modifiers. The goal of this thesis was to build a tool that could correctly  decompile the widest range of verifiable Java bytecode back into compilable Java  source. This includes bytecode coming from other source languages, bytecode that has  undergone certain types of obfuscation, and optimized bytecode. To accomplish this  goal we created the Structure Encapsulation Tree data structure and a set of new  decompiling algorithms. The algorithms fall into three categories: regular control flow,  exceptional control flow, and idioms.</description><creator>Miecznikowski, Jerome</creator><contributor>Hendren, L.

The HHP treatment caused 10 to 20% denaturation of lysozyme  whereas microwave irradiation caused 20 to 40% denaturation, with more destruction  to the lysozyme in the presence of glucose compared to the control. The extent of  glycation was also higher with the high pressure samples, causing 60% glycation upon  8 hours of high pressure exposure, but decreasing to around 40% thereafter.  Microwave irradiation brought about 40% glycation to the lysozyme samples upon 20  min of irradiation. BSA, on the other hand, was more susceptible to damage by high  energy exposures. BSA samples were denatured to a greater extent compared to  lysozyme, up to 80% upon the prolonged exposures, but in all treatments, glucose  seemed to act as a protectant contrary to the case of lysozyme. The extent of  glycation detected was also minimal, ranging from 8 to 20%. The feasibility of analyzing glycated proteins using  pyrolysis-GC/MS was also investigated. Taking advantage of the formation of a  diagnostic marker---2,3-dihydro-3,5-dihydroxy-6-methyl-4H-pyran-4-one---upon  pyrolysis of glycated proteins, the intensity of this peak was used to correlate the  extent of glycation. The intensity of this peak in the pyrograms of glycated  lysozymes was found to increase linearly with increasing incubation times and  subsequently with the sugar loads of the glycated lysozyme. In addition, using the  pyrograms as unique fingerprints, the extent of structural changes between modified  and unmodified proteins were also assessed.</description><creator>Li, Pik Kei, 1978-</creator><contributor>Yaylayan, V.

Points-to  analysis is a technique for computing this information that has been studied  extensively over the last decade. Most of this research has focused on points-to  analyses for C. The behaviour of points-to analysis on higher-level languages such  as Java appears very different than on C. Moreover, most proposed points-to analysis  techniques were evaluated in disparate analysis systems and benchmarks, making it  difficult to compare their effectiveness. To address these issues, this thesis introduces SPARK, a  flexible framework for experimenting with points-to analyses for Java. S PARK is  intended to be a universal framework within which different points-to analyses can  be easily implemented and compared in a common context. Currently, SPARK supports  equality- and subset-based analyses, variations in field sensitivity, respect for  declared types, variations in call graph construction, off-line simplification; and  several points-to set propagation algorithms. A substantial study of factors affecting precision and  efficiency of points-to analyses has been performed as a demonstration of SPARK in  action. The results show that SPARK is not only flexible and modular, but also very  efficient compared to other points-to analysis implementations. Two client analyses that use the points-to information are  described, call graph construction and side-effect analysis. The side-effect  information can be encoded in Java class file attributes, so that, it can later be  used for optimization by other compilers and virtual machines. SPARK has been demonstrated to be a flexible and efficient  framework for Java points-to analysis. Several experiments that could be performed  with it are suggested.</description><creator>Lhot√°k, OndrÃÜej</creator><contributor>Hendren, Laurie (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Spark : a flexible points-to analysis framework for Java</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3f462611b.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sx61dm961</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6d56zx12k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:35Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) feeding scars on  trees were used as an index of past porcupine abundance in the Bas St. Laurent  region of eastern Quebec, Canada. The frequency distribution of scars revealed that  porcupine populations have fluctuated regularly over the past 130 years in the Bas  St. Laurent region, with superimposed periodicities of 11 and 22 years. This  porcupine population cycle has closely followed the 11 and 22-year solar activity  cycles. An analysis of local temperature and precipitation data revealed a close  relationship between fluctuations in annual precipitation and both the solar cycle  and the porcupine cycle. These results suggest that the solar cycle has sufficiently  important effects on the climate along the southern shore of the St. Lawrence  estuary to influence terrestrial ecosystem functioning to the point of setting the  rhythm of porcupine population fluctuations. This is the strongest available  evidence of a top-down cascading effect of solar variability on ecological systems  at the decadal time scale and local spatial scale. These results confirm and extend  those obtained by others at greater temporal and spatial scales and provide exciting  opportunities for future research on the extensively debated topic of solar  variability and its impact on our planet.</description><creator>Klvana, Ilya</creator><contributor>Berteaux, Dominique (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>North American porcupine -- Climatic factors -- Qu√©bec (Province) -- Bas-Saint-Laurent.</subject><subject>Rodent populations -- Qu√©bec (Province) -- Bas-Saint-Laurent.</subject><subject>Climatic changes -- Qu√©bec (Province) -- Bas-Saint-Laurent.</subject><subject>Solar cycle.</subject><title>The solar cycle as a possible modulator of ecosystem functioning on the decadal time scale : new evidence from North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) feeding scars and climatic data</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rb68xc445.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6d56zx12k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qb98mg10p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:36Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Chemokines, small molecular weight chemotactic cytokines, are  produced mostly by airway epithelial cells and are known to play an instrumental  role in the recruitment of inflammatory cells. Studies have documented a dramatic  increase in the chemokine levels in the airways of asthmatics and many other studies  have shown the induction of these chemokines by cytokines and growth factors in  airway epithelial cells in vitro. Thus, given the high levels of chemokines in  asthmatic airways and abundant evidence supporting strong interactions between  cytokines and epithelial cells, we hypothesized that chemokine receptors are present  on airway epithelium, and that chemokines may act through these receptors to  increase mucin production. Here we demonstrate constitutive expression of chemokine  receptors CCR3, CCR5 and CXCR4 in the A549 cell line by Western blot and  RT-PCR. The results of this study show that chemokine receptors are  present on airway epithelial cells and that chemokines may act as a stimulus for  epithelial cell mucin gene expression. Our novel finding that several CC chemokines  upregulate the expression of MUC5AC mRNA might be an important mechanism regulating  airway epithelial cell phenotype and function under conditions of inflammation in  asthma.</description><creator>Kontolemos, Mario</creator><contributor>Hamid, Qutayba (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</subject><title>Chemokine receptors on airway epithelial cells and their potential role in regulating mucin production</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rf246.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qb98mg10p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pathology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1j92g8169</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:36Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In the expanding computer science field of Graph Drawing,  methods are developed to draw graphs in order to fulfill certain criteria, including  minimizing the number of edges that need to be removed to make a drawing planar.

CASK, a multimodular MAGUK containing CamK, PDZ, SH3 and GK  domains, is involved in a variety of molecular events including EGF receptor  localization and signalling, KIF-17 dependent NMDA receptor containing vesicle  transport, presynaptic vesicle exocytosis and basolateral localization of certain  transmembrane proteins. CASK also translocates to the nucleus upon interaction with  the Tbr-1 transcription factor where it functions as a transcription regulator. We  used the CASK PDZ domain in a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify novel members  involved in CASK function. TRIP, a TGF-beta Receptor II  (TBRII) Interacting Protein that modulates  TBRII-dependent gene expression, was identified as a CASK binding protein through  its consensus C-terminal PDZ type-II interacting motif.

The work shows that the system dynamics approach is appropriate to  integrate the different components considered in the TAP conceptual framework  elaborated in this work. The conceptual framework illustrates the different system  components found important in the literature, portfolio decision-making, learning,  information gathering, uncertainties and economics perceptions and their involved  relationships. The model is first calibrated and validated using the case of  soybeans adoption versus corn uses in Quebec from 1987 to 1998. Validation is  performed through five tests, namely visual, statistical and sensitivity, modularity  and extendibility are performed to show the relevancy of the  approach. The model is then applied to the case of four input  biotechnology crops. Again three types of validation tests are carried out. Results  show that the model predicted the shape of the curve for all application fields.</description><creator>H√©bert, Yann</creator><contributor>Baker, L. B.
