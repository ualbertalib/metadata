Organized around five semantic qualifiers, this analysis explores a number of Lessing's works belonging to several literary categories for evidence of the appearance of the daring, self-aware, public, engaged, and vocal individual. It argues that Lessing, as a humanist, is committed to individual personal actualization but that this is tempered with her personnally held views about what is valuable and enriching human experience. It concludes that as author of fictional tales, autobiographical texts as well as political essays, she designs the path of self-development she considers worthy of mention.</description><creator>Laviolette, Carole.</creator><contributor>Szanto, George (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Individuality in literature.</subject><subject>Lessing, Doris May, 1919- -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><title>The tyranny of coherence /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gx41mk89x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w37639001</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Graduate Communications Program</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7d278w25v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:06:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This Master's thesis proposes to examine the place of space in five works by Andre Breton which are: Nadja (1928); Les Vases communicants (1932); L'Amour fou (1937); Arcane 17 (1945); Martinique charmeuse de serpents (1948).

The conclusions of this study are the following: religions has, in Diderot's opinion, more negative than positive effects; myths and superstitions prevent the search for truth; fatalism cannot be accepted as a valid philosophic theory; traditional morals and its concept of virtue go against human nature and produce moral "idiotisms"; judicial system creates crimes where nature did not; "anti-natural" morals requires humans to adopt utopic ideal attitudes the effect of which is to mentally unbalance them and lead them to debauchery; the morals prescribed by idealism leads to social hypocrisy; human cannot keep irrevocable promises dictated by institutionalised idealism. Diderot, therefore, favours a new ethic based on real human behavior.</description><creator>Kingsbury, Fanny.</creator><contributor>Tichoux, Alain (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Diderot, Denis, 1713-1784 -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><title>La critique de l'idéalisme dans les romans et les contes de Diderot /</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wm117q84z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nz806188s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:r494vm953</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:06:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In a multicultural society educators face the problem of identifying and promoting values that help people to interact in a peaceful and just manner. Instead of imposing values through indoctrination educators can promote multicultural values by designing and enacting curricula that help children to self-generate and choose these values. I have developed a curriculum that uses international folktales to promote multicultural values without imposing them. This thesis is a holistic rendering of theory and practice in respect to the curriculum developed. The theory emphasizes multiculturalism and folktales as children's literature with a brief discussion of values education, qualitative research, anthropology, and curriculum design. The research comprises the procedures, results, and conclusions of a pilot study exploring children's value responses to international folktales and a principal study of teaching the curriculum to a sixth grade class. Through the synthesis of theory and practice a better understanding of multiculturalism emerges along with a researched curriculum.</description><creator>Keys, Timothy J.</creator><contributor>Smith, David (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Multicultural education.</subject><subject>Tales -- Study and teaching (Elementary).</subject><title>Resolving the paradox of a multicultural society : the use of international folktales for the promotion of multicultural values in the classroom</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128ng67f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r494vm953</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Culture and Values in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:s1784n700</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:06:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The concerns of the artist-figure are a central issue in the work of Leonard Cohen. His novels, poems, and songs, seen as a whole, form a portrait-of-the-artist. Cohen's artist-story is crafted with attention to the romantic tradition of the Kunstlerroman but extends beyond an initial apprenticeship phase, the focus of the Kunstlerroman, offering a more extensive exploration of the artistic vocation. The artist-figure, as he develops, encounters conflicts between his vocation and the demands of the outside world. Cohen's artist-figure endeavours both to make art and to self-create, and this creative impulse is simultaneously propelled and hindered by the romantic-love relationship, by the demands of an artist's role in the public sphere, by the aesthetic requirements of art itself, and by spiritual and religious issues. The last of these four concerns provides the artist-figure with a degree of lasting comfort through its mediation of some of the ongoing internal struggles of the artistic temperament. Cohen's portrait-of-the-artist attains a degree of depth and perspective by his own artistic persona's intrusion into his work, a persona he constructs in an ironic, self-conscious, and self-reflexive fashion.</description><creator>Hill, Colin, 1970-</creator><contributor>Trehearne, Brian (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Artists in literature.</subject><subject>Cohen, Leonard, 1934- -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><title>Leonard Cohen's lives in art : the story of the artist in his novels, poems, and songs</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p5547t475.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s1784n700</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:47429c293</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:06:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The goal of this thesis is to shed light upon a particular style of writing, namely the rhetoric of the extreme, which characterizes the oeuvre of Anne Hebert. Many facets of this rhetoric are reflected in her work: the use of words referring explicitly to the notion of the extreme ("toujours", "jamais", etc.); formation of isotopies (extreme wealth or extreme poverty); dualistic themes; ethical polarisation; the elaboration of strongly contrasting characters (Bernard and Heloise in the novel Heloise); and the use of the trope which unifies two extremes: the oxymoron. Rhetoric, in the modern sense of the word (following the work of the Groupe Mu, Gerard Genette and Roland Barthes) enables, on the one hand, a lexical analysis of the vocabulary of the extreme (such as "toujours", "rien", "pas un", etc.), and on the other, through the character analysis of Elisabeth Rolland, heroine of Kamouraska, renders the repeated use of the oxymoron meaningful. Finally, the adoption of a holistic viewpoint highlights an evolution in her style. Given the possible juxtapositions inherent in a Manichean universe (opposition in her earliest and latest works, union in her three novels from the 1970s), two different worldviews are revealed which correspond, for the author, to two stylistic modes.</description><creator>Hamel, Sébastien.</creator><contributor>Boucher, Jean-Pierre (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Hébert, Anne -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><subject>Hébert, Anne -- Literary style.</subject><title>La rhétorique de l'extrême chez Anne Hébert /</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rj4306679.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/47429c293</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gb19f7979</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:06:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The present study examined 1st, 3rd, and 5th graders' ability to hear two simultaneous melodies. Two familiar ("Frere Jacques" and "The Barney song") and one unfamiliar melody were used as the stimuli. The pairs of simultaneous melodies were presented in different registers and timbre combinations. The children were asked to press specially labeled keys on a computer keyboard to indicate which song(s) they heard. Responses were recorded by a computer. The older children identified two simultaneous melodies faster (df = 2, F = 12.803, p $&lt;$.01) and more accurately (df = 2, F = 13.098, p $&lt;$.01) than the younger ones. While 70% of the 1st graders reported hearing two melodies and identified them with 75% accuracy, over 95% of the 5th graders reported hearing two melodies and identified them with 97% accuracy. Children who were able to correctly identify two simultaneous melodies did not tend to identify the melody in the upper or the lower register in any particular order when the timbre was the same in both registers. When the melodies were played with contrasting timbres (trumpet and piano) they tended to identify the trumpet melody before they identified the piano melody. However, in terms of response-speed they identified the upper melody faster than the lower melody. Children who were only able to identify one melody tended to focus on the upper melody when the timbre was the same in both registers but when the melodies were played with contrasting timbres they would attend to the trumpet melody regardless of register.</description><creator>Gudmundsdottir, Helga Rut.</creator><contributor>Costa-Giomi, Eugenia (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Musical ability -- Testing.</subject><subject>Musical perception.</subject><title>Children's ability to identify two simultaneous melodies</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1g05fd80b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gb19f7979</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xs55md85m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:06:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation is a recension of the thesis of Harry J.

What economic, social, political and symbolic resources are involved in the production of gay space? And how can social space be thought of as creating the conditions of possibility for the formation of specific gay identities and communities? Using a "production of space" analysis adapted from the work of Henri Lefebvre, I examine the case of Montreal's gay village. I argue that the emergence of this space, in both material and symbolic terms, has led to a particular sense of "spatial identity" among many gay men in Montreal. I analyze the implications of these "space-based" identities for queer community formation and conclude that the Village constitutes a compromise with the dominant culture, rather than a radical form of spatial praxis.</description><creator>Doyle, Vincent André.</creator><contributor>Straw, William (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Gays -- Identity.</subject><subject>Gay communities -- Québec (Province) -- Montreal.</subject><title>Coming into site : identity, community and the production of gay space in Montréal</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3t945s80s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rv042v98x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Graduate Communications Program</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gx41mk90p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:06:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>French literary translators have traditionally translated in an ethnocentric fashion in such a way that the translated work did not seem translated. They tried to write their translations in the same way the author would have, had he been French. Readers of French translations seemed quite satisfied with that approach. Yet there are translators who do not feel comfortable with this ethnocentric approach. They have done a great deal of reflection on their work, and are introducing new ways of translating literature. One of these is Antoine Berman. We have dedicated the first half of our work to his theories and the second half to a possible application of these theories to a novel by Joyce Carol Oates, I Lock my Door upon Myself. This novel was translated in France by Marie-Lise Marliere and its French title is Un amour noir. We will quote examples from the translation where we feel we can apply Berman's theory of "distorting tendencies" and make practical suggestions of alternative French translations. Our conclusion leads us to explore ways to better serve the French readers of Joyce Carol Oates.</description><creator>Dionne, Micheline.</creator><contributor>Chapdelaine, Annick (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Translating and interpreting.</subject><subject>Oates, Joyce Carol, 1938- I lock my door upon myself.</subject><title>Etude traductologique d'une traduction française de J.C.

For Innu of Sheshatshit, Labrador, community healing involves much more than mending physical aliments. Healing signifies a move towards new social meaning and coherence and is a forum for negotiating Innu identity. This thesis attempts to redress this gap in the literature by describing the deeply nuanced meanings community healing takes on in community discourse and its implications for contemporary Innu identity. Additionally, this account explores the significance of nostalgia for the past and of country space in community discourse as it relates to community healing.</description><creator>Degnen, Cathrine.</creator><contributor>Corin, Ellen (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Healing -- Newfoundland and Labrador -- Sheshatsheits</subject><subject>Naskapi Indians -- Mental health</subject><subject>Community health services -- Newfoundland and Labrador -- Sheshatsheits</subject><title>Healing Sheshatshit : Innu identity and community healing</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kw52j988x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m326m3822</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anthropology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hd76s211s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:06:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Any agreement, treaty or commercial transaction needs to be governed in order to work. The New Economics of Organisation literature glosses over the fact that different parts of the same transaction may be governed in different ways. In contrast, this thesis argues for the existence of "hybrid transacting" and presents two international bargaining cases to illustrate how interstate agreements are entered into legally, but enforced extra-legally. Given that the enforcement of international agreements is extra-legal, this thesis presents two lines of argument that are designed to answer the question, why do states enter into their agreements with other states in a legal way? It is suggested that treaty law offers states two important advantages. First, treaty law is a solution to an "information ordering" problem. Second, it is suggested that treaty law operates as a baseline against which reputation can be assessed.</description><creator>Davies, John, 1972-</creator><contributor>Haskel, Barbara (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Interstate agreements.</subject><subject>Commercial law.</subject><title>Extra-legal and legal governance of international transactions</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m039k713m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hd76s211s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nc580p52x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:06:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The idealist philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte's concept of state and nation was derived from the intellectual well-spring of his philosophical system, the Wissenschaftslehre. Fichte's intellectual evolution reflected the contemporary tumult of European civilization. Fichte's basis for an interest in social and political organisms was an irrepressible belief in the individual's 'striving' toward the ultimate human goal of an absolute moral freedom. Influenced by Kant and Rousseau, Fichte developed a unique vision of the state and society. Fichte drew upon aspects of his theological concepts, educational theories and life-experiences to produce a holistic approach to individual self-formation (Bildung). The role of the state in controlling the mechanisms for individual Bildung changed considerably over his career. Despite a renewed interest in Fichte's philosophy, English-language scholarship has largely neglected his contributions to German political thought. This thesis traces the development of Fichte's social and political thought through his philosophical, educational and political writings.</description><creator>Crombie, Bradshaw.</creator><contributor>Hoffmann, P.

Parents of participants and coaches from three clubs in each of three different geographic regions were asked to fill out questionnaires. Respondents were asked to rate the degree to which they felt clubs were meeting participants' needs in four categories of objectives. The categories were: Participation, Program, Instruction and Development. Comparisons were made between groups of respondents and geographic regions. An analysis of variance was done on the data in each of the four categories. While the percentage of returns from both parents and coaches was discouraging, it was found that, in general, both instructors and parents are satisfied with what their clubs are providing. In all categories of objectives the ratings obtained were high. The analysis showed a significant difference between parents and coaches in the Participation category as well as between geographic regions for the Instruction category. It was found that coaches have a more favorable opinion than do parents of their clubs' abilities to meet Participation needs. It was also determined that respondents from the urban area had more positive attitudes toward their clubs' abilities to meet participants' Instruction needs than did those from the rural region.</description><creator>Cooke, Amy M.</creator><contributor>Neil, Graham (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Athletic clubs -- Québec (Province)</subject><subject>Gymnastics for women -- Study and teaching -- Québec (Province)</subject><title>An assessment of girls' artistic gymnastics in clubs of Quebec /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2j62s681g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8w32r7546</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physical Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9019s438c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:06:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A quantitative research synthesis (meta-analysis) was conducted to determine the effects of exercise on health-related physical fitness of people with an intellectual disability. While studies on this topic have been qualitatively reviewed (e.g., Fernhall, 1993; Fernhall, Tymeson, &amp; Webster, 1988; Pitetti, Rimmeri &amp; Fernhall, 1993), the effects of exercise on some of the health-related physical fitness components remains unclear, or unknown. Further, none of the reviews determined the influence of study characteristics on study outcomes. The data were 24 studies yielding 104 effect sizes based on 826 subjects. These analyses revealed that the outcomes of the studies related to cardiovascular endurance and muscular endurance were influenced by the variables of document source and length of program. More specifically, published studies produced significantly larger mean effect size than unpublished studies, and longer programs ($ ge$9 weeks) produced significantly larger mean effect size than shorter programs (58 weeks). Further it was found that the level of exercise frequency, influenced flexibility. More specifically, programs with higher exercise frequency ($&gt;$3 times per week) produced significantly larger mean effect size than programs with lower exercise frequency (3 times per week).

As cultural theory, simulation offers insights into the stabilization and propagation of cultural forms. Used descriptively, the metaphor of simulation throws into definition a cultural pattern of progressive formalization through increasingly sophisticated methods of abstraction. I find evidence of the pattern at many levels of analysis; metaphysical, social and micro-social, particularly at the level of the body. I use the speculative notion of the digital refiguring of culture to articulate this tendency towards abstraction through a parallel with the enhanced analytic and representational capacities of digital technology. I consider several actual and hypothetical ways that the computer figures in this process. I argue that the basis for cultural form is shifting away from the referential function of the body, as the abstract realm of mediated relations takes on greater importance in modern culture.</description><creator>Cecil, Malcolm Kirk.</creator><contributor>Levin, Charles (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Computer simulation -- Social aspects.</subject><subject>Culture -- Philosophy.</subject><subject>Virtual reality -- Social aspects.</subject><title>Simulation and the digital refiguring of culture</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s4655j597.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8623j092s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Graduate Communications Program</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qj72p914g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:06:34Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study examined the effectiveness of an adaptation of Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT) in increasing the communicative speech of young children with Down syndrome. Eight children were matched according to their mean length of utterance and divided into two groups, the melodic group and the spoken group. The same individual treatment was received by all during twelve weekly sessions, except for the manner in which target phrases were presented: spoken versus melodically intoned. Data was collected from language samples taken before and after treatment as well as from audiotapes of the children's verbal responses produced during the weekly sessions. Findings revealed greater gains for the melodic group than for the spoken group for total verbal output, length of response and production time, thereby providing evidence for the positive effect of MIT. Implications for future research were addressed and applications for implementing MIT with young children were discussed.</description><creator>Carroll, Debbie.</creator><contributor>Stubley, Eleanor (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Music therapy.</subject><subject>Down syndrome.</subject><title>A study of the effectiveness of an adaptation of melodic intonation therapy in increasing the communicative speech of young children with Down syndrome /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5425kc686.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qj72p914g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nv935497h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:06:34Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis investigates the economic and military policies hegemons pursue while experiencing relative decline. Based upon the rising costs of leadership associated with hegemony, this thesis establishes that both systemic and domestic environments equally influence the hegemon's policy-making. Furthermore, the paper contends that hegemons do practice strategic planning during relative decline, in an effort to adjust its commitments and resources to the environment. Relative success or failure in maintaining the international system and thus adjusting for decline depends on how decision-makers compensate for two prevailing variables: threat of challengers and availability of allies. This study offers a predictive theoretical model for interpreting the dynamics of grand strategy formulation, compensating for the influences of the domestic environment three historical case studies, the Dutch Republic, Britain and the United States, test the accuracy and validity of the model. This thesis finds that periods of strong leadership, void of threat, while augmented by external balancing best support a hegemon's relative decline.</description><creator>Breton, Steven Daniel.</creator><contributor>Brawley, Mark R.

The literature review focuses on knowledge-building within the main development theories and paradigms, two mainstream approaches to building knowledge about HRD and education sectors in developing countries, namely the systems approach and the strategic approach, and the role of the researcher and expert-sources of data in the knowledge-building process in research related to HRD and educational policy. The methodology involved carrying out a case study on HRD in Nicaragua using a conceptual framework, and then studying its role in the process of learning about the subject. The data for the study of the learning process were generated through self-reflection in journal writing, textual analysis of the HRD case study, and common-sense. The conclusions are that (1) a researcher cannot know with certainty about the quality of his or her knowledge of the subject in conducting this type of research, (2) a conceptual framework can absorb the complexity of the process and make a researcher sound more authoritative than he or she might actually be about the subject, (3) researchers tend not to deal adequately with this lack of certainty and complexity in their discussions on the limitations of their work, (4) the sources of data directly affect the quality of learning, (5) a conceptual framework brings greater efficiency to the research act, (6) a conceptual framework reduces distortion and allows better communication between the research and the human sources of data, and (7) a conceptual framework adds greater value to the process of managing the research act than it does to learning about the subject.</description><creator>Bracegirdle, Peter.</creator><contributor>Lusthaus, Charles (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Education -- Nicaragua.</subject><subject>Manpower policy -- Nicaragua.</subject><title>The utility of a pre-developed conceptual framework for learning about national human resources development needs : the case of Nicaragua</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3n2041154.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/70795964g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3j333435c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:06:36Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Basil Hall Chamberlain and Lafcadio Hearn were two of the best known western interpreters of Meiji Japan. In their correspondence as well as published writings, they commented on the conclusion of the Aoki-Kimberley treaty of 1894 and the subsequent end of the "unequal treaties" and the treaty port system in Japan. Chamberlain, a resident in Tokyo for over two decades, was most concerned with the fate of foreigners in Japan who would be adversely affected by the end of extraterritoriality and the favourable commercial privileges which they had enjoyed since 1858. He was critical of the jingoism of the nationalistic reaction which developed during the course of treaty negotiations. Hearn, in contrast, praised this national or "racial" spirit and credited it with Japan's success at the negotiation table. Partial to ideas of racial difference and conflict, Hearn viewed the new treaty as evidence of the resurgence of an oriental race against the forces of western imperialism.</description><creator>Bowers, Romy Joanna.</creator><contributor>Ota, Yuzo (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Japan -- Foreign relations -- Great Britain.</subject><subject>Hearn, Lafcadio, 1850-1904.</subject><subject>Great Britain -- Foreign relations -- Japan.</subject><subject>Chamberlain, Basil Hall, 1850-1935.</subject><title>B.H.

It aims at demonstrating that Verne's writing and the topics favored therein constitute an account of the opinions prevailing during the second half of the XIX$ sp{ rm th}$ century. Following an examination of the changes brought by scientific discoveries and their technical applications in French society, as well as of the fears arising from the speedy material progress, it picks out the images that allow the author of the Voyages extraordinaires and the creator of the "scientific novel" to translate and transform the expressions of progress of the period. Finally, the thesis aims to nuance this enthusiastic portrait, and stresses the fact that warnings and ambivalences towards technical progress are not absent from a work that prefers to instruments giving access to progress a moral spirit guiding them.</description><creator>Bonnin, Agnès.</creator><contributor>Amgenot, Marc (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Verne, Jules, 1828-1905 -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><subject>Progress in literature.</subject><title>L'écriture du progrès ches Jules Verne : ambivalences de la modernité</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v979v498z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nv935498s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pc289k95c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:06:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The objective of this thesis is to isolate the symbolism of ornaments and armaments in the epics and in the rituals of Kannaki and Draupadi A detailed comparison of ornaments and armaments in the Cilappatikaram and in the Mahabharata will be provided, as well as an analysis of the function and meaning of these objects in the ritual traditions of Kannaki and Draupadi A study of the epic and ritual significance of ornaments and armaments will not only contribute tn the understanding of the nature and the role of these symbols, but should also shed light on the interaction between the Tamilian and Sanskritic goddess traditions.

Foremost among them was the near-total absence of Italian female literary role models. Female writers often expressed ambivalence towards the writing of other women, which was considered inferior to male writing. However, their reverence for male writers revealed how conflictive their identities as writers were, and it was an impediment to the establishment of a serious women's literary tradition. In addition to such personal conflicts, these writers also faced the challenge of gaining acceptance by the male-dominated literary community and by their readers. These two groups expected that women's writing conform to a moral code which did not apply to men's writing. This thesis is an analysis of the specific problems that female novelist Bruno Sperani and others faced as they strove to establish themselves in Italian literature.</description><creator>Balletti-Thomas, Joanne.</creator><contributor>Kroha, Lucienne (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Sperani, Bruno -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><subject>Italian literature -- Women authors -- History and criticism.</subject><subject>Women authors, Italian -- 19th century.</subject><title>Women's writing and the "anxiety of authorship" in nineteenth-century Italy : Bruno Sperani and others</title><language>ita</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sb397b212.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qj72p915r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Italian</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7w62fb35b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:06:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This qualitative study explores how older adults, who are retired or contemplating retirement, make choices regarding their non-formal educational experiences. This national study collected data from 154 Elderhostel participants, aged 42 to 85 and, consistent with Moustaka's five phases of phenomenological analysis, triangulated the data from 17 focus groups, 10 in-depth interviews, and a demographic questionnaire. The choice of Elderhostel as an educational venue for learning, and the specific course selection, were found to be influenced by 14 factors: location, travel, program, course content, accommodations, cost, dates, negotiation with travel partner, social, sites, personal requirements, escape, information, and the policies, philosophy and program requirements of Elderhostel. A participant typology emerged during the data collection and analysis and revealed six types of Elderhostelers: the activity oriented, geographical guru, experimenter, adventurer, content-committed, and the user. The study of decision-making processes in education is in its infancy. This study paves the way for the doctoral study to expand on this foundation of knowledge by quantitatively investigating the 14 factors which were identified, defined, and examined in this study.</description><creator>Arsenault, Nancy.</creator><contributor>Anderson, Gary (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Decision making.</subject><subject>Older people -- Education.</subject><subject>Elderhostels.</subject><title>Understanding older adults in education : decision-making and Elderhostel</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mc87ps54p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7w62fb35b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Administration and Policy Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):500</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
