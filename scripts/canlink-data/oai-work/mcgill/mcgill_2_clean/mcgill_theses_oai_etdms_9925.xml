This mercaptan disappeared slowly during the first 50-60 per cent of the polymerization but underwent a rapid increase in rate of disappearance thereafter. This rapid rate of disappearance at high conversion cannot be accounted for on the basis of changing styrene content during polymerization or upon mercaptan addition to the polymer double bonds. Changes in viscosity of the polymer during polymerization were studied. A decrease was observed in the same conversion range where the rate of the mercaptan disappearance increased. Tertiary hexadecyl mercaptan was applied to the preparation of relatively homogeneous polymers of different composition and molecular size. On the basis of the modifier reaction theory polymers of various compositions but of the same molecular weight were prepared and studied. It was found that the viscosity decreased and the solubility increased with an increase in the styrene content of the polymer.</description><creator>MacLean, David B.</creator><contributor>Nicholls, R.

Highly purified disulfur deoafluoride was found to have a freezing point of -54.2ºC. Dielectric measurements on the liquid and vapour using a refined Schering bridge revealed the following: Dielectric constant (liquid, 0ºC.) - 2.064; dielectric constant (vapour, 50cm.) - 1.0028; power factor (liquid 0°c.) - 0.0311; specific conductivity (A.C.,0ºc.) - 1.94 x 10^-10 mhos; molar polarization - 33.4 c.c.; atomic polarization - 12.1 c.c.; dipole moment - 0. These indicate that S2F10 is a highly stable non polar dielectric. Part II - High Pressure Instrumentation At High Temperatures. Four reliable instruments for P-V-T measurements on gases at 100 atmospheres and 1500ºc. have been developed: i - A furnace temperature controller for the range 150 to 1500ºc., accurate to 0.1ºc.; ii - A condenser depth probe for an all steel mercury compressor and a contact electronic vc circuit acting as depth indicator; iii - A capacitive mercury manometer for pressures in the range one to five atmospheres, accurate to .0005 atmospheres; iv - A differential pressure gauge and electrical indicator with sensitivity, .0l atmospheres, range, 10 atmospheres, 500% overload safety factor, and working pressure, 100 atmospheres.</description><creator>Hollies, Norman R.</creator><contributor>Maass, O.

[...] As the number of plants which were described became greater, it was apparent that some had many characteristics in common, others only a few, and it was logical then, for students of plant life to classify plants according to the physical characteristics such as could be readily recognized. [...] The botanist has found that all plants may be divided into two major groups; the members of one group (Vascular plants) have a vein system and are characterized by possessing distinguishable roots, stems and leaves; the members of the other group (Non-vascular plants) which have developed more slowly are without a vein system. [...] Those plants which possess a vein system and are termed the Vascular plants are divided into Spermatophytes or Flowering plants and Pteridophytes or ferns depending on the method of reproduction. The Spermatophytes which are the most highly developed are reproduced by seeds and the Pteridophytes, like all Non-Vascular plants, are reproduced by spores. [...] The chemist has already made some progress in determining chemical differences between the Classes of Spermatophytes, the cellulose, hemicellulose, and certain minor components have been shown to differ and it was naturally of interest to determine if general chemical differences in lignins occurred as seemed likely from earlier work.

The first section discusses the necessary differences between the theory held by the Greeks and that held by modern thinkers. This subject is divided into comparisons between the Greek and modern theories concerning the state, the individual, law, and society. The next section deals briefly with some writers prior to the fifth century who were concerned with this problem. It gives some examples of the Greek love of liberty and equality which characterises fifth century thought and is of prime importance in the conception of supreme political power. The last section gives in some detail opinions on this subject held by the main writers of the fifth century, and, if such opinions are not specifically stated, they are inferred from the general political attitude of the author. </description><creator>Levitt, Bella.</creator><contributor>Woodhead, W.

The technique can be explored in relation to the absolute criterion of international specialization or, it can be examined in relation to the relative criterion of national expediency. However, it is impossible to deal with the subject consistently if we accept the relative premise and apply the absolute criterion to it. [...] This works purports to examine (1) whether exchange control is a technique in a secular trend or, merely an emergency measure; (2) are its characteristics universal or specific to the economy in which it exists; (3) has it performed its functions adequately in recent applications, (193l-1940); (4) what are its potentialities as an institution in future world economy; and (5) what impact will it have upon Canadian economy. [...] The aim of this thesis has been to approach the study of economic conditions in contemporary Germany and the Continent from an impartial and objective standpoint. The conclusions reached in the first four chapters must be qualified by the use of secondary sources and the conglomeration of other factors which belie the success or failure of the technique itself. In the Canadian-American situation the authorities do not find it advisable to offer all the pertinent information. We have therefore been obliged to use less authoritative indices and refrain from making any vulnerable long-term generalizations.

Rabbits were used as the experimental animals. The true fat fraction was determined according to the method recently developed by Horwitt and co-workers. The standard procedure (A.O.A.C.) was used for the determination of ether extract. The true fat content of a high fat feed (soya bean) was found to be completely digestible. In grass the digestibility of true fats was lower. This was probably due to the fact that the grass cell had a higher fiber content, which hindered the complete action of the digestive enzymes upon the cell constituents.

The mean deflections were then determined from these two measures. [...]</description><creator>Davis, John Frederick.</creator><contributor>Howes, F.

The normal type has twenty-one pairs of homologous chromosomes. Those types which are being studied in this work are characterized by having either twenty pairs of homologous chromosomes and one univalent, or twenty pairs of homologous chromosomes and two heteromorphic chromosomes which may or may not pair at meiosis. The mutant wheats studied were an anomalous 41-chromosome homozygous speltoid, B and C Series heterozygous speltoids, sub-normals, sub-compactoids, and a homozygous compactoid. Plants of these different mutants may be distinguished by various characters of the head such as shape of glume and length and compactness of head. These mutants form a series of types grading from those like Triticum spelta L. (homozygous speltoids) through heterozygous speltoids to normals and through sub-normals and sub-compactoids to those which resemble Triticum compactum Host. (compactoids) The characters grade from long loose heads with square-shouldered glumes in speltoids to short compact heads with almost shoulderless glumes in compactoids. [...] Homozygous compactoids have twenty-one bivalents. They differ from the normals in that they have two Co chromosomes instead of two C chromosomes. Quite frequently these chromosomes, like the Co in sub-compactoids, pair within themselves and so appear as univalents. [...]</description><creator>Kerr, Ernest A.</creator><contributor>Huskins, C.

[...] In as much as the reactions of the simple hydrocarbons are of great importance from both the theoretical and industrial points of view, it is not surprising that keen interest has been shown in their thermal decomposition mechanisms. Unfortunately, however, the thermal decomposition reactions of these compounds generally involve complicated steps, difficult to untangle, with the result that to deduce a mechanism from the experimental data obtained is, in many cases, little better than pure speculation. Consequently present day trend, in the field of gas kinetics, is to the more simple and elementary processes and for this reason investigations with the lower members of the aliphatic hydrocarbons have been favoured. Since the available information on the reactions of the simple hydrocarbons comes from a variety of sources it is considered desirable to outline briefly, in a general way, the information that can be obtained by various independent methods. Before doing this, however, it is necessary to discuss briefly the essential features of unimolecular gas reactions generally.

Iron ore beneficiation methods are largely determined by the nature of iron ores as well as by the blast-furnace requirements. In modern blast-furnace practice the structure of the ore and the chemical composition are both of importance. Certainly, the higher the iron content and the lower the silica, phosphorus and sulphur, the more desirable the ore becomes, but if its structure is bad, that is, if the blast-furnace gases penetrate the lumps of ore with difficulty, the ore is even less satisfactory than one of poorer chemical composition but more porous structure.

Il a consacré au moins la moitié de son oeuvre à l'étude des complexités des passions de l'amour. Il est d'usage, en effet, de distinguer deux groupes d'ouvrages dans sa production. Le premier groupe est avant tout l'oeuvre d'un psychologue qui regarde dans le coeur de l'homme pour y suivre la naissance et le délevoppement des passions. L'auteur étudie l'individu et les problèmes de son âme. Les derniers romans, cependant, s'éloignent un peu des problèmes de l'individu pour sa préoccuper d'avantage de ceux de la société en général, réflétant ainsi les pensées d'un auteur plus intéressé par la sociologie que par la psychologie. Parce que l'auteur mûri se soucie avant tout du bien de la société, on parle souvent des romans de sa deuxième manière comme de l'oeuvre d'un moraliste, en laissant de côté les premiers romans. Le vrai, pourtant, c'est que le moralists s'est lentement épanoui chez l'auteur comme l'aboutissement natural de ses études sur l'individu. En tant que "physiologists de l'amour moderne," il avait déjà noté les devoirs moraux de l'individu envers le reste de la société.
