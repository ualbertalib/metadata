In this thesis, we explore the  feasibility of using a new solution to suspend the ball. First a literature review  on theoretical background and the development of magnetic levitation is presented.  This is followed by the hardware design. In the next chapter, dynamic modeling of  the maglev model, from its model identification to its linearization, is described.  Then, development of a Matlab simulation model and specification (H/W, S/W) of the  real-time digital controller are provided in detail. Experimental data is collected  and compared to the theory. We propose a proportional-derivative controller combined  to a nonlinear controller, and show that it makes the maglev system  stable.</description><creator>Liu, Jinbo, 1973-</creator><contributor>Michalska, Hannah (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Boulet, Benoit (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Design of a magnetic levitation system</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cv43nx543.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sn009z40d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ws859g27v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study investigates routing in a MPLS-based IP network with  heterogeneous holding time traffic (for example, an IP call versus an IP  conference). Our basic idea is to exploit the large differences existing in the  holding time of different types of traffic to make more efficient resource  allocation decision in the admission and routing processes. In particular, this  study investigates the concept of vacating, in which requests with short holding  times vacate the bandwidth on direct links in favor of requests with long holding  times under some traffic conditions. Based on an analytical framework we developed, we propose  several state-dependent routing schemes, namely preventive-vacating routing (PVV),  preemptive-vacating routing (PEV) and restricted-access routing (RAR). Additionally,  we deduce an approximated expression to compute the cost of accepting a long or  short request. This leads to an approximated least cost routing (A-LCR) scheme  directly. Furthermore, along with the simulation study, some of the  significant results we obtained are: (1) The effective range in traffic mix is  [0.60, 0.99], within which our vacating schemes outperform the traditional LLR+TR  (least loaded routing + Trunk Reservation) in terms of network throughput. (2)  Besides its particular flow control mechanism, the A-LCR scheme shows a constant  outperformance compared to LLR+TR. (3) The routing schemes we proposed perform  better than the differentiated shortest distance routing (Diff-SDR) scheme, which is  the only currently published dynamic routing scheme addressing the question of  heterogeneous holding times. We also study the inter-network routing issue, which focuses on  how to select the best among several gateway nodes to a foreign network. Simulation  results show that the intra-network links play a much more important role than  inter-network links when making gateway selection decision.</description><creator>He, Peng, 1970-</creator><contributor>Regnier, Jean (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>MPLS based state-dependent optimal routing in IP networks (non-homogenous case)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1j92g8151.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ws859g27v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k930bx75w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A methodical analysis of two-stage Discrete Fibre Raman  Amplifiers (DFRA) for DWDM transmission systems is presented in this thesis.  Combinations of both unclamped and gain-clamped stages are investigated. A full  numerical model was developed to simulate and fully illustrate the performance and  properties of both single-stage and two-stage DFRAs. In particular we concentrate on two configurations of two-stage  DFRAs. One that consists of two non gain-clamped stages and one that consists of one  gain-clamped followed by an unclamped stage and the inverse. The gain-clamping is  attained by placing two fibre Bragg gratings in the two sides of the stage that we  desire to gain-clamp; and thus creating a fibre laser in either the first or the  second stage of the two-stage FRA. The conclusions we draw from our simulations, are the following:  (1) a good gain-clamping effect can be achieved by partially gain-clamped  configurations in which only one stage (first or second) is truly clamped; (2) an  inherent low noise figure can also be obtained when the second stage is clamped; (3)  the selection of feedback wavelengths and feedback levels are critical for obtaining  a flat gain spectrum and low noise performance.</description><creator>Gryspolakis, Nikolaos</creator><contributor>Chen, Lawrence (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Theoretical analysis of two-stage discrete fibre Raman amplifiers</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4t64gn86w.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k930bx75w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h128nf35z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Although modern system operating speed and performance largely  benefit by the advanced technology, designing the system level test circuitry is  still a great challenge. Traditional ad-hoc or informal design practice is not  adequate, and an early well planned testing scheme is required to meet the concerns  raised by the increasing size and complexity of the system. Moreover, many high  speed communication issues, including BER testing, jitter measurement and jitter  injection, also need to be considered due to the increasing need for newly developed  high speed interconnect architectures such as PCI Express, Fibre Channel and  InfiniBand. In this thesis, a disciplined test interface design methodology based on  the layered model is presented in order to ease the test circuitry design by  maximizing the flexibility and reusability. Instead of setting up a completely new  test access channel, test circuitry is integrated into each functional layer of the  system to reuse the existing communication mechanisms. InfiniBand and Sensor  Networks are used to demonstrate the proposed design methodology and a new BER  testing scheme is also discussed.</description><creator>Chiang, Man Wah, 1976-</creator><contributor>Zeljko, Zilic (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>System-level test interface considerations for high speed interconnect</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/th83kz99g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h128nf35z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4j03d031q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>One of the main objectives of the next generation of mobile  communications is to provide cost-effective transmission of broadband multimedia  services over time-varying, frequency-selective fading, band-limited wireless  channels. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) with dynamic resource  allocation is one of the potential techniques to improve the system spectral  efficiency. In this work, efficient dynamic resource allocation algorithms are  developed for downlink OFDM mobile cellular systems to support multimedia traffic.  User channel responses are considered in the dynamic resource allocation to reduce  interference and hence, to increase the system spectral efficiency while maintaining  different Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements.

The present work looks at Murtaḍa  Mutahhari's (1920--1980) thought on these subjects. Ta'lim (education) and tarbiyah (upbringing) in his view are the  only paths to human perfection. The humanity of insan (human), which is based on  human knowledge and tendencies, makes him capable of receiving ta'lim and tarbiyah  and thus of becoming a perfect human being. Mutahhari believes that Islamic ta'lim  and tarbiyah are the best means of attaining such a goal. In his analysis of ta'lim, Mutahhari identifies ta'aqqul  (reflection) as the factor that enables the insan to distinguish reasonable from  unreasonable and true from false, empowers him to see the future and not imprison  himself in the present and prevents him from surrendering to the customs and  traditions of the majority. Tarbiyah, on the other hand, tends to develop the human  faculties (as compared to the animal faculties) in such a way that all his faculties  achieve their expected growth and a balanced development. In Mutahhari's view the moral foundation of each school of  thought shapes its respective system of tarbiyah by developing the human faculties  in accordance with those foundations. Hence, since the foundation of Islamic  morality is self-respect, Islamic tarbiyah can therefore be defined as a system that  develops the human faculties based on self-respect. Interestingly enough, since  self-respect is based on self-knowledge, and since this leads to the knowledge of  God, Islamic tarbiyah can therefore be said to be based on self-knowledge and  knowledge of God.</description><creator>Zolghadr, Khadijeh</creator><contributor>Ormsby, Eric (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2004</date><subject>Muṭahharī, Murtaz̤á</subject><subject>Islamic education</subject><title>The concept of ta'līm and tarbiyah in Mutahharī's thought /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bg257f77q.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wm117p50x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Islamic Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hh63sw49c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>As the twentieth century ended with globalization and  commercialization, popular culture begins to challenge the dominance of national  culture. The Chinese intellectual community tries to defend national culture against  the incoming global culture and local cultures. The conflicts between localism and  nationalism, and also between globalism and nationalism, are clearly demonstrated in  the Hero phenomenon, which basically concerns the unanimous disparagement on  director Zhang Yimou's debut martial arts film Hero within the Chinese critics'  circle. Through a discursive analysis of the phenomenon, we can see how the  conflicts between modernism and postmodernism, between elitism and commercialism  shape the landscape of contemporary Chinese culture. In this article, I first seek  to understand how modernism evolved into nationalism in China during the last  century and what role the intelligentsia played in the process of such evolvement. I  further seek to understand why the intellectual community has distaste for popular  culture and commercialism. Other research on this topic has linked nationalism to  national culture, and localism and globalism to popular culture.</description><creator>Zha, Yu, 1970-</creator><contributor>Straw, Will (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2004</date><subject>China -- Intellectual life -- 1976-</subject><subject>Motion pictures -- China</subject><subject>Martial arts films -- China</subject><subject>Zhang, Yimou -- Appreciation</subject><title>The mythology of Hero : a study of Chinese national cinema</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dn39x198h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hh63sw49c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9k41zf12b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Though an industrialized nation characterized by increasing  secularization and liberalization, the Republic of Ireland has a long history of  religious and morally-driven politics. Much of Ireland's economic success of the  last ten years has been noted as a significant motivator for social change. However,  a shift in the Irish moral sphere has been underway for at least thirty years.  Despite a flourishing self confidence in National identity, already marginalized  women---including drug-users, asylum-seekers from sub-Saharan Africa, and those in  economically deprived communities of Greater Dublin---have felt increased social  polarization. The cultural and epidemiological boundaries created between the  'healthy' Irish self and the 'dangerous' others have contributed to a unique climate  regarding HIV/AIDS and cultural constructions of 'risk'. This anthropological  analysis utilizes both political-economic and social constructionist frameworks so  that both structural and discursive contributions to the spread of HIV/AIDS are  examined. Particularly important are the ways competing discourses shape both  practices and conceptions of HIV and the 'other'.</description><creator>Powell, Sarah J.</creator><contributor>Lock, Margaret (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>HIV-positive women -- Health risk assessment -- Ireland -- Dublin.</subject><title>The construction of risk and the 'othering' of HIV positive women in Dublin, Ireland /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7h149q498.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9k41zf12b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anthropology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8049g5699</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>One can see many poems in the five books of Francois Rabelais.  These pieces in verse are sometimes inspired by the "Grands  Rhetoriqueurs", or by poets of the like of Clement Marot or Mellin de  Saint-Gelais, contemporary to the author. Rabelais reverses and parodies the forms  he imitates; likewise these very codified poetic forms are often particularly  well-suited to parody. In this case, analyzing the co-text proves to be essential  when judging parodies that are often ambiguous and more ludic than they are  satirical. Moreover, the poetry encases itself into the work, which in turn follows  models of comedy and parody: the comic-epic and the Menippean  satire. Far from being a whim on the part of the author, or a mere nod  in the direction of his friends who were poets, Rabelaisian poetry surprises the  reader by its variety, which provides a fascinating portrait of the vitality of the  poetical debates of the period.</description><creator>Pemeja, Paul</creator><contributor>Desrosiers-Bonin, Diane (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Rabelais, François, ca. 1490-1553? -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><title>La poésie dans l'œuvre de François Rabelais /</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nz806035j.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8049g5699</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:tq57nr580</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>For the creative writing part of my Master's Thesis, I adapted  two short stories into short films. My first screenplay is a free reverie based on  Mavis Gallant's "Wedding Ring", a highly blurred and elliptic story. I  then chose to work on "Careful", a text by Raymond Carver. Carver's  writing is very concise and detail oriented. In itself, it is already almost  cinematographic. The external gestures, the outside world express the character's  interiority and existential uneasiness. This kind of writing calls for a different  approach to adaptation. One that is, in the case of my personal work, much closer to  the original text. My creative writing enterprise raises a certain number of  questions regarding the essence of the adaptation process. How should one consider a  text when adapting it? Should one stay close to the original, or choose to move away  from it, at the risk of betrayal? To what extent can one impose one's own vision,  voice, words upon somebody else's work? My critical essay will explore the  particular position of the person adapting original texts for  cinema. I will focus more specifically on the case of French author,  Eric Rohmer, who rewrote some of his own literary work for cinema Unsatisfied with  the written form of his Six Contes moraux short stories, Rohmer felt the need to  adapt them to the screen. In the preface to his collection of stories, published in  1974, Rohmer speaks of his relationship to literature and cinema. He thus sets the  ground for a vast reflection on the different creative possibilities offered by  these mediums. The critical section of my Master's thesis will explore what is at  stake in this process of rewriting the Six contes moraux from the literary to the  cinematographic form.</description><creator>Kandelman, Séverine</creator><contributor>Rivard, Y.

Sabri was a leading scholar and politically active figure  of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in the Ottoman State, and was  appointed seyhulislams four times in the final years of the State. Due to his  resistance to the Committee of Union and Progress and Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, he  lived half of his life in exile in various countries, and died in  Egypt. The merit of Sabri's thought lies in its full reflection of  influential theological and philosophical currents in the nineteenth and early  twentieth centuries, and in its recognition of the crucial importance of ontological  and epistemological problems for contemporary Islam. Sabri emphasized that the  epistemic structure of Islamic thought had collapsed, meaning that the first task of  the Muslim psyche would have to consist in learning how to conceptualize and to  formulate systematically its own positions on what "being" is (ontology)  and what "knowledge" is (epistemology) in terms intelligible to  others.</description><creator>Karabela, Mehmet Kadri</creator><contributor>Ormsby, Eric (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Ṣabrī, Muṣṭafá, d. 1954</subject><subject>Shaykh al-Islām -- Turkey</subject><title>One of the last Ottoman şeyhülislâms, Mustafa Sabri Efendi (1869-1954) : his life, works and intellectual contributions</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gf06g3342.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zw12z591f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Islamic Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:c821gk46t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This is a study of the foreign and domestic policies of the USSR  as they pertain to its war-readiness, as well as the degree to which these policies  presumably opened the door to the European conflagration and, in 1941, to the  Nazi-Soviet war. Topics to be discussed include: (1) the crash industrialization of  the Soviet Union and industrial war preparations from 1928--41; (2) the development  of Soviet military doctrine before and after 12 June 1937; (3) a critical  re-examination of the popularly accepted reasons for the devolution of the Soviet  armed forces; and (4) Soviet foreign policy from 1937--41. The chronological end of  the paper (1941) is followed by a brief epilogue discussing the evident success of  the Soviet industrialization program by reference to Soviet industrial performance  during the Nazi-Soviet war. Furthermore, the epilogue will challenge the popular  depiction of the German invasion as an effortless, seamless advance into the Soviet  heartland.</description><creator>Foisy, Cory A.</creator><contributor>Boss, Valentin (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Soviet Union -- Military policy</subject><subject>Soviet Union -- Armed Forces -- History -- 20th century</subject><subject>Soviet Union -- Foreign relations -- Germany</subject><subject>Soviet Union -- Economic conditions -- 1917-1945</subject><subject>Germany -- Foreign relations -- Soviet Union</subject><subject>Soviet Union -- Economic policy</subject><title>Soviet war-readiness and the road to war : 1937-41</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pr76f4099.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c821gk46t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gt54kn74v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The global coffee industry is in a state of crisis. Small-scale  producers are those most seriously impacted by the crisis, facing the challenges of  a precarious and changing market, despite limited resources. In Oaxaca, Mexico, a  prominent response among indigenous small-scale farmers has been to join independent  coffee producer unions. Within theses unions there is currently a move to encourage  organic coffee cultivation among campesinos, so that these groups might niche market  their coffee. This niche, or "conscience", market is shaped by the  "organic coffee discourse" which emphasizes the themes of environmental  protection, social justice and indigenity. By examining the relationship between  organic coffee production (as an economic strategy for marginal producers) and its  discourse (which mobilizes consumers in wealthy countries) we will see the impetus  behind organic coffee production as it ranges from Oaxaca's indigenous farmers,  their producer unions, and consumers.</description><creator>Freeman, Julia</creator><contributor>Galaty, John (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Anti-globalization movement -- Mexico -- Oaxaca de Juárez.</subject><subject>Organic farming -- Mexico -- Oaxaca de Juárez</subject><subject>Coffee growers -- Mexico -- Oaxaca de Juárez.</subject><title>Troubled grounds : small-scale organic coffee production in Oaxaca, Mexico</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sb397891b.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gt54kn74v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anthropology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g732d962g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of the current study was to investigate factors  affecting the job satisfaction of Canadian male university basketball coaches, as it  pertained to their goals and measures of success for themselves, their athletes, and  their team. Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with six university  coaches. Three higher-order categories emerged: (a) personal variables, which  encompassed the philosophies the participants developed based on their athletic and  coaching experiences, (b) internal elements, which involved what the coaches did for  their athletes' academic, athletic, and personal development and the coaches'  personal development, and (c) external influences, which included tangible and  measurable positive and negative factors that affected the level of satisfaction  derived from the other higher order categories. These results provide a clearer  understanding of factors that affect coaches' job satisfaction, as well as the goals  that coaches set and how they measure success. In addition, this information may be  incorporated into coach training programs.</description><creator>Davies, Matthew John</creator><contributor>Bloom, Gordon A.

Women then use the imagery  and associated proverbs behind cloth names to send non-verbal messages they would  otherwise be unable to express publicly. The purpose of this study is twofold:  first, to investigate wax-dyed cloth names including their underlying meanings and  uses given by women in Cote d'Ivoire and Togo; and second, to investigate how these  names are acquired in French by women who have no formal education. Qualitative  results revealed that women in these two countries are very motivated to learn cloth  names. New undocumented names and their underlying meanings were also found. Some of  these meanings were found to be educational; others are used to maintain status or  to clarify power relationships. At the same time, quantitative results indicated  that knowledge and use of cloth names in both communities studied is in  decline.</description><creator>Davis, Glenda</creator><contributor>Winer, Lise (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Proverbs, African -- Africa, West</subject><subject>Africa, West -- Languages</subject><subject>Resist-dyed textiles -- Africa, West -- Terminology</subject><subject>Textile fabrics -- Africa, West -- Terminology</subject><title>A sociolinguistic inquiry into wax-dyed cloth names in Togo and Côte d'Ivoire /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9z9030558.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/47429972z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Second Language Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fx719n026</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Soren Kierkegaard's final Attack upon Christendom marks the  common culmination of three of the most important themes evident in his earlier,  pseudonymous books, namely the 'Leap', the 'Offence' and 'Indirect Communication.'  Modern critical scholarship tends to take one of two approaches. Either Attack is  dismissed as a deviation from Kierkegaard's previous writing, or Attack is read  without sufficient regard for its dependence upon what has come before. Both  approaches make an aberration out of the final work. This thesis proposes that  reading Attack in light of its proper relation to the pseudonymous writings offers a  more complete picture of the dialectical shape and development of Kierkegaard's  thought. Employing Plato's analogy of the Cave in Republic as a hermeneutical tool,  the thesis proposes an analogous 'ascent' in the pseudonyms out of the 'cave' of  Christendom towards a vision of authentic Christianity. By the same analogy  Kierkegaard completes the trajectory under his own name by a 'descent' from his  vision back into the practical world of public engagement with his Attack. The  thesis investigates the three key themes of Kierkegaard's oeuvre as they develop  throughout the literature and are brought to fruition in Attack upon Christendom,  and devotes a chapter each to the 'Leap', the 'Offence' and 'Indirect  Communication'.</description><creator>Backhouse, Stephen Grahame</creator><contributor>Kirby, Torrance (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Kierkegaard, Søren, 1813-1855</subject><title>Completing the vision : Søren Kierkegaard's pseudonymous texts and Attack upon Christendom</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cj82k786j.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fx719n026</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Religious Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:j67314577</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The goal of this research is to show that the Scottish reformer,  John Knox, while seen by many as a political figure, was religiously motivated in  his thought, writings, and ministry. Knox saw himself as an Old Testament style  prophet who sought to blow his Master's trumpet by proclaiming an unpopular message  to the realms of both Scotland and England. Knox was deeply rooted in the Old  Testament theology of the covenant. He believed that following an idolatrous path,  most notably in the continuing practice of the Catholic Mass, meant the breaking of  the covenant with God, as with the transgression of the people of Israel in the Old  Testament. He proposed that an aristocratic resistance by the lesser magistrates  would result in deposing the idolatrous rulers and restore the realms of Scotland  and England to a genuinely covenanted relationship with God.</description><creator>Awad, Nader</creator><contributor>Kirby, Torrance (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Knox, John, ca. 1514-1572 -- Religion</subject><subject>Religion and politics -- Great Britain -- History -- 16th century.</subject><subject>Knox, John, ca. 1514-1572 -- Political and social views</subject><title>The trumpet's blast : the political theology of John Knox</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/37720d401.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j67314577</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Religious Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g445cd805</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Individuals with autism experience specific deficits in the area  of executive function. A differentiated view of executive function was recently  described by Metcalfe and Mishel, in which a distinction was made between hot,  affective components and cold more purely cognitive, non-affective components. The  "Hot/Cold" distinction of executive function was examined in a group of  children with autism in relation to a group of typically developing children matched  on verbal, pattern and Leiter mental ages. Two hot (Gamble and Delay of  Gratification) and two cold tasks (DCCS and SOP) were administered. Children with  autism successfully completed fewer trials of the SOP, irrespective of the matching  variable, and experienced more difficulty switching rules on the DCCS in relation to  typically developing children when matched on non-verbal and performance mental  ages. No differences were found on the hot executive function tasks, except for the  group matched on VMA. These findings underscore the importance of using multiple  matching groups in the study of persons with autism, and provide evidence for cold  rather than hot executive function deficits as a primary in autism.</description><creator>Russo, Natalie</creator><contributor>Burack, Jacob Ari (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Cognition in children.</subject><subject>Autism in children</subject><title>Executive function and autism : an exploration of the "HotCold" distinction</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d791sg943.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g445cd805</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3r074v78b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study examines the importance of age, education, and the  health system reforms in the mid 1990's on the utilization of five health services:  specialists' visits, family doctor visits, non-physician health professional visits,  hospital use, and home care services. The analysis focuses on the Canadians 45 and  over, and uses data from the National Population Health Survey. Results. Age per se has only a minor effect on utilization; the  relative high utilization rates observed among the aged relate to the use of  services by people with chronic conditions, whose prevalence is higher among the  aged. Education has little impact on use of services among the aged. The reforms had  only significant effect for four services. They increased utilization of non-medical  health professional consults, and increased probability of consulting a specialist.

Divided into three  parts, the verse reads as follows: "A woman should not have keli gever (man's  apparel, utensil or tool) on her; a man should not wear simlat isha (a woman's  dress, robe, mantle, tunic); anyone who does these things is an abomination to the  Lord your God." Each part of the verse has raised questions among exegetes,  like how to define its key terms simlat isha and keli gever and what is the nature  of the abomination. This thesis explores the responses to these questions through a  presentation of the Jewish exegetical history of Deut. 22:5 from biblical times to  the present. It demonstrates how the interpretations of this verse varied the  application of the biblical law derived from it and thereby affected and altered  dress codes, interactions, behhviours, and daily habits of Jewish men and women  throughout history.</description><creator>Liebman, Tobi</creator><contributor>Levy, B.

It attempts to redefine  what can be construed as "supplying" and in the process, identifies its  various sources. The study of one of these sources, the direct contribution of  France, constitutes the second part of the thesis, as seen through the example of  Pierre-Jacques Lemoyne, supplier to the colonies from 1734 to 1762. This stance  permits to go further than the better-known world of the merchants carrying the  King's goods. Suppliers to the colonies are thus revealed to be split between  adjudicataires who obtain their contracts through public procedures, and a handful  of specialized merchants, who contact or are contacted by the Navy's administration.  The selection of these merchants seem to stem from their capacity to fulfill  adequately the Navy's needs---although the influence of "cronyism" should  not be discarded.</description><creator>Dubé, Alexandre</creator><contributor>Desbarats, Catherine (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>History, Canadian.</subject><subject>Biography.</subject><subject>History, Modern.</subject><subject>History, United States.</subject><title>Pierre-Jacques Lemoyne (1709-1778) et l'aprovisionnement métropolitain des colonies françaises de l'Amérique du Nord</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fq977v50c.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jq085k748</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vt150j83c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Western Sahara has been granted the dubious distinction of  Africa's last colony. Long a victim of imperial enterprise, the territory was  annexed by Morocco in 1975 Just as Spain withdrew. Despite international protest  affirming the Saharawi people's right to a referendum of self-determination, still  the question of Western Sahara lingers, frozen in time. This paper will demonstrate  that a referendum no longer offers a way forward for three reasons: it is unlikely a  referendum will be held due to Morocco's unwillingness to cooperate; if a referendum  went forward, it is improbable that it would prove free and fair given Moroccan  attempts to undermine the process; and if a successful referendum took place, it is  unlikely the international community would be prepared to enforce Saharawi  sovereignty. As such, alternatives must be sought. An examination of possible  scenarios suggests limited autonomy, as a result of an Algero-Moroccan  rapprochement, is Western Sahara's most likely trajectory.</description><creator>Dobner, Gallit</creator><contributor>Brynen, Rex (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Referendum</subject><subject>Western Sahara -- Politics and government -- 1975-</subject><title>Referendum : a dead letter : prospects for self-determination in Western Sahara</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2801pg87z.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vt150j83c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:47429974h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The work presented in this thesis represents a contribution to  the area of modeling of the transport and fate of herbicides applied to cropped  fields, and was part of a larger research effort geared towards better management of  herbicides. The main objective of this thesis was to develop a graphical user  interface (GUI) for PESTFADE, a process-based mathematical model of pesticide  transport and degradation, and to provide documentation for the execution of  PESTFADE. The model simulates changes in pesticide concentration at different depths  in the soil, based on relevant physical, chemical, biological and meteorological  factors. PESTFADE is considered to be one of the most comprehensive models of its  kind. However, it was, until now, difficult to implement due to absence of a user  manual and graphical interface suitable for exploitation in a Windows environment.  The author developed the GUI in Visual Basic, created macros to facilitate certain  calculations, rewrote the original FORTRAN 77 code and then validated the updated  version against field data obtained from an experimental site (Eugene Whelan Farm,  Woodslea, Ontario). A preliminary development of an artificial neural network (ANN)  to perform the same simulation implicitly, with fewer input parameters and less  computational time, was also done. The thesis describes PESTFADE and the GUI, gives guidelines for  implementing the package, and presents the results of the field validation of the  revised version. During this work, the author discovered that there were problems in  the parts of the code dealing with sorption phenomena. This can be solved by  conventional kinetics or by Gamble kinetics.</description><creator>Tafazoli, Sara</creator><contributor>Prasher, Shiv O.

Literature for young readers, an ensemble of texts whose  boundaries are defined by the target readership, is a veritable small industry  which, having received a boost right after the Second World War, has not stopped  growing since 1945. Nonetheless, the practice of adapting classical works in order  to make them "accessible" for children has been current since the 19th  century. The adaptations for young readers of Rabelais's Gargantua have  been at the intersection of these two phenomena. Censorship is not practiced today  like it was at the time of this father of French letters. Nevertheless, the process  of adapting a literary work for young readers still consists of suppressing passages  in the text, modifying the narrative structure, and adding a significant paratext.  Adaptation may also simplify the language, eliminate discrepancies, transform the  narrator's point of view, etc. We have, thus, analyzed significant modifications in four  versions of Gargantua adapted for young readers, in order to identify the goals that  led to the rewriting of the text. In particular, we have turned our attention to  three of these goals: "concern for the young reader's amusement and  distraction", "concern for the young reader's education" and  "preservation of the young reader's innocence". We have found that five  means have been used in order to reach these goals: "adding a paratext",  "abridgement of the text", "purification of the language",  "simplification of the narrative voice" and "simplification of the  language".</description><creator>Boileau, Julie</creator><contributor>Desrosiers-Bonin, Diane (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Rabelais, François, ca. 1490-1553?
