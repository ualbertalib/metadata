Plants were cut at 5 different stages of maturity, and the degree of lignification determined for each stage by methods of plant histology. These individual stages were then fed to sheep and feces examined for undigested lignified elements. Lignification is initiated in the xylem, very early in the life of the plant; bundle cap cells and parenchyma tissue adjacent to the vascular strands are characteristically differentiated into elements of varying lignin content with progressive maturity. Fecal excretions on plant residues for each of the 5 cuttings proved that comminution, and henceforth digestibility of plant tissues, is directly influenced by stage of maturity and degree of lignification of the plants.</description><creator>Drapala, Walter J.</creator><contributor>Raymond, L.

Indeed, the staling of bread may well be attributed to changes in the physical nature of the starch fractions on standing. (19).

More recently, Noznick (34 has presented evidence that bread staling is associated with changes in the amylopectin fraction.

H. Holden and W. Gauvin of McGill University, is presented for verification. Heating runs are made for air flowing through a horizontal steam-jacketed commercial pipe, throughout a Reynolds number range of 6000- 15,000. The observed pressure drops are found to agree very closely with those calculated by means of the given equation. The method of evaluating pressure drop for turbulent non-isothermal runs by assuming that these runs occur isothermally at a temperature mid-way between the surface temperature and the mean bulk temperature of the fluid, first developed by McAdams for certain oils, is also tested for a number of selected runs. This method is found to be as accurate as the previous one, and to have the advantage of being less cumbersome in application.</description><creator>Epstein, Norman.</creator><contributor>Gauvin, W.

The loss, to the Japanese, of the principal source of natural rubber created an urgent need for four carbon compounds to be used in the manufacture of synthetic rubber. It was suggested at that time that if diol could be produced in substantial volume it could be used as an intermediate in the production of butadiene. The first investigation was undertaken by the Northern Regional Research Laboratories, United States Department of Agriculture, in 1942, to study the production of diol by the fermentation of corn or wheat mashes. [...] This thesis is divided in two parts. The first work reported in Part I involved certain preliminary experiments with Aerobaclllus polymyxa and Aerobacter aerogenes. An effort was made to confirm a previous report (1) that a cellulose decomposing organism, designated N4, produced diol when grown on a wheat mash. Later, a search for diol producing organisms was conducted among starch and cellulose decomposing bacteria isolated from the soil by Alarie (2). One of these was found to yield a butanol soluble substance which was determined as diol by the method of Johnson (3). In Part II, extensive work on the fermentation of carbohydrates by this organism is reported.</description><creator>Ewart, Mervyn Henry.</creator><contributor>McFarlane, W.

Results revealed that both tumor incidence and gross tumor yields were less in the thyroidectomized and 1-thyroxine treated groups, as compared to the intact controls. Furthermore, increasing the dose of 1-thyroxine in the thyroxine treated group, resulted in a reversaI of the progressive tumor growth potential with regression and complete extinction of a significant number of the established mammary tumors in this group. Histologically, tumors of the thyroidectomized and control groups were identical, while a characteristic morphologic variant was seen only in the mammary tumors of the 1-thyroxine treated group. Since the effect was not universally seen throughout the sections examined in any single tumor nodule, it is postulated that tumors are composed of heterogeneous cell populations, one of which is endocrine-dependent or sensitive to the effects of 1-thyroxine administration.</description><creator>Ong, Dionisio</creator><contributor>Shragovitch, I.

[...] Another very important requirement arising from the world-wide range of radio telecommunications is that there shall be international understanding and agreement about it. As a result of these studies international committees have discussed the topic with the idea of drafting specifications for measuring interference which can be used universally. [...] This thesis presents a study of the transient response of the radio-frequency and intermediate-frequency circuits of a National type NC-200 commercial superheterodyne communication receiver to pulse excitation. This study was made for the purpose of assisting in the design of the receiver circuits from the point of view of obtaining linear response to radio noise peaks. The results of the investigation show that linear response can be obtained with this type of receiver. Hence, this receiver, with a satisfactory indicator connected to the detector output circuit, nay be used as a Noise Meter.</description><creator>Filman, Norman John.</creator><contributor>Howes, F.

The action of this substance was studied in vivo and the histological changes induced by PRA in various organs of the rabbit were compared to those induced by a common antigen (human gamma globulin). It is suggested from the data obtained that PRA does not act as a common antigen. In the PRA treated animals the most striking changes were noted in the spleen. There were marked effects on the white pulp but the most significant histologic features were observed in the red pulp and consisted of intense proliferation of cells of the myeloid-erythroid series.

An investigation was initiated into the metabolism of glucose, a nutritional source of energy, in order to determine the cause of the energy loss. The maximal operation of the electron transport mechanism was found to be limited by the poor availability of both a hydrogen donor and cytochrome c. Mongrel dogs were subjected to hemorrhagic shock. Slices and homogenates of mucosa were incubated in the presence of radioactive glucose (C-1, C-6, or uniformly labelled). The QO2 of the slices and homogenates was found to be depressed after shock. Carbon dioxide production by the control mucosa occurred predominantly via the pentose cycle. There was only a slight increase in the activities of the pentose cycle and tricarboxylic acid cycle after shock. There was an increased lactate production after shock, not all of which could be accounted for in terms of glucose. Thus, although there are significant changes in carbohydrate metabolism, they are not as great as those seen in previous studies on ATP synthesis.</description><creator>Mavrais, Denis A.</creator><contributor>McArdle, H.

Contractions of the isolated whole bladder were recorded on a smoked drum. Decentralization produced an approximately three-fold increase in sensitivity to acetylcholine. Denervation did not change the sensitivity to acetylcholine. McN-A-343, a muscarinic agent was significantly less effective after decentralization and ineffective after denervation. Neither procedure changed the sensitivity to potassium. Atropine antagonized low but not high doses of acetylcholine. This antagonism was less marked on the decentralized than on the control bladder. The lack of supersensitivity after denervation is consistent with the "dual action" hypothesis for acetylcholine suggested by Koelle (1961). McN-A-343 seems to act indirectly in this preparation. Histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine and andrenaline had little or no effect on the bladder and could not be used to demonstrate an expected supersensitivity after denervation.</description><creator>Martorana, Piero A.</creator><contributor>Eade, N.

Gilpinia hercyniae was first discovered in America in the fall of 1930 in the Gaspe Peninsula. How long it had been active in this country has not been determined, but at that time it had already severely defoliated spruce over some 2,500 square miles in the interior of the Gaspe Peninsula. The spruce sawfiy is presumed to have been introduced at least several decades ago (6). Like many organisms introduced without their native enemies, it increased rapidly in population and by 1939 had spread eastward throughout the Maritime Provinces, westward through the Province of Quebec into eastern Ontario. By this time it was also present in the New England States, as far south as Connecticut and west as New York. In 1941 the first sample of the species was received from Newroundland( 6). The peak of the infestation was reached about 1938 when an estimated 12,000 square miles were heavily infested (9). Tallies in 1942 in the Gaspe peninsula showed about 75% by volume of the white spruce dead, and about 45% of the black (8). The decline ot the outbreak coincided with the appearance of diseased larvae. [...]</description><creator>Hawboldt, Lloyd S.</creator><contributor>DuPorte, E.

The arterial hypoxemia of general anaesthesia is associated with a fall in lung compliance and a right to left shunt-like effect. This can be reversed by periodic hyperinflation. The major part of the present studies is designed to assess whether periodic hyperinflation could favourably alter arterial hypoxemia, intrapulmonary shunting, lung morbidity and mortality, of experimental shock. Results showed no significant arterial hypoxemia or "shunting" in the two forms of experimental shock periodically hyperinflated - (i) hemorrhagic, and (ii) superior mesenteric artery clamping; morbidity and mortality were lower in the hemorrhagic shock hyperinflated than in the hemorrhagic shock not hyperinflated. Sham control groups showed pathological lesions similar to shocked groups. A minor second series of experiments assessed whether the immunologically competent white blood cells of transfused blood in shock caused a graft-versus-host reaction in the lungs. This reaction is thought to occur in prolonged cardio-pulmonary bypass procedures.

The mechanical and chemical properties of the final polymer and ease of processing have been found to be dependent on many factors other than the choice of monomers.

[...] It is the purpose of this present investigation to test the validity of the copolymerization equation using several pairs of monoolefins and diolefins, and to determine the monomer reactivity ratios for their bulk copolymerizations. Further, an attempt will be made to extend the applicability of the copolymerization equation to the emulsion copolymerization of the same pairs. In this way, it is hoped, that besides obtaining knowledge of the gross composition and fine structure of these copolymers in both systems, that more light may be thrown on the effect of various structural factors present in monoolefins and diolefins, whereby they facilitate or hinder monomer entry into copolymer chains.</description><creator>Henery-Logan, Kenneth Robert.</creator><contributor>Nicholls, R.

The dopamine-β-hydroxylase activity was decreased to as little as 20% of the controls. The activity of dopamine-β-hydroxylase was found to be correlated with the concentrations of copper in the liver and heart. An intraperitoneal injection of disulfiram caused 100% inhibition of the enzyme. The most satisfactory basal diet of several tested in this work consisted of 50% powdered milk and 50% cornstarch, with added vitamins and minerals. In a study of simultaneous deficiencies of copper+iron it was observed that the concentration of iron in the liver rose considerably in copper deficiency, and in iron deficiency the copper level rose. A study of the he art rates of copper-deficient and of control animals in response to stress showed no differences.</description><creator>Lloyd, Kenneth G.</creator><contributor>Sourkes, T.

It was found that red cells coupled to protein-dinitrophenyl conjugates by the bisdiazotized benzidine method were unsatisfactory for use in this assay. Indicator red cells could be satisfactorily prepared by a direct reaction between red cells and fluorodinitrobenzene provided that protein was included in the buffer solutions used. Various parameters of the reaction between red cells and fluorodinitrobenzene were investigated and optimum reaction conditions were established. The specificity of the assay was shown by the inhibitory effect of free Ɛ-DNP-L-lysine. The induction of hemolysin production by RNA extracted from immune tissue was repeated as in the literature.

The experiments directed attention to the ducts ability to resist toxic substances, such as those that may be present in a diseased pancreatico-biliary system. Experiments were conducted on eighty nine healthy cats, which were standardised nutritionally. The experiments showed that these so-called toxic agents, under the conditions reported in this thesis, caused no permanent ill-effect, but that incubated infected bile proved to have potent mucolytic and cytotoxic effect. AIso, it became clear that mechanical factors, such as quantity of infusate, pressure, etc. were able to alter the results and it is possible that this variation may effect already reported experimental findings. Finally, it was concluded that a low grade infection in the biliary tree can in a patho physiological system, initiate pancreatic inflammatory disease.</description><creator>Konok, George P.</creator><contributor>Thompson, A.

Others (147, 148, 149) have worked on the catalytic hydrogenation of pyrogallol and gallic acid (XLV) and have successfully isolated some of the stereoisomers of the cyclohexane analogs of these aromatic compounds. the object of the present work is to study the chemical reduction of gallic acid (XLV) and trimethyl gallic acid (XLVI) by means of sodium and isoamyl alcohol. Complex polyhydric phenols are more or less readily available from the lignin portion of hard or soft wood or from bark. In Canada, where large quantities of lignin and bark are available as waste products from the forest industries, the production of useful chemicals from these materials might become of considerable economic importance. The study of the chemistry of the simpler polyhydric phenols might, therefore, open up important ways in which lignin and bark could be utilized.[...] It was one of the aims of this research, to determine under what conditions the reduction of the benzene ring of trimethyl gallic acid, (XLVI), could be accomplished while keeping hydrogenolysis of the bond between the ring carbon and the ether (or hydroxyl) oxygen at a minimum.</description><creator>Spivak, John Denon.</creator><contributor>Purves, C.

The results obtained indicate that there is no significant difference between the mean plasma levels of estrone and estradiol in the two groups. The plasma estriol, however, is considerably higher in the breast cancer patients. This elevated estriol suggests an increased activity in estrogen metabolism. An attempt was made to determine the site of this increased activity in three patients with breast cancer by measuring the estrogen level in the peripheral plasma and in mammary vein plasma obtained during mastectomy. Comparison of the values obtained for each patient suggests that the mammary tumor is not the site of increased metabolic activity. When the mean plasma estrogen levels of breast cancer patients were compared to those found in patients with metastatic cancer (Table X1), no significant difference was found between the two groups. The foregoing work indicates that it is not justifiable to conclude that the metabolic disorder of estrogens noted in patients with breast cancer is peculiar to this specific disease until sufficient knowledge exists regarding estrogen metabolism in other diseases.</description><creator>Kalomiris, Constantinos</creator><contributor>Browne, J.

Subjects exercised upright on a bicycle ergometer. HR was measured by ECG chest electrodes, Qc by the N20 method, V02 by collection of mixed expired air and V by a dry gas meter. Results were; 1. work capacity increased by 10% or more in the hockeyists, but maximal HR, Qc, V02 and V were not increased, 2. these parameters were remarkably constant among all athlete groups in the trained state, except that skiers had a higher V02 which may be a prerequisite for excellence at this sport rather than a training effect. Findings at submaximal work loads provided an explanation for the increased work capacity following seasonal training. Thus, a decreased HR, Qc and V at any given submaximal work load characterized the trained state. Since work after training causes less stress on cardio-respiratory function than it did before training, a higher maximal work capacity is possible with no increase in maximal cardiorespiratory dimensions.</description><creator>Douglas, Frederick G.</creator><contributor>Milic-Emili, J.

The methods proposed for this study had previously been perfected on various other derivatives of cellulose, starch and sugars (1, 2, 3, 4). These methods depended on the fact that the p-toluene sulfonyl (tosyl) esters of primary, as opposed to secondary, alcohols gave quantitative yields of alkyl iodide when treated with sodium iodide in a ketone solvent. However, it was considered advisable first to apply the same techniques to simpler compounds which possessed a structural similarity to the hydroxyethyl ethers of cellulose.

Lipoprotein metabolism in the rat was studied by use of labelled precursors in the form of palmitate and leucine. Lipid of the very low density lipoprotein turned over at a faster rate than that of the other lipoprotein fractions. The protein moiety was found to be removed from the plasma at a rate comparable to that of lipid. Studies with puromycin treated and hepatectomised rats demonstrated the dependence of lipid release upon continuous protein synthesis at the site of lipoprotein formation in the liver. These results are discussed in relation to the current carrier theory of lipid transport.</description><creator>Delahunty, Thomas J.</creator><contributor>Rubinstein, D.

For example, catechol and guaiacol have been obtained by zinc dust distillation (1), protocatechuic and veratric acids by alkali fusion (2, 3, 4) and vanillin and syringaldehyde by nitrobenzene oxidation (5, 6) of lignins. Accordingly, pyrogallol and, later, vanillin were chosen as simple analogs of the phenolic substances which are normally bleached. Since hypoiodite is a milder oxidizing and halogenating agent than hypochlorite, it was felt that a preliminary investigation of the action of alkaline iodine on these phenols would be more likely to yield positive results, which might be correlated later with those obtained in parallel experiments using chlorine. Extensive rate studies have revealed that the action of these hypohalites on pyrogallol and vanillin is greatly dependent on the hydroxyl ion concentration of the system and can be divided in all cases into two phases, an initial “fast”, followed by a “slow” reaction. A number of products have been isolated from these reactions at various pH levels, and some light was thrown on the nature of the reactions, whether one of oxidation or of halogenation, in the particular cases studied.</description><creator>Thorn, George Denis.</creator><contributor>Purves, C.
