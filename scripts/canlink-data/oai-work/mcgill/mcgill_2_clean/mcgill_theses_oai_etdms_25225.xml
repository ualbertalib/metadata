Two structural myelin proteins, PMP22, a  polytopic myelin protein, and P0, an Ig-like transmembrane protein, play a major  role in myelin formation. A large number of mutations have been identified in P0 and  PMP22 genes. Neuropathies associated with PMP22 and P0 mutations have varying  severities suggesting their effects are pleiotropic. It is of great importance to  explore molecular pathogenesis of mutated P0 and PMP22 proteins in order to  understand the basic process of myelination and its pathology. We hypothesize that  these mutations have a variety of effects on the cell biological processes,  including activation of ER quality control mechanisms, abnormal intracellular  trafficking, or disruption of normal function. In order to dissect these possible  effects, we studied the intracellular distribution and trafficking of mutated forms  of PMP22 and P0 proteins in mammalian cells. Our studies indicate that the various  P0 and PMP22 mutants may exert their pathogenic effects in different compartments  and by different mechanisms in the mammalian cell.</description><creator>Shames, Igor</creator><contributor>Richardson, J.

Antidepressant drug  action and acceleration strategies are discussed with respect to the serotonergic  drugs citalopram and pindolol, and subsequently the rationale and methods for the  current thesis experiments are derived. A summary of the experimental observations  will demonstrate that acute citalopram treatments can suppress serotonin synthesis  through serotonergic somatodendritic autoreceptors and, moreover, this effect may be  antagonized by co-treatment with pindolol. Finally, the correlation and significance  of these results are discussed with respect to the neurobiology of depression and  the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying antidepressant action of  citalopram.</description><creator>Nguyen, Khanh Q.</creator><contributor>Diksic, M.

APNA monomers, where the  nucleobase can be thymine, cytosine adenine or guanine, with backbones contain  thiophene and pyridine moieties were synthesized. Suitably protected APNA-APNA and  PNA-APNA dimers were also synthesized as building blocks for the solid phase  synthesis of APNA-PNA chimeras and APNA homopolymers. Due to the instability of the  pyridine-containing APNA oligomers to the harsh acidic conditions required to cleave  oligomers from the MBHA resin, a new protocol was developed for the synthesis of  these molecules on the trityl chloride resin. Oligomers of PNA and APNA-PNA chimeras  were successfully synthesized on this solid support, and cleaved from the resin  using mild acidic conditions.</description><creator>Myers, Eddie Leonard</creator><contributor>Tsantrizos, Youla S.

In the group of predators, Neoperla  (Plecoptera) was numerically dominant and gut content identifications were used to  determine food chain and life cycle stages. Neoperla diet analysis indicated the  Chironomidae (Diptera) as the dominant prey with predation upon Trichoptera and  Ephemeroptera influenced by the life cycle stage of the predator. Gut content totals  were analysed for predatory diet changes due to heavy metal contamination exposure.  The Neoperla community indicated a prey shift from a Chironomidae based diet to one  including a higher percentage of Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera earlier in the  predators life history when compared with upstream control sites. Neoperla diets  maintained their shift from the control station diets as the downstream movement of  heavy metal contaminated water mixed and dissipated within the study  area.</description><creator>MacIntosh, John, 1967-</creator><contributor>Lewis, D.

The methodology consists in applying graph theory to the  intersection graph of censored data. The maximal cliques of this graph and their  real representations contain all the information needed to find NPML estimates  (NPMLE). In this thesis, a new algorithm to determine the maximal cliques of an MICD  set is introduced. The concepts of diameter and semi-diameter of the polytope formed  by all NPMLEs are introduced and simulation to investigate the properties of the  non-uniqueness polytope of the CDF NPMLEs for bivariate censored data is described.  Also, an a priori bounding technique for the total mass attributed to a set of  maximal cliques by a self-consistent estimate of the CDF (including the NPMLE) is  presented.</description><creator>Liu, Xuecheng, 1963-</creator><contributor>Vandal, Alain C.

First, a process-based  mathematical model, DRAINMOD-P, was developed by combining the attractive features  of DRAINMOD and PESTFADE. While DRAINMOD formed the main component to perform  hydrological predictions, PESTFADE's pesticide sub-model was used to simulate  pesticide fate. The new model was validated against three years of independently  collected field data from southern Ontario. Several statistical parameters were  calculated to evaluate model performance. Second, an implicit model, Multivariate Adaptive Regression  Splines, MARS, which is also a novel data mining tool, was used to assess pesticide  transport. MARS was first validated against the field data on three herbicides,  namely, atrazine, metribuzin and metolachlor. DRAINMOD-P and MARS simulations,  though impressive, need further validations before they can be recommended for  actual real-world use.* *This dissertation is a compound document (contains both a paper  copy and a CD as part of the dissertation).

Histological  examination of the testis and epididymis of PPCA-/- mice from 2--10 months of age  revealed cell- and region-specific abnormalities compared to their wild type  counterparts. The testis showed a significant decrease in the diameter of  seminiferous tubules, a significant increase in the size and number of interstitial  space macrophages that became filled with pale lysosomes, and Leydig cells that  showed an accumulation of pale lysosomes. The epithelial cells of the caput and  corpus regions of the epididymis were highly vacuolated, containing numerous pale  lysosomes, with some cells appearing to undergo degeneration. Halo cells of the  entire epididymal epithelium were also highly engorged with pale lysosomes, and in  the intertubular space large vacuolated macrophages were prominent. Taken together,  the adverse effects on the testis and epididymis suggest that sperm in the lumen may  be reduced in numbers and not acquire their full maturational state, accounting for  reduced pregnancies noted in PPCA-/- mice.</description><creator>Korah, Nadine</creator><contributor>Hermo, Louis (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><subject>Biology, Anatomy.</subject><title>Structural abnormalities in the testis and epididymis of cathepsin A deficient mice</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w0892b478.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m613mz152</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6t053g69w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:14:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Intra-abdominal infections are a common entity faced by general  surgeons, which, when complicated by pneumonia lead to increased mortality. The  susceptibility to a second infection is correlated with impaired polymorphonuclear  neutrophil (PMN) migration to the remote site, perhaps due to inadequate PMN number.  We tested the second front hypothesis that the elevated mortality arising from a  second infection is due to insufficient circulating PMN, the majority being  sequestered at the first site of infection. Further, augmentation of systemic PMN  number by granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) will decrease  mortality. We established a murine model for peritonitis and pneumonia. PMN  counts in the blood, lung tissue, peritoneal cavity and bronchoalveolar system were  measured. The results indicated significant PMN recruitment to the primary site of  infection, whether lung or abdomen. Almost no PMN were found in the lung if it was  the second site of infection. This was consistent with the second front hypothesis.</description><creator>Huang, Felicia, 1970-</creator><contributor>Christou, N. V.

The recovery of administrated methionine as urinary total S over 48 hours  was 106% in well-nourished piglets, but only 69% in protein malnourished piglets.  The N/S balance ratio of protein malnourished piglets was lower than that of  well-nourished piglets, and this ratio further decreased after methionine  administration. We conclude that in a protein malnourished state, relatively more S  than N is retained and a significant portion of the S derived from administrated  methionine is retained in non-protein pools. These results demonstrate that urinary  total S excretion can provide an accurate measure of SAA catabolism; and the N/S  balance ratio can provide valuable information about non-protein SAA storage in  growing piglets.</description><creator>Hou, Chunsheng, 1968-</creator><contributor>Wykes, Linda (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Sulfur amino acids -- Metabolism.</subject><subject>Piglets -- Metabolism.</subject><title>Sulfur amino acid catabolism in a piglet model</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z603qz074.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v979v3702</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p5547s06q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:14:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A high electric field RFQ device was developed and tested to  investigate the design requirements needed for such a device to effectively cool and  confine ions in gaseous environments. Segmented cylindrical quadrants placed 1mm  apart were used to create axially confining fields similar to present trapping  systems. High Q air-cored resonating coils were designed to drive the RFQ device at  4.76 MHz and place up to 5.4 kV between adjacent electrodes in vacuum. By removing  the transformer cores from the resonating circuit and using a 1 kW RF amplifier it  was found that up to 15 kV of RF potential could be achieved across adjacent  quadrants at helium pressures of up to 80 Pa. The main limiting factor associated to the device's function was  found to be the power losses in the transformer coupling the resonant circuit to the  RF amplifier.

We next investigated whether the presence of the  pups at the time of exposure to stress could modify the magnitude of the hormonal  response to a male intruder in the home cage or to a predator odor (fox urine) in a  novel environment. In the male intruder paradigm, levels of CRF mRNA expression in  the PVN and CeA were lower in LL compared to EL or V females and plasma ACTH and B  secretion was also reduced in LL compared to EL females. In EL females, the presence  of the pups with their mothers at the time of stress significantly increased plasma  ACTH and B responses to either male intruder or predator odor compared to EL females  without their pups for 2.5hrs or 48 hrs. These studies point out to the critical  role of the pups in modulating the maternal response to stressors that represent a  threat for the litter.</description><creator>Deschamps, Sophie</creator><contributor>Walker, Claire-Dominique (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Psychology, Physiological.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Mental Health.</subject><title>Infant modulates stress responsiveness in lactating female rats</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2v23vv015.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hq37vp205</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zw12z5930</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:14:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>eIF4F is a complex of three polypeptides: eIF4E, the cap binding  protein, eIF4A, an RNA helicase and eIF4G, a large polypeptide which serves as a  molecular bridge between the mRNA and the ribosome. eIF4E is the least abundant of  the initiation factors in most cell types making it a crucial target for  translational control. Two important mechanisms involved in regulating eIF4E  activity are its phosphorylation at serine 209 and the binding of the inhibitory 4E  binding proteins (4EBPs). eIF4E becomes phosphorylated in response to extracellular  stimuli such as growth factors, mitogens and hormones by the p38-MAP kinase pathway  kinases Mnk1 and 2. Since the molecular consequences of this phosphorylation are not  currently understood, a project to generate a knock-in mouse with a serine 209 to  alanine mutation was initiated. This mutation is not expected to be lethal as an  equivalent fly model was recently generated and shown to be viable though the  mutants were smaller and slower developing than control flies. It is of great  interest to see if the same effects on growth will be seen with the mouse model or  if other tissue specific effects will be observed. The 4EBPs bind eIF4E and prevent the binding of eIF4G and the  subsequent assembly of the eIF4F complex. Without 4EBP1, eIF4E should be more  available to bind to the cap and initiate translation of specific mRNAs. Polysomal  RNA from MEFs prepared from these mice was subjected to gene chip analysis in order  to identify those mRNAs that are differentially translated in cells lacking 4EBP1.  The ability of the MEFs to differentiate into adipocytes was also investigated. Our  investigations and future work with the MEFs will shed light on the role of eIF4E  and 4EBP in the regulation of protein synthesis and also aid in understanding the  affects on adipose tissue and metabolism observed in the knockout mice.

To date, very little has been reported about the biochemical changes  that occur in yeast as a function of individual cell aging. To investigate this  further, six generations of a brewing yeast strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NCYC  1239) were separated according to cellular age using continuous phased culturing and  biotin-streptavidin magnetic cell sorting. To obtain cells with no bud scars (virgin cells), a concentrated  yeast slurry was layered onto sucrose density gradients and centrifuged. The  uppermost band from the gradients was collected and cells were biotinylated with  biotinamidocaproate- N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, that covalently binds to lysine  residues on the yeast cell wall. For continuous phased culturing, biotinylated cells  were added to a carbon-limited nutrient medium and growth was synchronized using the  doubling time of the cells. Harvested cells were incubated with streptavidin  superparamagnetic beads and sorted with a strong permanent magnet. In total,  approximately 75% of the biotinylated cells were recovered. Viability testing was  conducted using vital staining and plate counts, with &gt;98% viability reported  with the vital stain and 37% viability with the agar plates. In conclusion, continuous phased culture, together with magnetic  cell sorting has the potential to become a powerful tool for the study of  age-related biochemical changes in yeast. Further studies will focus on ensuring the  reproducibility of the method and using the recovered cells to study biochemical  changes occurring during yeasts' replicative lifespan.</description><creator>Butler, Barbara L.</creator><contributor>Smith, J.

The disruption of iron homeostasis and iron's  excessive deposition in AD brain tissues has received increased attention due to the  metal's capacity to promote the production of harmful free radicals. Several studies  have recently examined whether DNA mutations involved in the iron overload disorder,  hemochromatosis, pose an increased risk of acquiring AD. However, the small sample  size and low generalizability of previous studies have warranted further  investigation. We genotyped 213 AD patients, 106 Mild Cognitively Impaired (MCI)  individuals, and 63 Normal Elderly Control (NEC) subjects for the H63D and C282Y HFE  mutations to examine whether a relationship exists between HFE gene status and AD  presentation in our patient population. DNA analysis was conducted by polymerase  chain reaction (PCR) followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). We  did not find any statistically significant associations between HFE gene status and  the clinical, demographic, or neuropsychological aspects of AD in our patient  population. Interesting trends that fell short of statistical significance included:  (a) a deleterious effect of HFE mutations on motor performance, (b) an influence of  H63D homozygosity on an earlier onset of cognitive decline, and (c) an influence of  H63D homozygosity on an accelerated progression from MCI to AD.</description><creator>Berlin, Daniel</creator><contributor>Schipper, Hyman M.

Development and  optimization of this recombinant expression system were done using the green  fluorescent protein (GFP) gene cloned into expression vectors (pRK310 and pCM110) as  model systems. Selection of efficient GFP-expressing clones, long-term production  stability without selection in flasks, effects of selection, oxygen and methanol  supplies, were studied during fed-batch fermentations in a 20-l bioreactor.  Sequential batch-culture cultivations in shake flasks showed that specific GFP  production was constant in the presence of tetracycline. However, the GFP production  decreased in the absence of this selective pressure. In fed-batch fermentations of  recombinant M. extorquens ATCC 55366 (pMxaF-GFP), overall GFP yields (≈70  mg/g; GFP/cell dry weight) were not affected by the presence or absence of  tetracycline, nor by oxygen and methanol concentration oscillations. The cry1Aa gene  from Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki NRD-12 was cloned in pCM110 and then  transformed into M. extorquens. Heterologous expression of the cry1Aa gene in M.  extorquens AM1 and ATCC 55366 was detected by immunoblot analyses. This study  suggests that M. extorquens can be used as a valuable expression system for  intracellular recombinant protein production.</description><creator>Bélanger, Louise</creator><contributor>Driscoll, Brian T.

The routine use of  conscious sedation during EGDE has facilitated its diffusion, ensured patient and  physician satisfaction and has increased the potential risk of cardiorespiratory  morbidity. It remains unclear if all adult ambulatory patients require routine  conscious sedation prior to diagnostic EGDE, as the efficacy and safety of such a  policy has not been rigorously studied in a North American  population. Patients were randomly assigned to sedation or placebo in a  double-blind trial. So far 360 patients of the anticipated patients have been  enrolled, (182 randomized to sedation, 178 randomized to placebo). Groups were  similar for all baseline characteristics. Eighty-one percent of patients randomized  to placebo were able to complete EGDE without sedation. The major determinant of  "successful endoscopy" was the use of sedation (OR = 7.52; 95% CI:  4.61--12.26). Preliminary subgroup analysis suggested that among patients greater  than 55 yrs and with decreased pharyngeal sensitivity, there was a greater  likelihood of successful unsedated endoscopy, when compared to other subsets (45%  successful vs. 39% successful among the unstratified placebo population; 98%  power). The use of sedation does not improve technical adequacy.  However, the use of sedation in the performance of EGDE is the strongest predictor  of a successful endoscopy, patient self-reported satisfaction and willingness to  repeat the procedure.</description><creator>Abraham, Neena S.</creator><contributor>Collett, J.

It established a certain uniform set of  regulations in the field of international carriage by air. This widely accepted  Convention was later amended and supplemented by several instruments in order to  adjust and adapt this uniform set of rules to the rapid growth of aviation industry.  With the absence of consolidation, the result was total confusion created by the  coexistence of multiple legal regimes of the Warsaw System. To modernize and  consolidate the instruments of the Warsaw System into one single instrument, the  Montreal Convention was adopted on May 28, 1999. The first two chapters of this thesis explore the Warsaw System  and the Montreal Convention. The merits and demerits of the instruments are  discussed as well as the future of the Montreal Convention 1999. In the last chapter, the related legal regimes of Thailand are  introduced. A comparative study of the Thai laws and the international Conventions  are carried out, with a view to determine the advantages and disadvantages for  Thailand of becoming a party to the Conventions governing the international carriage  by air. The conclusion is a call for Thailand to ratify the Montreal  Convention 1999 which will soon come into force, as soon as  possible.</description><creator>Yodmani, Suvongse</creator><contributor>Stojak, Lucy (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Liability for aircraft accidents</subject><subject>Aeronautics, Commercial -- Law and legislation -- Thailand</subject><subject>Liability for aircraft accidents -- Thailand</subject><subject>Aeronautics, Commercial -- Law and legislation</subject><title>The Warsaw System : a case for Thailand to ratify the Montreal Convention 1999 or not</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ng451j15t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6t053g70n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5q47rp30n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:14:08Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation analyzes the process of harmonization of  intellectual property laws in Mexico within the North American context.

Guidelines according to which courts will  exercise their discretion become even more desirable where a remedy may impact on  the governance structures of the corporation. There is an extensive body of case law  under the oppression remedy, most of which tends to relegate the exercise of the  remedy to the facts of a case. However, from a study of the case law, two principles appear  with varying frequency depending on the size of the corporation. These are  principles which may be asserted under the oppression remedy. The first principle  states that the majority may not exercise its electoral rights to the prejudice of  the minority. It flows from the relationship between members of a corporation and  arises most frequently at closely held corporations. The second principle is against  abuse of fiduciary position, which entails a duty on directors and senior management  to protect the interests of all shareholders. Abuse of fiduciary position may also  involve instances where there is a breach of fiduciary duties to the corporation.  This second principle is more prevalent at widely held corporations. The remedy will  be tailored according to the principle under which liability was  found.</description><creator>Burger, Jan-Hendrik</creator><contributor>Smith, L. D.

They live in difficult situations of poverty, inappropriate  work and neglect, and thus are not able to enjoy most of their rights and basic  needs. The international framework for children's human rights law,  composed primarily of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the principles  inherent to it, can be described as based on a doctrine of integral protection, a  notion developed primarily by Central American legal scholars. At the same time,  however, most Central American states ignore their obligations to conform their  domestic legislation to these standards. This thesis is meant to provide Central American countries with  guidelines captured by a model referred to as UPPP2. Its main objective is for  States to acknowledge that the plight of street children needs to be understood;  prevented by adequate domestic legislation; and requires protection by effective  implementation and provision of justice.</description><creator>Brom, Charlotte</creator><contributor>Van Praagh, Shauna (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Children -- Legal status, laws, etc -- Central America</subject><subject>Street children -- Central America</subject><subject>Children's rights -- Central America</subject><title>The human rights of the child : the case of street children in Central America</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kk91fm101.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k930bx790</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9p290b11q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:14:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Our intended topic is a general discussion of the basic elements  of liability related to airline accidents to which fully automated cockpits have  constituted an associated contributory factor. In addition we addressed the  liability of air carriers arising from injuries or death caused to passengers  traveling on international flights. For this purpose, we reviewed the Warsaw System  and the different international instruments that constitute it. We also reviewed  principles of common law applicable to aircraft manufacturers and the "Free  Flight" as an example of the growing automation environment, which is a general  benefit to commercial aviation but also a likely contributory cause for accidents in  particular cases.

In this qualitative study, semi structured interviews were conducted with four (4)  lesbians (one experiencer, one aggressor and two community workers) and one  heterosexual shelter worker. The aim was to explore the intersections of gender,  "race"/ethnic group, and sexual orientation and their impact upon the  experience of violence. The accounts of the participants demonstrated that  converging identities and experiences of oppression, such as homophobia,  heterosexism, sexism and racism, affect the nature of same sex domestic violence and  negatively impact upon the conceptualization of the experience of violence. The  attitudes of social workers and other professionals are also identified as being a  significant barrier to the help seeking strategies of both experiencers and  aggressors.</description><creator>Vázquez-Roldán, Marjorie</creator><contributor>Brotman, Shari (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Family violence -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><subject>Abused lesbians -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><subject>Ethnicity.</subject><title>Initial exploration of the experiences of same sex domestic violence among lesbians from "ethno-racial" communities</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mw22v6063.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1z40kt45m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):25250</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
