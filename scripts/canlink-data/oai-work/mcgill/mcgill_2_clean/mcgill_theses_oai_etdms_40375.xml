These include the disposal of heat-emitting nuclear fuel wastes in saturated geological formations, extraction of energy resources such as oil and natural gas by steam injection and the recovery of geothermal energy by ground source heat exchangers. The objective of this thesis is to study the coupled thermal-hydrological-mechanical (T-H-M) response of fractured geological media by the computational implementation of mathematical models. From the generalization of Biot's classical theory of consolidation of a saturated porous elastic medium to include thermal effects, we first derived the equations governing coupled T-H-M processes in saturated geological media. In order to obtain numerical solutions for the governing equations, the finite element method was used. A finite element computer code, FRACON (FRActured media CONsolidation), was developed in order to simulate plane strain and axisymmetric problems. Eight-noded isoparametric elements were developed to represent the intact regions of the geological medium, while special joint elements were developed to simulate discrete joints. The intact regions of the geological medium was assumed to exhibit linear elasticbehaviour. The joints between intact regions were modelled by constitutive relationships which reproduced both linear elastic and nonlinear elasto-plastic responses. The elasto-plastic stress-strain relationship of the joint, was formulated by appeal to classical theories of interface plasticity. The elasto-plastic model for joint behaviour thus formulated is capable of reproducing many of the fundamental features of mechanical behaviour associated with naturally occuring joints, such as dilation under shear and strain softening due to surface asperity degradation. Furthermore, the thesis presents a physically-based hydraulic model of the joint that permits the inclusion of the effec The development of the FRACON code followed an extensive procedure of code verification via analytical solutions and intercode comparison. A unique set of benchmark problems was proposed in order to perform code verification for coupled T-H-M. The FRACON code was used to interpret certain laboratory and field experiments, including the following: (1) coupled T-H-M laboratory experiment on a block of cementitious material; (2) lab experiments on joint shear behaviour under constant normal stress and constant normal stiffness conditions; (3) coupled shear-flow laboratory experiment on a joint; (4) Field experiments of fluid injection in a horizontal fracture in a granitic rock mass. Lastly, the FRACON code was used to simulate the coupled T-H-M response of a rock mass to radiogenic heat from nuclear fuel wastes buried in the rock formation. The coupled H-M response of this rock mass to a future glaciation scenario was also simulated. It was shown that the mechanical/hydraulic regimes of the rock mass could be significantly changed by the above two factors. The importance of the consideration of T-H-M processes in the overall scheme of safety assessment of sites targeted for nuclear fuel waste repositories is supported by the findings of this thesis.</description><creator>Nguyen, Thanh Son</creator><date>1995</date><subject>Engineering, Civil.</subject><subject>Geotechnology.</subject><subject>Geology.</subject><title>Computational modelling of thermal-hydrological-mechanical processes in geological media</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vm40xt70t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vd66w166x</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3t945s75x</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:02:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Neural, humoral and mechanical factors affecting cardiac function and the peripheral vasculature were examined to assess the relative importance of peripheral vs cardiac factors in the control of cardiac output during exercise. First, I examined neural vs local regulation of humoral vasoconstrictors endothelin-1 (ET) and NPY, in anesthetized dogs, and showed that plasma ET levels, in contrast to NPY, increase in response to systemic hypotension but not carotid sinus baroreceptor activation. This did not occur with intact vagi suggesting an interaction of neural and humoral factors. In the next two studies I separated peripheral vascular and cardiac neural influences on cardiac output (CO) and right atrial pressure (Pra) responses during graded exercise by comparing cardiac denervated heart transplant patients (HT) with normally innervated subjects. The increase in Pra was higher in HT than normals but stabilized as the CO increased at peak effort. Stimulation of the heart with dobutamine in 2 patients did not increase exercise capacity, suggesting that peripheral not cardiac factors limit exercise in HT patients. The rise in central venous pressure at exercise onset was similar in both groups which demonstrates the importance of the mechanical effect of muscle contraction vs reflex changes in mobilizing blood from the peripheral vasculature at exercise onset. In the fourth study I assessed whether large changes in human body mass, induced by isolated gastric bypass surgery, would affect the heart rate (HR)/oxygen consumption (VO2) relationship during exercise. Peak absolute VO2 was significantly lower in the previously obese group vs obese and control groups despite similar normalized 24-hour energy expenditure. HR was higher in the previously obese at a given submaximal VO2 due to the higher relative VO2, suggesting a significant loss of muscle mass and supporting the idea that HR is a function of the relative VO2.

Of thirteen sites tested with intra-cerebral morphine injections, only the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and periaqueductal gray (PAG) produced a CPP, suggesting that morphine's rewarding effect is initiated by an action at these sites. The CPPs induced by intra-VTA and intra-PAG morphine may be produced by different mechanisms because animals conditioned with these two injections exhibited different patterns of behaviour during testing. Injections of a quaternary opioid antagonist into either the VTA or PAG blocked a CPP to systemic morphine, confirming that opiate-induced reward is mediated via opioid receptors in these sites. Lesions of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT$ rm sb{g}),$ ventral striatum (VS), PAG, or fornix reduced a CPP to morphine, although PAG and fornix lesioned animals displayed a CPP when tested in a drugged state. These findings suggest that PPT$ rm sb{g}$ and VS lesions reduce the rewarding effect of morphine, and that PAG and fornix lesions disrupt the ability to retrieve information about the relationship between conditioned and unconditioned stimuli.</description><creator>Olmstead, Mary C.</creator><contributor>Franklin, Keith B.

The factors which result in hyperresponsiveness are not completely understood. A possible mechanism is an imbalance between endogenous bronchoconstrictors and dilators. NO is known to relax tracheal smooth muscle by activating soluble guanylate cyclase and increasing the level of intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP). The first hypothesis tested was that the NO-cyclic GMP-relaxant pathway is involved in the regulation of airway responsiveness. Inhibition of endogenous nitric oxide by N$ sp{ omega}$-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) significantly increased airway responsiveness to inhaled methacholine in normoresponsive Lewis rats but less so in hyperresponsiveness Fisher rats. In addition, carbachol increased cyclic GMP levels in tracheal tissues from both strains; this cyclic GMP accumulation in tracheal tissues was also less in Fisher than in Lewis rats and abolished by L-NNA in both strains, indicating that it was mediated by a NO-dependent mechanism. These results suggest that endogenous NO plays a role in regulation of airway responsiveness and contributes to the strain-related difference in airway responsiveness in rats. To investigate the NO-cyclic GMP-relaxant pathway in rat airway, the effect of sodium nitroprusside (SNP, a NO donor) on airway responsiveness to a cholinergic agonist was measured in hyperresponsive Fisher rats and compared with the less responsive Lewis strain. Fisher rats were resistant to SNP as evidenced by less relaxation of carbachol contracted tracheal rings by SNP and less cyclic GMP accumulation induced by SNP in cultured airway smooth muscle cells in Fisher rats compared with Lewis rats, indicating an impaired response to SNP in Fisher airways. NO is known to be synthesized from L-arginine in a reaction catalyzed by NO synthase (NOS). Liver cytochrome P450 also catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of C=N bonds of compounds containing a -C(NH$ sb2$)NOH function, producing NO in vitro. We hypothesized that the biosynthesis of NO in airway smooth muscle cells could result from P450 enzymes acting on appropriate substrates. NO can be synthesized in a number of lung cell types. However, to date, no constitutive form of NOS activity has been found in airway smooth muscle cells. We next examined the possibility that airway smooth muscle itself might be able to synthesize NO. Formamidoxime, a compound containing the -C(NH$ sb2$)NOH function, was found to produce NO in cultured airway smooth muscle cells. As well, formamidoxime relaxed pre-contracted trachealis and cyclic GMP accumulation in airway smooth muscle cells in culture. These effects were inhibited by P450 inhibitors but not by NOS inhibitors. Thus, an L-arginine-independent pathway for production of NO was demonstrable in airway smooth muscle cells. This NO production was catalyzed by P450 but not by NOS. In conclusion, my studies have demonstrated an important role for endogenous NO production in determining the airway responsiveness of normal rats to inhaled cholinergic agonists. This mechanism contributes to strain-related differences in airway responsiveness in the rat.</description><creator>Jia, Yanlin</creator><contributor>Martin, James G.

Analysis of the in vivo expression of TNF-$ alpha$ and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) revealed that, early during infection, resistant C57BL/6 mice, which clear the infection by 4 weeks, have higher levels of TNF-$ alpha$ and iNOS mRNA in the spleen and TNF-$ alpha$ mRNA in the liver than susceptible A/J mice which succumb to the disease 10 days after initiation of infection. Moreover, resistant mice expressed high levels of IFN-$ gamma$ (a Th1 marker) and low levels of IL-4 (a Th2 marker) mRNA in the spleen, whereas susceptible A/J mice had low levels of IFN-$ gamma$ but high levels of IL-4 mRNA in the spleen early during infection. Increased levels of NO$ sb3 sp-$ were detected in serum of resistant C57BL/6 mice only at the time of peak parasitemia. Furthermore, treatment of resistant C57BL/6 mice with anti-IFN-$ gamma$ and anti-TNF-$ alpha$ monoclonal antibody demonstrated that TNF-$ alpha$, either alone or in synergy with IFN-$ gamma$, plays a major role in the up-regulation of NO production during P. chabaudi AS malaria. Moreover, treatment with the iNOS inhibitor aminoguanidine, eliminated resistance of these mice to infection with P. chabaudi AS without affecting parasitemia, suggesting that NO may not be involved in parasite killing in vivo. Taken together, these results demonstrate that a Th1-associated increase in TNF-$ alpha$ early during infection, as occurs in resistant mice, leads to the up-regulation of NO production which is crucial for survival of the host. On the other hand, our results also suggest that a Th2 response, as occurs in susceptible mice, does not result in protective levels of TNF-$ alpha$ and NO.

Energized by the success of the American Revolution and inspired by the calls for l'egalite, la liberte, la surete, and la propriete in France, the Jacobin authors contributed their narratives to the British campaigns for reform of parliament and extension of the franchise. In this dissertation, I argue that the Jacobin novel furnishes crucial insights into the development of a theory of juridical rights in the late eighteenth century. Working in the early modern traditions of contract theory, writers such as Thomas Holcroft, Mary Wollstonecraft and William Godwin embraced the concept of inalienable natural rights. In their novels, they identified the critical role property played in determining the individual's relationship to the law, and they celebrated the emergence of a new kind of citizen distinguished by economic independence, inalienable rights and political agency. But they also offered an important critique of contractarian thought. The Jacobins' narratives revealed the exclusion of certain segments of the population from participation in government formed by contract. Their analyses of the origins of political authority and the constitution of the legal subject render the Jacobin novel a critical component of the history of juridical rights.</description><creator>Johnson, Nancy E.

The results of a four-period crossover trial in 75 office workers suggest that 70% air recirculation when accompanied by an adequate intake of outdoor air can be used without causing adverse effects. A cross-sectional study of 2678 workers in 41 randomly selected office buildings from Helsinki metropolitan area provides evidence that mechanical ventilation, air conditioning, steam and evaporative humidification and air recirculation are risk indicators of studied symptoms in the existing Finnish office building stock. The results also suggest that outdoor-air ventilation rates below the optimal (15-25 L/s per person) increase the risk of the sick building syndrome symptoms with such sources of pollutants as present in mechanically ventilated office buildings. Theoretical examination reveals that the sick building syndrome is a figurative concept of everyday language, rather than a singular disease entity. A theoretical model, the Office Environment Model, is presented to explain relations between the office environment and health.</description><creator>Jaakkola, Jouni J.

In my thesis, I study factors that regulate the development of neuronal polarity and its relationship with neurotransmitter receptor expression. For my experiments, I have investigated the development of sensory neurons from neonatal rat nodose ganglia in culture. Sensory neurons have a pseudo-unipolar morphology, do not extend dendrites, and are devoid of synaptic connections on their somata. However, nodose neurons form synapses de novo in cultures, and I show that the neurons have retained the ability to extend dendrites. Extrinsic factors control dendrite extension by these neurons: the ganglionic satellite cells inhibit the growth of dendrites and induce the neurons to develop a unipolar morphology. In the absence of satellite cells, nodose neurons establish a new multipolar morphology and, in response to nerve growth factor (NGF), extend several dendrites. However, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) do not induce the neurons to extend dendrites, but promote the expression of properties typical of nodose neurons in vivo. As nodose neurons acquire a new dendrite-axonal polarity in the presence of NGF, they increase the density of functional neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on their somato-dendritic domains. To learn more about the relationship between dendrites extension and nAChR gene expression, I have examined the changes in transcript levels of nAChR subunits in neonatal rat sympathetic neurons developing in culture. I show that the developmental pattern of nAChR subunit expression in the cultured neurons follows closely that of sympathetic neurons developing in vivo, with the exception of one specific subunit $ alpha sb7$. I show that the increase in $ alpha sb3$ mRNA levels correlates well with an increase in the density of functional nAChRs on the neurons. In addition, my results suggest that these increases are regulated by mechanisms intrinsic to neonatal sympathetic neurons. On the other hand, the changes in $ alpha sb7$ gene expression, which correlate with changes in $ alpha$-bungarotoxin binding, are activity-dependent and regulated by a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase pathway. The results presented in this thesis provide insights on how neurons are influenced in their extension of dendrites and how this extension affects neurotransmitter receptor expression.</description><creator>De Koninck, Paul</creator><contributor>Carbonetto, Salvatore (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Cooper, Ellis (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Dendrites</subject><subject>Nicotinic receptors</subject><subject>Gene expression</subject><subject>Neurons -- Growth</subject><title>Factors that affect the extension of dendrites and the expression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors by rat peripheral neurons</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pg15bh04c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h128ng60h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qb98mh41w</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:02:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The motion control of mechanical systems with flexible links is investigated. Issues addressed are the modelling and simulation of such systems, the design of a feedback control scheme and its implementation on an actual system. The modelling method used is a combination of a spline-based spatial discretization technique, which allows a definition of the state-variable vector as the set of curvature values at the supporting points of the spline and their time-rates of change, and the natural orthogonal complement of the kinematic constraints that eliminates the constraint forces and moments from the mathematical model. The control algorithm consists of two parts, namely, the decoupling of nonlinear equations of motion and the filtering of non-working constraint forces. The former is achieved using the unconstrained equations of motion, expressed in terms of extended generalized coordinates with which the motion of each separate link is defined. The latter is accomplished using the fact that the constraint forces thus introduced indeed lie in the nullspace of the transpose of the NOC. This control scheme is implemented on a prototype four-bar flexible mechanism. Strain gauges are used to measure link curvature at the supporting points of the spline, while the time-rate of change of curvature is estimated with a Kalman filter. Moreover, the angle of rotation of the input link and its time-rate of change are measured and then used to infer the rest of the rigid-body motions. Results show that the proposed control scheme provides successful trajectory tracking while suppressing the vibration triggered by a doublet-type of disturbance. This disturbance is induced by the singularities of the mechanism coupled with the rapid inertia changes. While the main motivation of this study is the control of robotic manipulators with long and slender links, typically found in space applications, the results presented are applicable to the control of a much broader class of mechan</description><creator>Cho, Kyung Sang</creator><contributor>Hori, Noriyuki (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Angeles, Jorge (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Feedback control of planar mechanisms with structurally-flexible links : theory and experiments</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8w32r7503.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qb98mh41w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n009w4252</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:02:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We have qualitatively explained the experiments of McCloud and Maher (McCloud and Maher (95)) for the viscous fingering problem in which an anisotropy in the surface tension parameter was imposed by engraving a grid in one of the plates of the Hele-Shaw cell. We saw the need to approach the problem in an analytical form. Therefore we decided to extend solvability theory to incorporate the effect of anisotropy. We have introduced the anisotropy through a moving boundary condition by considering an effective anisotropic surface tension with an anisotropy entering as the simplest cosine term having the right symmetry for a square lattice. We carried out the singular perturbation appropriate for the surface tension parameter assuming the length scale introduced by the anisotropy is small in comparison with the length scale introduced by the surface tension. In this sense, the perturbation can be said to be microscopic. For the case in which the surface tension has a maximum at the finger tip, our theory provides two possible solutions: one corresponding to the solution of the isotropic case and a new solution which, below a threshold of the surface tension parameter, predicts a wider finger than the isotropic solution. Intuitively, we expect the "old" solution, namely the one that does not differ from the isotropic case, to be the selected solution for large values of the surface tension parameter and we expect the new solution to be selected for small values of the surface tension parameter. This was confirmed by dynamical simulations of the interface done by David Jasnow.

HGF/SF is a multifunctional cytokine that is expressed predominantly by mesenchymal cells and stimulates mitogenesis, motogenesis, morphogenesis of a broad spectrum of epithelial and endothelial cells in culture. To elucidate the normal physiological role for the met receptor (R) in the adult mouse, I first determined the cell-type specific expression of the met R in adult mouse tissues by in situ hybridization. I have demonstrated that the met R is generally expressed in epithelial cells of many tissues, as well as in hepatocytes. This data supports a possible role for HGF/SF and the met R in epithelial cell renewal and tissue homeostasis. I also demonstrated that met R mRNA and protein, as well as its ligand were expressed at a low level in undifferentiated P19 cells. Expression was increased as those cells were induced to differentiate into neuroectodermal derivatives following treatment with retinoic acid (RA) and into mesodermal derivatives following treatment with dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO). In cultures treated with RA and cytosine arabinoside, both met R mRNA and protein were localized specifically to non-dividing neuronal cells. Expression of the met R in undifferentiated P19 cells and differentiated derivatives supports a role of met R in the control of cell differentiation, proliferation during embryogenesis. I therefore examined the role played by met R during mouse embryogenesis using whole mount in situ hybridization. I have localized met R expression to the ventrolateral and dorsal-medial portions of the somite dermamyotome, in epithelial cells of the primitive gut and nephrogenic cords (the primitive urinary tract), in neuroepithelium of mouse embryos of 9 and 10 day gestation. Together, these data support a role for the met R in cell migration, proliferation and tubulogenesis during embryogenesis.</description><creator>Yang, Xiu-Ming</creator><contributor>Park, Morag (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Characterization of the metHGFSF receptor tyrosine kinase in cell differentiation and during mouse development</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xp68kj229.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1j92g932w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:td96k458k</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:02:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Nitrate reductase (Nar) of F. canadensis is membrane-bound. Glucose is the most effective reductant to support nitrate uptake, and methyl and benzyl viologens are good electron donors to Nar both in intact cells and in membrane fractions. Nitrate uptake depends upon nitrate reduction, and requires the presence of active Nar. Nitrate transport depends upon the transmembrane pH gradient. Oxygen reversibly inhibits nitrate uptake, and the minimal air saturation for this inhibition is about 2-4%. Oxygen inhibits denitrification at the level of nitrate transport rather than its reduction. The reduction of both nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide by F. canadensis is relatively tolerant to oxygen, and its nitrite reductase (Nir) is much more sensitive to oxygen than the other reductases. Neither copper- nor heme-type Nir DNA probes from Pseudomonas species hybridized with the total DNA of F. canadensis, indicating that F. canadensis Nir may possess unique properties. F. canadensis keeps the NO concentration very low under normal conditions. However, ionophores (carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxylphenylhydrazone (FCCP), and nigericin), high concentrations of nitrite, and low pH stimulate net NO production during reduction of nitrite. NO consumption by F. canadensis inhibited by several inhibitors. They are azide, cyanide, CCCP, FCCP, nigericin, sulfide, hydroxylamine, carbon monoxide, diethyldithiocarbamate, and Triton X-100. NO is toxic to Nor (nitric oxide reductase) only at concentrations $&gt;$67 nM. Studies on chloramphenicol inhibition of denitrification enzyme activity indicate that chloramphenicol inhibits denitrification at the levels of nitrate reduction and NO consumption in F. canadensis.</description><creator>Wu, Qitu</creator><contributor>Knowles, Roger (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Bacteria, Denitrifying.</subject><subject>Flexibacter.</subject><subject>Denitrification.</subject><title>Denitrification in Flexibacter canadensis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/73666648b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/td96k458k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0p096913k</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:02:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis addresses the role of diaphragmatic afferents in the regulation of breathing. The activation of diaphragmatic thin-fiber afferents by bradykinin, a physiological substance produced during muscle contraction, caused a stimulation and a redistribution of inspiratory motor drive, and a decrease in inspiratory time. These afferents are also involved in the regulation of airway smooth muscle tone, since tracheal tension and lung resistance decreased during electrical activation of the phrenic nerve. To mimic in vivo activation of mechanoreceptive afferents, phrenic nerve stimulation was performed during inspiration or expiration. Similar increases in inspiratory motor drive and respiratory timing occurred during inspiratory and expiratory phrenic stimulation. In addition, vagal input potentiated the stimulatory effect of inspiratory phrenic, but not tibial, nerve activation. Prolonged activation of diaphragmatic thin-fiber afferents by ischemia caused inspiratory motor drive to increase and then decrease to baseline values. These findings indicate either a depletion of neurotransmitter substance within afferent pathways, or the development of central inhibition of ventilatory drive. In summary, diaphragmatic thin-fiber afferent activity is an important modulating influence in the control of breathing.</description><creator>Wilson, Christine R.

The performance and utilization of these multi-million dollar machines can govern an entire mining operation. Despite their significance, they remain largely unexplored in terms of their potential. The thesis discusses the development of the forward and inverse kinematic models, the Newton-Euler dynamics, and the actuator dynamics for an electric mining shovel. The thesis relates to work undertaken towards the development of a mining shovel simulator, the purpose of which is to explore productivity and machine performance issues as a function of the interaction of the shovel with the ground. Both the parametric and nonparametric system identification results are presented, based on field test data collected from an operating mining shovel. Simulator results describing analytical and empirical models, as well as continuous-time controller and disturbance rejection are also presented.

The new trie structures have two distinctive features: (1) they store no pointers and require two bits per node in the worst case, and (2) they partition tries into pages and are suitable for secondary storage. We apply trie structures to indexing, storing and querying both text and spatial data on secondary storage. We are interested in practical problems such as storage compactness, I/O efficiency, and large trie construction. We use our tries to index and search arbitrary substrings of a text. For an index of 100 million keys, our trie is 10%-25% smaller than the best known method. This difference is important since the index size is crucial for trie methods. We provide methods for dynamic tries and allow texts to be changed. We also use our tries to compress and approximately search large dictionaries. Our algorithm can find strings with k mismatches in sublinear time. To our knowledge, no other published sublinear algorithm is known for this problem. Besides, we use our tries to store and query spatial data such as maps. A trie structure is proposed to permit querying and retrieving spatial data at arbitrary levels of resolution, without reading from secondary storage any more data than is needed for the specified resolution. The trie structure also compresses spatial data substantially. The performance results on map data have confirmed our expectations: the querying cost is linear in the amount of data needed and independent of the data size in practice. We give algorithms for a set of sample queries including geometrical selection, geometrical join and the nearest neighbour. We also show how to control query cost by specifying an acceptable resolution.</description><creator>Shang, Heping</creator><contributor>Merrett, T. H.

It is argued that Solidarity can be seen as a "hybrid" movement which combined "traditional" economic and syndicalist demands and "new" concerns with democratization of political life. A number of conducive factors, such as the fluidity and homogeneity of the Polish stratification system, the existence of a young, ambitious and alienated working class, concentrated in large enterprises and the perception of the social order in dichotomous terms, contributed to the emergence of an inter-class alliance of urban segments of Polish society against the political elite, which was widely perceived as being responsible for the acute economic, political and moral crisis of the late seventies. Also, the structure of Solidarity appears to contribute to its organizational and political success. It is maintained that the massive and rapid mobilization involved the activation of pre-existing informal ties among Polish workers. In this context, we also stress the importance of the charismatic leadership of Solidarity, especially that of Lech Walesa. Finally, we partly attribute the success of our movement to the failure of the weak, hesitant and internally divided political elite to contain the Solidarity movement and to respond to the crisis facing the nation.

Both synthetic and commercial 413 alloys were studied with iron concentrations in the range of 0.4-1.2 wt. % and manganese up to 0.5 wt.%. The effects of cooling rate during solidification and of melt chemistry on the morphology of iron intermetallic phases were determined. Image analysis was used to quantify the intermetallic size, volume fraction, and number, as a function of both melt chemistry and cooling rate. The total volume fraction of intermetallic compounds in these alloys was related to cooling rate by an exponential equation. The kinetics of both dissolution of intermetallics on melting, and of re-formation on cooling of the liquid were investigated by means of quenching experiments. Quantitative evaluation of intermetallic size and number revealed that the change in volume fraction of intermetallics in the liquid state is controlled by nucleation. The effect of settling time and the rate of gravity segregation of intermetallic compounds in a stagnant liquid metal were investigated. It was found that, in the absence of convection, settling obeys Stokes' law with the terminal velocity reached at very short times and very close to the melt surface. Strontium was used to modify or eliminate the iron-intermetallics. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)</description><creator>Shabestari, Saeed G.</creator><contributor>Gruzleski, J. E.

This thesis describes the neural control of fixation and saccadic gaze displacements. The superior colliculus (SC) is a mid-brain structure involved in gaze redirection executed either by the eyes alone or by combined eye and head movements. Microstimulation of the cat SC revealed a map of evoked gaze shifts, which was coextensive with the motor map encoded by the neuronal activity. The spatio-temporal characteristics of these evoked gaze shifts depended, to some extent, on stimulus parameters or active fixation. A definite role in fixation behavior for the fixation cells situated at the SC's rostral pole was revealed by showing that microstimulation of this area suppresses both electrically-evoked and natural gaze shifts. A pathway mediating this gaze shift suppression was demonstrated by physiological evidence that the SC's "fixation area" provides the major collicular input to brainstem omnipause neurons (OPNs), which inhibit the saccadic premotor elements. In the head-restrained animal, OPNs exhibit a pause in activity related to eye saccades. It was shown here that, in the head-unrestrained cat, OPNs pause not for the duration of rapid orienting eye movements, but for the entire duration of gaze shifts irrespective of the shape of the trajectory of the eye in the orbit. However, recording the OPNs during SC stimulation indicated that the pause is not directly related to the SC command, but to the movement overtly produced: either head-fixed eye saccades or head-free gaze shifts. We suggest that OPNs are controlled by two systems acting synergistically: a brainstem mechanism involved in quick phase generation and a collicular gaze saccade generator.</description><creator>Paré, Martin</creator><contributor>Guitton, Daniel (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>The neural control of fixation and saccadic gaze displacements by midbrain and brainstem structures</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8623j083t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z603r036z</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bc386m318</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:02:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Advances in cry research and understanding have been limited due to the lack of available analysis and classification methods which can adequately deal with the particulars of this simple, yet effective, communication medium. This thesis presents a new processing and classification methods for infant cry signals. First, a new method of accurately extracting the vocal fundamental frequency from cry signals is proposed. This multi-step crosscorrelation vector-based method accurately tracks rapid changes in the fundamental frequency in these utterances, is not limited to any particular range of pitch values, and allows a more detailed view of this important parameter for further analysis. The benefits of this method are not limited to infant cry vocalizations, however. This new method can be employed by any application that requires accurate and detailed pitch extraction, as well as being suitable for pitch synchronous analysis of a voiced signal. Then, a novel application of artificial neural networks is presented: the automatic classification of anger, fear, and pain cries. A comparison of five different input data sets derived from two different parametric representations, applied to four different neural network architectures is presented. From the classification rates obtained, the use of artificial neural networks would seem well suited to the classification of these types of infant cries and warrants future investigations. Some future work is outlined prior to the concluding remarks outlining the contributions of this dissertation.</description><creator>Petroni, Marco</creator><contributor>Malowany, Alfred S.

The first system describes the process of slow combustion of a randomly distributed reactant. It is studied by a phase-field model built up from first principles and describes the evolution of thermal and reactant concentration fields. Our combustion model incorporates thermal diffusion, activation and dissipation. We examine it in a manner which makes a connection between the propagation of combustion fronts, their kinetic roughening and the percolation transition. In so doing, we examine slow combustion in the context phase transitions. The second system describes propagation of reaction fronts arising in transformations obeying the Arrhenius law of chemical reactions. It too is modelled by a set of phase-field equations describing the dynamics of both thermal and concentration fields. A typical example of this transformation is the crystallization of an amorphous material. In addition to the features of our combustion model, this model also incorporated a realistic treatment of mass diffusion. Front propagation of our model is shown to undergo period doubling bifurcations as one varies the background temperature at which the system is maintained. The signature of these bifurcations is the same as those of the logistics map. We study how the bifurcation structure changes as a function mass diffusion, focusing on changes of the background temperature for which period doubling first emerges. This temperature is the most easily obtained experimentally.</description><creator>Provatas, Nikolas</creator><contributor>Grant, Martin (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Physics, Condensed Matter.</subject><title>Kinetic roughening and bifurcations in reaction-diffusion systems</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/td96k459v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2n49t3896</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q237ht71n</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:03:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Almost no work has been done on the substance of Kierkegaard's epistemology. I argue, however, that knowledge plays a much more important role in Kierkegaard's thought than has traditionally been appreciated. There are two basic types of knowledge, according to Kierkegaard: "objective knowledge" and "subjective knowledge." I argue that both types of knowledge are associated by Kierkegaard with "certainty" and may be defined as justified true mental representation (forestilling). I also argue, however, that the meaning of 'certainty,' 'justified' and 'true' is derivative of the object of knowledge. That is, I argue that Kierkegaard employs these expressions in both an objective and subjective sense and that the latter sense is not, as it has often been interpreted to be, subjectivist. Finally, I argue that an appreciation of the substance of Kierkegaard's epistemology reveals that the charges of irrationalism which have often been made against him, are without foundation.</description><creator>Piety, Marilyn Gaye</creator><contributor>Davies, David (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Knowledge, Theory of -- History -- 19th century</subject><subject>Kierkegaard, Søren, 1813-1855 -- Contributions to theory of knowledge</subject><title>Kierkegaard on knowledge</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s1784n611.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q237ht71n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Philosophy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zg64tn89k</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:03:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A new application of heat pipes is introduced. The present research deals with the development of a heat pipe for the on-line quality control of liquid aluminum silicon foundry alloys. Thermal analysis is a technique whereby a small quantity of a melt is allowed to solidify while its cooling curve is recorded. Analysis of the cooling curve with standard mathematical algorithms allows one to determine a number of useful parameters that characterize the liquid and solid states of the material. In aluminum-silicon casting alloys thermal analysis is often used to assess the grain size and degree of eutectic modification of the alloy before pouring. A novel probe has been developed for conducting thermal analysis of aluminum alloy melts. The probe, which resides in the melt, need not be withdrawn as it solidifies a small sample (i.e. button) at a predetermined cooling rate. Once the cooling curve results have been acquired, the probe can be instructed to remelt the frozen button and await instructions for analyzing a fresh sample. The operating principle of this novel device is based on heat pipe technology. In simple terms, a heat pipe consists of a condenser and an evaporator which contain a relatively small quantity of working substance fluid. As heat is absorbed by the evaporator, the liquid phase of the working substance is vaporized and subsequently condensed on the condenser walls from which heat is extracted. It has been shown that the designed probe, which is classified as a gas loaded annular thermosyphon, is completely workable in the range of conditions typically encountered in the thermal analysis of aluminum alloys. The thermal analysis results obtained with this new technique are in a good agreement with those of conventional thermal analysis. In addition, the new method is applicable to a wider range of operating conditions and is easier to use. Based on the semi-continuous nature of the new method, it does not need pre-preparation (materials, labour, pre-heating, thermocouple installation for each test, isolation of the sampling cup, etc.) to start thermal analysis. Also, from a cooling rate point of view, the system is well controllable. Moreover, it is shown that the probe is simple in construction, easy to use, and intelligent enough to provide semi-continuous thermal analysis. There are no consumable materials and moving parts. Thermal analysis results are reported for pure aluminum, hypoeutectic aluminum silicon (356) and eutectic aluminum silicon (413) casting alloys. Agreement in the results between the new and conventional systems is shown to be excellent. Finally, a heat transfer/solidification model of the heat pipe thermal analysis probe is derived and validated.</description><creator>Meratian Isfahani, Mahmood</creator><contributor>Gruzleski, John E.

For this, a time-dependent coordinate transformation is first used to obtain a fixed computational domain. The resulting governing equations in the fixed domain are discretized in real time based on a three-time-level implicit scheme. A pseudo-time integration with artificial compressibility is then used to reduce the resulting coupled discretized equations in delta form to set a decoupled scalar tridiagonal systems. The method of solution has been applied to various 3-D unsteady flows in annular geometries, as well as to 2-D annular flows. The numerical results obtained are compared with those based on a mean position analysis, without transformation, for small-amplitude oscillation. This comparison shows that the time-dependent coordinate transformation is necessary to obtain accurate solutions for larger-amplitude oscillations. The mean-position approach has also been applied to the analysis of axially variable annular configurations. The results obtained show more pressure recovery after a diffuser section with 6$ sp circ$ half-angle than in the case of 20$ sp circ$ half-angle. A comprehensive experimental study was conducted to validate the theoretical results in the range of laminar flow. The results obtained were in good agreement with the numerical results, specially with those obtained by the time-dependent coordinate transformation. Experiments were also conducted for turbulent flow. Based on the theoretical models developed, a computational method has been used to study fluid-structure interaction phenomena. It was applied to several cylindrical annular configurations in which one side of the annulus, the outer cylinder, is assumed to be flexibly supported, and thus to be susceptible to flow-induced instabilities. The structural and N-S equations were solved simultaneously by employing the numerical method developed for the unsteady flow and a fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme for the structural motion. The numerical results thus obtained have predicted the stability of the structure for different annular geometries. The structure having a uniform annular geometry was shown to be more damped, while the annular geometry with a backward facing step is less damped. The study of the structure for a uniform annular geometry in the case of the rocking motion of the outer cylinder predicts an instability in the form of flutter of the outer cylinder.</description><creator>Mekanik, Abolghasem</creator><contributor>Paidoussis, M.
