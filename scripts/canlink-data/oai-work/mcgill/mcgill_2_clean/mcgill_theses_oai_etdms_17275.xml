Despite her proclamation of non-belligerency in 1939, she remained during the first phase of the world conflict a willing ally of Britain and France. In the second period she became increasingly cautious, and in the third (that of the Axis zenith) she embraced neutrality. From early in 1943 until the declaration of war, she returned to a pro-Allied partiality, although this was much complicated by Russian presence among the Allies. Indeed, throughout the war her main fear was of Soviet imperialism.</description><creator>Romeril, Paul. E.</creator><contributor>Callard, K.

It bears the same relation to the nervous system as syncope to the vascular. In the one case, the result is caused by a diminution of the nervous fluid, in the other, by a diminution of the blood.” (94).

However, early work with fractional precipitation methods showed that casein was not a single protein, and later, electrophoretic studies proved conclusively that casein is composed or at least three tractions. The tractions were designated as alpha-, beta- and gamma-casein. The physical properties and the composition or the three tractions have been investigated in some detail, but there has been much controversy as to the presence or carbohydrate in casein.</description><creator>Reynolds, Lincoln.

After isolating the lignin with only a little chemical change, it was sulphonated with aqueous sodium bisulphite at pH 5 and 100° to yield an insoluble Stage I (83%) and a soluble Stage I lignosulphonate. The insoluble Stage I lignosulphonic acid was converted to a soluble Stage II product by autohydrolysis under mild conditions. Methylation with diazomethane was used to show that this conversion did not involve the production of free phenolic groups in the lignosulphonic acid.</description><creator>Read, Dale.

In that year Sir Hugh Taylor (1) provided evidence which suggested that atoms and radicals might play important parts as chain carriers in many chemical reactions. Soon after, Rice and his collaborators (2) used Paneth’s (3) metallic mirror test to establish that the thermal decomposition of a number of organic compounds involves these transient species. Using simple elementary reactions involving atoms and free radicals, Rice and Herzfeld were able to devise successful mechanisms for many complex organic decomposition reactions.</description><creator>Ogryzlo, Elmer.

Similarly "system" will refer to collection of subsets of that fixed space. Measure theoretic formulae acquire greater symmetry if we adopt Picone e Viola's notation [6] for union and intersection. The + and E signs are used for unions with + and Ec when these are over disjoint sets; while simple juxtaposition and TT are used for intersection.</description><creator>Normand, Gerald.

In the cash balance terminology of the Cambridge equation, k=M/Y real money balances are set equal to real monetary income times a number, k. The k, in the cash balance equation is the reciprocal of velocity. Any analysis in terms of the proportion that desired cash balances bear to income or total transactions can easily be restated in terms of the velocity of money.</description><creator>Nixon, Justin.

The nephron bas been subdivided into a standard pattern of segments on the basis of its morphology, and various functions were ascribed to each of the segments through the results of physiological experiments (Richards, 1929). The modern expanded knowledge in the fields of physiology and biochemistry has made it apparent that the conventional segments are further subdivided into zones which divide the labour of urine formation, reabsorption and excretion.</description><creator>Nejedly, Vladislava.

Its infective larva occurs in a variety of ground fish in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the seals become infected by eating the infected fish. As the incomplete knowledge of this nematode has caused considerable confusion over its nomenclature and relationships, it is proposed to make it the type species of the new genus Phocanema.</description><creator>Myers, Betty-June.</creator><contributor>Cameron, T.
