Mais le lecteur, qui n'a pas des lunettes de philosophe, a l'avantage de pouvoir se divertir A ce que nous avons appelé dans notre étude " le jeu de l'illusion et de la réalité ", et même se plaire aux surprises que lui réserve une manière inusitée de voir et de peindre le monde. Cette manière, nous la retrouverons partout dans l'œuvre de Giraudoux.</description><creator>Mentha, Guy.</creator><contributor>Launay, J.

Since the war, the Goose Bay Air Base, carved out of the wilderness, has made Labrador the front entrance to Canada for many who arrive here from abroad. In 1954, since this study was begun, the author had the pleasure of opening the McGill Sub-Arctic Research Building at Knob Lake which will act as a centre for field research into this remote area.</description><creator>McKay, Ian.

Details of a frequency standard for operation in the 40,000 mc/s region are included. Carbonyl sulfide has been studied to gain familiarity with and confidence in the instrument as well as to resolve minor disagreements. The magnitude of the Fermi resonance and the vibration-rotation interaction constants have been determined. The spectrum of cyanogens chloride is somewhat complicated by nuclear electric quadrupole-quadrupole interactions as well as Fermi resonance.</description><creator>Mathison, James.

As the terrain characteristics of the survey region bad to be analysed during the preparation of the key it was also possible to prepare a geographical outline at the same time. Owing to the need for minute detail in the widespread photographs chosen for keying, a good deal of time was spent on purely photographic work at the expense of other aspects, notably the detailed geomorphology.</description><creator>Marsden, Michael.</creator><contributor>Bird, J.

Since its development, the airborne magnetometer has helped locate valuable ore deposits, it has aided to decipher geological structures, and it has been used to investigate the possible future activity of volcanoes. Airborne magnetic surveys are not essentially different from land magnetic surveys: aeromagnetic data are obtained and compiled along a continuous line, whereas ground magnetic surveys are made at separate points.</description><creator>Marleau, Raymond.

Systematic exploration of this hitherto inaccessible territory has revealed that potentially economic concentrations of iron, copper and nickel lie within the “Labrador Trough”, a belt of ancient, more or less deformed sediments, which stretches at least five hundred miles from Menihek Lake in the south, northwestward to Payne Bay.</description><creator>Mannard, George.

F. Denstedt, on a study of the means whereby the then existing methods of blood preservation might be improved. Similar investigations were undertaken in many other laboratories throughout the world, particularly in the United States and Great Britain. The availability of blood and plasma for prompt treatment of the wounded at the fighting front accounted for the tremendous saving of lives in World War II as compared with World War I.</description><creator>Malkin, Aaron.</creator><contributor>Denstedt, O.

This is to be expected since casein is the main protein constituent of the milk of all mammals and because it can be readily isolated in a more or less pure state and with reasonably reproducible properties. For one hundred years following Mulder’s discovery that casein may be precipitated from milk by the addition of acid, casein was considered the typical example of a homogeneous protein. It was not until the classical solubility studies of Linderstrom-Lang were published, that casein was definitely shown to be a mixture of proteins.</description><creator>MacRae, Herbert.
