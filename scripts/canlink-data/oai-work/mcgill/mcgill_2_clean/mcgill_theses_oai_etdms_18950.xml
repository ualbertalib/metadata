The older picture, based on the anatomical findings of Cajal and on the Sherrington reflex, was that signals from the receptors made their way to the cortex via the well-defined sensory pathways, were then sorted out as by an immense switchboard, and if they had a clear route continued through to the motor system. The problem of learning was to discover the laws whereby the connections of the hypothetical switchboard became changed.</description><creator>Milner, Peter. M.</creator><contributor>Hebb, D.

Many of the early studies on this problem were done with inadequate analytical methods, and were based on experimental approaches now known to be invalid. In recent years the availability of larger amounts of crystalline adrenal hormones, and of highly purified pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone has led to a renewal of interest in the problem of ketosis; yet the results of recent experiments have often appeared to be just as incompatible as those of earlier studies.

Particular attention has been paid to the dependence of these spectra upon the energy of the bombarding electrons. For this purpose an experimental tube has been built. The principle of analysis which has been used is the differential deflection of electrons, according to their energies, by a transverse electric field.

The first demonstration of hormonal action was shown by Berthold, in 1829 (2), when he extirpated the testes of a cockerel and found regression of its secondary sexual characteristics.

While the answer to this question may be of general interest, it is particularly important in those areas where the frost free period is short or draught sets in early in the season, for, unless a crop can be brought to maturity before adverse weather conditions set in, growing the crop in the particular locality may not be an economic proposition. </description><creator>Isang, Etim Udo.</creator><contributor>Brawn, R.
