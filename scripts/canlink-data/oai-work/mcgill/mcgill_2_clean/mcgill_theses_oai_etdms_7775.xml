[...] Ethics then must deal with the inner process and the outward behaviour as to whether both is right or wrong, good or bad. ...a question of Ethics is to decide which is the highest category, the "content" or the "attitude", and which is primary character or conduct. But this much seems apparent that no act is moral which does not combine both. [...] That faith in a moral ideal is at the root of all morality needs hardly to be proven. [...] There seems to be as much conviction also that this good is the end or purpose of human life. [...] The business of Ethics, then, is to conduct a systematic examination of the various ideals of human life, and to seek to correlate them with the true or absolute ideal of humanity, so that at last the absolute good is discovered.

For lines of such lengths, the highest operating voltages must be used, and in order to justify the great expense of building these long lines, large blocks of power must be transmitted, of the order of 100,000 kilowatts per circuit.

Frequently only a few hybrid seeds are produced, and as it is desired to develop as many second generation plants as is possible, it is necessary to have conditions which will favor both the germination of all the hybrid seeds and a good development of the first generation plants.

It does not touch them directly; they are not intimately concerned with it. To them the criminal is an unnatural being living in a world whereof they have no knowledge, or at most a very superficial knowledge. Their attitude towards him is likely one of benevolent compassion, or benign pity. On the subject of the corrective measures employed their attitude is apathetic, or else violently partisan. If however, it should come about that they are victims of these criminals, the whole question assumes an entirely different aspect. Then, it is to them a matter of vital concern that the guilty ones be apprehended and brought to justice. When one is vitally concerned with some problem that problem becomes supremely important. To understand the criminal we must see him as he lives, and performs his dastardly deeds. He must be considered in the concrete, not in the abstract.[...]</description><creator>MacLennan, M. C.

The stock in such a contest,which is open to the world for egg laying competition,represents selected flocks from a large number of different poultry breeders, most of which are Canadian, whilst some come from the United States of America. Since the egg production comes from a group of selected pens it is not as representative for the Barred Plymouth Rock breed as it would be had all the birds used been from one line of breeding. Nevertheless, since all the pens were under exactly the same neutral management the results obtained should be fairly accurate and useful for such a study.[...]</description><creator>Maw, William Alfred, 1893-1964.</creator><contributor>DuPorte, E. &amp; Rice, J.

Yet when one begins to delve into the records of newspaper activity in Canada's provinces there comes the realization that journalistic endeavour in this country has extended over a period of many years and that the journalistic machinery of present day is only the outcome of a slow and, at times times, a painful growth.

So many factors may operate to influence results that it is extremely difficult to arrive at definite and accurate conclusions. The more fully the investigator is aware of the extent to which his results nay have been influenced by various combinations of factors, the less certain is he that his interpretation of results is correct. Every investigator wishes to obtain accurate data, and to have his conclusions backed by sound experimental evidence. While each investigator realizes that his data obtained from field experiments are not absolutely accurate, many treat numerous sources of errors lightly under the error are so small as to have no material effect on the ultimate results. A discussion of some of the factors which may have a direct and marked effect on results may serve to illustrate this point. Other sources of errors were overlooked for many years through lack of a knowledge of their existence, and doubtless many have yet to be discovered.[...]</description><creator>Schurman, David Cairns.</creator><contributor>Summerby, R.

The practice of supporting the forms in this way eliminates much of the falsework facilitating thereby free movement of men and materials on the floor below.This is a much safer method of construction than reinforced concrete which requires the use of falsework until the concrete is set. However, in the design of the steel frame building no consideration is given to the aduitional strength due to this encasing concrete.[...]</description><creator>Shaw, Gerald E.</creator><contributor>Mackay, H.

A pulp containing the copper ore and the leaching solution is agitated by air or by direct mechanical means, while simultaneously with the leaching of the ore, the copper is being electrolytically deposited directly from the pulp or muddy solution. The regeneration of the solvent used, in this case, sulphuric acid, proceeds simultaneously with the déposition of the copper. The possibility of simultaneous leaching and electrolysis seems to have first occured to Body, who invented and patented the so-called Body Process in 1886.

An attempt was made to obtain seeds of Xanthium from all part of North America and thus to gain some idea of the distribution of species. It was hoped, also, that a study of the plants, from germination to maturity, would throw some new light on the taxonomy by revealing genetic relationships in the genus. An experimental garden has been devoted exclusively to Xanthium for two summers. In 1923, seeds from 22 different sources in North America, were grown. In 1924, all the seeds planted had been collected in two small areas on opposite shores of the St. Lawrence at Montreal. Small numbers of plants have been grown in the McGill University greenhouse during the winter months of both years.

This disease manifested itself by streaks on the stems and petioles, a spotting, curling and shrivelling of the leaves, and irregular brown spots on the fruit, all of which resulted, in the majority of cases, in complete wilting of the whole plant. In other cases a long spindling growth of the upper part of the plant was evident. It was characterised by its sudden onset and virulent nature, and resulted in a loss of one third of the crop. This was the first time that the disease as such had been brought to the attention of the plant pathologist of the institution; but on making further enquiries it was found that a disease of apparently similar nature had infested the greenhouses some nine or ten years before.

In all ethical attempts of the past, there was one particular at least in which they were correct, namely, that man is essentially a creature of desire, ever craving for sane ideal object. Green presents this same truth very vividly and convincingly in his theory of "seif-objectification," H (Bk.II.); and in his doctrine of the nature of consciousness, he attempts to ground this self-objectifying principle. This, in a word, will be our attempt to ground the ideal. [...]</description><creator>Wilkinson, George.</creator><contributor>Caldwell, W. &amp; Ritchie, D.
