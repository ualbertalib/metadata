Although much is known about the mass effects of salesmanship, relatively little knowledge exists on the nature of the face-to-face selling situation. It is an interpersonal situation, involving the interaction of two or more actors: salesman and customer(s). The specific purpose of this interaction is the transfer of a commodity.

Manufacturing is directly responsible for the means of livelihood of one-quarter of the population, and its development is popularly regarded as a barometer of economic maturity and nationhood. A long-awaited Seaway is now being constructed and speculation on area benefits and handicaps is rife.

The lenses were illuminated by a point source positioned at various distances off the principal axis of the system. Scans were made in both the E- and H-planes. Due to the finite size of the lens aperture the intensity distribution in the field of the lens must be described as a diffraction pattern. Although essentially the same for both the E- and H-planes of polarization, the lens pattern was found to deteriorate both in relative intensity and in intensity distribution with the displacement of the source off the principal axis of the system.</description><creator>Bachynski, Morrel Paul.</creator><contributor>Woonton, G.

The nature of the methodology, and the material used, seems to warrant some clarification of the motives for this study. The impetus for the investigation came from three different lines of inquiry: (a) - The problem of disorganization of the individual in psychotherapy which, under certain conditions, may yield beneficial results.</description><creator>Azima, Hassan.</creator><contributor>Scott, W.

His calculations of the quantum yields of several photochemical reactions demonstrated unequivocally that the Einstein Law of Photochemical Equivalence could not be applied to the overall processes. Nernst was one of the first to suggest that atoms were the chain carriers in these reactions, and for this reason the "Nernst Chain" - proposed for the photochemical synthesis of hydrogen chloride - still bears his name.
