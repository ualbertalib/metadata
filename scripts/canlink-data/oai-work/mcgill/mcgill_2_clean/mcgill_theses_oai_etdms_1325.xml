Ibn Jama'ah (639-733 A.H. / 1241-1333 A.D.) was a distinguished Shafi'i Chief Judge and prominent scholar of Islamic studies during the Bahri Mamluk's Sultanate in Egypt and Syria. Ibn Jama'ah's theory of education reflects an emphasis on the Qur'an and hadith as primary sources of knowledge. Specifically, his suggestions for curriculum composition are designed to facilitate the evolution of a pious, religiously oriented generation of scholars. Ibn Jama'ah emphasizes the need for the teacher to foster motivation among his student body. Furthermore, he recommends that the teacher carefully gauge his students' abilities and limits. Another critical component of Ibn Jama'ah's educational program is the need for the teacher to realize the influence he has on his students; consequently, he must carry himself in a respectable and pious manner. He also addresses the various duties needed for a student to excell in his studies. In his evaluation of the teacher and student relationship, one can detect his affiliation with the Sufi khanqah tradition.</description><creator>Husin, Muhammad Said</creator><contributor>Boullata, I.

Through exegesis of 2 Cor 5:1-10, the basic consistency in Paul's thinking and the arguments for and against the intermediate state will be examined. Chapter 1 analyzes what 1 Thess. 4, 1 Cor. 15, and 2 Cor. 5 have to say on the issue, comparing the passages as to content and compatibility. Chapters 2 and 3 pursue more fully questions related to the issue of postmortem existence. Chapter Two deals with Paul's use of verb $ underline{ eta o iota mu alpha sigma beta alpha iota}$ as a metaphor for death and the idea of the intermediate state as soul-sleep (psychopannychism). Chapter 3 explores the matter of Paul's concept of the "I" or "self" (or "naked" self), raised by Paul in 2 Cor. 5:3. The Pauline anthropology is compared with Hellenistic anthropological dualism in order to show the similarities and differences.</description><creator>Harp, Barbara Tychsen</creator><contributor>Wisse, Fred (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Paul, the Apostle, Saint -- Contributions in eschatology</subject><subject>Intermediate state -- Biblical teaching</subject><title>The intermediate state in Pauline eschatology : an exegesis of 2 Corinthians 5, 1-10</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cz30pv741.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q524jq903</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Religious Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8k71nk267</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:06:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this thesis is to demonstrate that through his book. Awlad haratina, Najib Mahfuz is criticizing the role of traditional religion in his society in order to find a new god and a new faith. He is particularly concerned with the silence of God in view of human suffering. Awlad haratina's theme of tyranny and oppression, while an elusive Jabalawi remains secluded, leads to an examination of theodicy. The question of God's justice is raised in order to discover who or what is responsible for evil and the suffering of humanity. Through the death of God, Mahfuz answers this question by proving Him irrelevant and eliminating Him altogether. Mahfuz then introduces what he sees as an alternative to traditional theism: scientific and intellectual exploration.</description><creator>Hannah, Kathryn Jayne</creator><date>1995</date><subject>Maḥfūẓ, Najīb, 1912- Awlād ḥāratinā</subject><title>Theodicy and the death of God in Awlād ḥāratinā by Najīb Maḥfūẓ</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/05741t88w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8k71nk267</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Islamic Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:08612q73h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:06:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Maria Messina (1887-1944) is one of the writers whose work has been "rediscovered" as a result of the recent interest in women writers of the past. Until now, criticism has tended to focus on her representation of the female condition. This thesis attempts to offer a more precise and yet more broadly contextualized characterization of her work. The analysis takes into account the social and economic upheavals of the early decades of this century which affected both men and women. In fact, the crisis of the rigid division of gender roles is shown to be the real thematic source of her work.</description><creator>Haedrich, Alexandra</creator><contributor>Kroha, Lucienne (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Sex role in literature.</subject><subject>Messina, Maria, 1887-1944 -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><title>L' opera narrativa di Maria Messina : maschi e femmine "alla deriva" in un'epoca di transizione</title><language>ita</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mp48sf68t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/08612q73h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Italian</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z603r0491</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:06:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of problem-based learning (PBL) as an alternative teaching method in biology. Eighty-one, ninth grade biology students worked collaboratively in groups, of 2 or 3, to generate a fictitious patient case, which was then exchanged, for other students to solve. This process was repeated on two occasions. Data from pre/post questionnaires and groups' verbal and written protocols were analyzed. Results showed that certain cognitive processes strengthened over time. Significant improvements were also noted in the quality and content of students' written scenarios and solutions, and in students' interest in working collaboratively. Overall, this study confirms that PBL has numerous benefits and holds great potential as an instructional method in biology.</description><creator>Guerrera, Claudia P.</creator><contributor>Lajoie, Susanne P.

I studied the interaction between a contemporary exhibition and professionals variously familiar with the artworld. I find that Fairchild's model is useful as a theoretical framework in coding the protocols and confirm that the think-aloud protocol can provide accurate data with respect to the cognitive activity of an art viewer. I suggest that the viewers' context became the pivotal issue determining the quality of their experience and propose that this context become the focus of further study in the exhibition design process.

The present thesis offers a different angle of analysis by demonstrating the importance of the international context in shaping changes in domestic politics such as those relating to the FTA. The thesis also puts emphasis on the complexity of social support and political bargaining that resulted in the adoption of the FTA. Building of Peter Gourevitch's framework, which evaluates the impact of international crises on domestic politics, the thesis focuses on five possible factors that could explain the free trade outcome. Firstly, constraints and opportunities arising from the international system are assessed to evaluate if the government might have adopted the FTA to protect the "raison d'Etat": it rather appears that it is through the mediation of social actors that the post 1970 international crisis was felt. Secondly, a sectorial analysis finds that two coalitions, each one with two sets of preferences, were opposed on the FTA issue. Thirdly, the role of intermediate associations (business groups, unions and farmers associations) is assessed to see if their impact went beyond the sectorial interest they defended. Fourthly, the influence of economic ideologies is analyzed. Fifthly, the state structure is taken into account to show essentially that the Mulroney government had a double and complementary agenda with the FTA and the Meech Lake negotiations, both of which had a degree of independence from domestic economic and social pressures.

McAlpine, personal communication; Matthew, 1982). To date, there is little research documenting the teaching strategies of different Aboriginal peoples in Canada. The present study documents Cree and Mohawk teachers' beliefs about and use of play as an educational strategy at the primary and early elementary levels, and contrasts this with three non-Aboriginal teachers working in the same communities. Nine Aboriginal teachers were interviewed regarding their beliefs about play as an educational strategy; seven of these teachers were also videotaped teaching. A coding scheme was used to analyse the teachers' videotaped lessons. Similar data were obtained for the non-Aboriginal teachers. The Cree and Mohawk teachers held similar beliefs about play as an educational strategy; their beliefs differed from those of the non-Aboriginal teachers. In terms of their use of play, some differences between the Cree and Mohawk teachers were found; differences between the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal teachers also surfaced. Results support the notion that Aboriginal teacher may differ from non-Aboriginal teacher's in their beliefs about play, and that Cree and Mohawk teachers themselves may use different patterns of play in their lessons.</description><creator>Desjardins, Marlene J.</creator><contributor>McAlpine, Lynn (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Play</subject><subject>Indians of North America -- Education -- Québec (Province)</subject><title>Play as an educational strategy in Aboriginal kindergarten, grade one , and grade two classrooms</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8910jw67h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bz60cz65d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pr76f565v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:06:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study is concerned with the first part of Les Angoysses douloureuses qui procedent d'amours by Helisenne de Crenne which conforms to the writing rules of the rhetorical deliberative discourse. It is destined to a recipient in the text, to try to influence his future course of action, in a determinated way. This persuasion exercise is mostly done with examples which make up the main component of the story. The purpose of the text, explicit, manifest and admitted, is to incite the "dames" to live a life of virtue, without repeating in the future the misdeed, which the narrator is the example. The intent is therefore apparently one of edification. However, a double intention, less apparent, also shows through in the text. The character of Helisenne, far from trying to alert her female readers, is re-enacting her passion by the very fact that she is writing it; she also makes it legitimate by using the exemplum and the godly predestination. Furthermore, she gives another recipient to her writings, her lover, who should be prompted to come to her rescue once he has read the story. This study shows that it is in the superposition of the divergent aims of the deliberative discourse that lies the "delit".</description><creator>Desbiens, Caroline, 1970-</creator><contributor>Desrosiers-Bonin, Diane (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Crenne, Hélisenne de.

Here the main theme derives from the paradoxical nature of the human skin, whose fluid sensory and communicative qualities profoundly shape our psychological functioning, and thus ultimately our creation of (gendered) knowledge in all its forms. Chapter Two seeks to establish some of the possible socio-political implications of a recovered pre-oedipal sensibility, by way of situating the place of the personal within critical discourse--the cross-fertilization of critical theory and self-critical artistic discourses. Using the specific example of film, my central conceit consists in drawing a parallel between the skin and the filmic screen as both being simultaneously introjective and projective liminal membranes. Chapter Three is a case study of sorts, one which traces the manifestations of a liminal subjectivity during a critical phase in the history of my native Nordic culture--the period of transition between pagan and Christian society. Its spirit is then shown to be alive and well within the ensemble films of Ingmar Bergman, whose work has come to stand as something of an archetype of the Nordic film form. The second section, PRAXIS, appropriately provides this project's own creative component, a sketch of a film scenario that I hope to one day be able to liberate from the stasis of the written page and project into the uncertain spaces of a theater screen.</description><creator>Bruteig, Rune</creator><contributor>Monchy, Marike Finlay-de (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Motion pictures -- Aesthetics</subject><subject>Subjectivity in art</subject><subject>Feminism and motion pictures</subject><subject>Object relations (Psychoanalysis)</subject><title>Who's afraid of the Fenris-wolf? : projections of a skin self and Nordic mythographic filmmaking (a feminist and psychoanalytical introspective)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hq37vq546.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9w0325058</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Graduate Communications Program</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fx719p413</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:06:34Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis examines traditional and contemporary perspectives on the nature of spirituality.

After placing Hildegards's antiphons within an historical context in chapter one, chapter two reviews three previous analyses of "O quam mirabilis est" by Bronarski (1922), Cogan (1990) and Pfau (1990). The first two analyses ignore the syntax and expression of the text by focusing on the motivic level. The third analysis, though it embraces the text, lacks a formalization in its theoretical model. None of the analyses respond to the original notation. In response, chapter three examines the notation found in the sources containing Hildegard's music (the Riesenkodex and the Dendermonde codex) and discusses the structural importance of pitches within the neumatic groupings. The resulting graphic analysis adapt Schenkerian analytic notation to represent a hierarchy of pitch relationships. Chapter four applies this methodology to four other antiphons by Hildegard: "Hodie aperuit," "Nunc gaudeant," "O virtus sapientie," and "O virgo ecclesia."</description><creator>Bain, Jennifer, 1967-</creator><contributor>McLean, Donald R.

The author presents a brief synopsis of the present theories of sustainability which he then uses as an evaluative backdrop for the study. Urban transport, architectural design and quality of life issues are addressed. The author conducted an extensive literature review, several case studies and a survey. Conclusions drawn from these studies were used to attempt to envision sustainable home working communities. It was found that sustainability was directly related to whether the home worker telecommutes or operates a home-based business. Home-based business owners continue to be heavily reliant on automobile transportation, while telecommuters make fewer overall trips and travel shorter distances than conventional commuters. Although neither work type demands significant changes to the infrastructure of the typical residence, home-based businesses require more space and more attention to design. Telecommuting has potential adverse side effects of personal isolation and physical strain. To ensure the sustainability of working at home, the practice must be adopted as an integral part of a larger transformation on the scale of the local community.</description><creator>Senbel, Maged</creator><contributor>Friedman, Avi (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Home-based businesses</subject><subject>Sustainable architecture</subject><subject>Telecommuting</subject><title>Working at home and sustainable living : architecture and planning implications</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m326m396d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j098zd20c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9s1618272</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:06:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Public housing represents a significant percentage of the housing stock in many developing countries. Its shortcomings have been identified and examined by many scholars and experts in an attempt to investigate the possibilities of growth and adaptability in future projects. Yet, for many years and through their own initiative, public housing dwellers have been engaged in alteration and extension activities aimed at adapting their dwellings to better suit their needs. These activities have resulted in the transformation of entire housing developments in many parts of the world. Therefore, this study examines the development of transformations in different public housing projects in Egypt and attempts to identify some of the implicit factors that control change at both dwelling and community levels. A wide array of transformation activities were recorded during a survey of twenty projects in Cairo and Alexandria, from which it was possible to establish a typology of transformations and to distinguish between different patterns through which they take place. One project (Ain el Sira) was chosen as a case study in order to examine change of dwelling characteristics from both external and internal aspects. It was found that user transformation of public housing projects should not be considered as a simple space enlargement process, but rather a result of a complex set of inter-related determinants associated with both context and dwelling characteristics. The finding also revealed that in favourable conditions, users were capable of successfully undertaking transformation activities which not only increased the range of used spaces within housing developments, but also created dynamic multi-functional estates that better respond to changing needs of households.

As well, house are not produced with enough flexibility to enable homeowners to perform easy adaptations that would express their own choices and accommodate their particular requirements. On the other hand, due to economic constraints, most first-time home buyers usually cannot afford the professional services of architects in order to have a house specifically designed to suit their needs and aspirations. This research explores the different types of modifications that occupants of affordable single-family housing in Montreal make to their residences upon occupancy. The survey revealed a high level of user intervention--93.6% of the residents made the modifications by themselves. This demonstrates that residents fully engage in housing adaptations when they are given the opportunity to do so, as is the case in the researched houses which offered some type of flexibility in the form of an open and unfinished basement. 108 of the 141 households took advantage of the originally unfinished basement by finishing it and adapting it to their needs and desires. The author concludes that a house should be adaptable and flexible enough to respond to residents' demands, allowing them to adapt their living spaces according to their personal choices and requirements, as well as to personalise it. As well, the author, convinced that houses do not need to be entirely finished since residents will modify them in any event, suggests certain guidelines and provides recommendations on how affordable single-family houses in Montreal can best be designed to allow for post-occupancy adaptation and user intervention.

For Daly the physical and representational needs of society expressed in architecture were always and forever inextricably linked by the universal and permanent pattern of History. Although it was his fundamental thesis that the human sensibility was more important than any other consideration in the creation of architecture, his theory is paradigmatic of the contemporary ideology which attempted to define and systemise the expressive role of architecture according to rational scientific principles, and resulted in the concept of architecture as a prescriptive and predictive process. Given the separation of architectural form and content, presence and meaning, and the consequent challenge to the possibility of shared experience initiated in the Enlightenment which is still an inherent part of our contemporary architectural thought, it is crucial to re-examine the architectural theory of the 19th century as the origin of the modern condition. This thesis is a critical examination of Daly's collections of polemical articles from the Revue as artifacts of architectural knowledge, through an analysis of their form and content in relation to other significant 19th century architectural texts.</description><creator>Merwood, Joanna</creator><contributor>Perez-Gomez, Alberto (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Daly, César, 1811-1893</subject><subject>Architectural criticism -- France -- History -- 19th century</subject><title>Towards the architecture of the future : César Daly and the science of expression</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m900nw635.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3197xn74f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1544br53n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:06:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Nineteenth-century Montreal convents are complex, multi-functional buildings. As a form of collective housing, convents provided an alternative urban "space" for women, one in which they were able to realize themselves individually and collectively. This thesis explores the Mother House of the Grey Nuns, typical of Montreal's convents, as a purpose-built environment for women. The research involves the extensive use of a unique documentary legacy preserved in the archives of the Grey Nuns: the architectural drawings and written accounts of Soeur Saint-Jean-de-la-Croix (1854-1921), in addition to the religious community's annals and period photographs. These documents recorded how the nuns organized their own built environment and permit a reconstruction of the convent's spatial arrangements, one hundred years after the fact. Although this building is monumental and designed by prominent Montreal architect Victor Bourgeau, it is only from exploring the perspectives of the users that we can truly see how large institutions operated. The division of the plans, the massing of the convent and its siting, among other aspects, communicate the nuns' distinct way of life, one that questioned the traditional boundaries of public and private imposed by society in turn-of-the-century Montreal, albeit from a limited position. The convent is situated within the larger context of nineteenth-century Montreal, especially its hospitals, schools, asylums, and homes. While it shared many of the distinctive architectural features that characterized these building types, the convent also differed from them significantly in its organization. This thesis is intended to enrich our understanding of convents, the place in history of religious communities and the development of women in Quebec.</description><creator>Martin, Tania Marie</creator><contributor>Adams, Annmarie (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Soeurs grises -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</subject><subject>Convents -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</subject><title>Housing the Grey Nuns : power, religion and women in fin-de-siècle Montréal</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h415pc55w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1544br53n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wd375z47j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:06:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study retraces the steps of the 17th century architect and engineer Salomon de Caus through his written and built works, in an attempt to understand the relationship between what he made and the model by which his world was comprehended. The central questions examined with regard to his works are: what correspondence do they reveal between language as a means of conveying knowledge, the world as the source of knowledge, and God the divine creator; and whether "meaning" resides within or without this relation. The interpretation of De Caus' works reveals an epistemological model of a world balancing on the threshold of the modern era of scientific discovery and technological progress. His texts and constructions appear as a means of conveying knowledge with the aim of making the Divine appear as mystery in the human world. De Caus is known to operate two principal layers of meaning in his works. One "mathematical" which addresses the intrinsic meaning of the order of the cosmos and the Divine; the other "narrative", "melodie" or "ornamental", addressing the mediation of situational meaning through matter. Human experience and action was a third factor in the process of mediation. Through the intense experience of the moment of performance, whether architectural, theatrical or musical, man could embody the immaterial knowledge of God. The human artefact was a "poetic instrument" guiding man through life. Today, when living in a world where the dominating paradigm reduces understanding to symbolic logic and God has long since been declared dead, De Caus' poetic model remains highly significant.</description><creator>Grillner, Katja</creator><contributor>Perez-Gomez, Alberto (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Caus, Salomon de, d. 1626 -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><title>Automata, perspective and music : poetic instruments in the written garden of Salomon de Caus</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9p290c593.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wd375z47j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1z40kv89w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:06:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis chronicles an attempt to delve into the murky world of image and semblance, illusion and contrivance. The examination and especially the celebration of image and style--of simulation--throughout recent cultural debate is incisively expressed through the framework of popular culture.

America is Disney World; borne of fantasy and ubiquitous iconism. Our cultural atlas reverberates with the energy of cinematic, pulsating and seductive imagery; restrained and unfulfilled by the voyeuristic stance of the pseudo-event.

Borrowing from the Renaissance Hermetic Tradition of power magic in the work of Dr. John Dee, it began in contemplative research mode in order to find sources for action. The project had its final goal, a theatrical performance (masque) to be delivered as an act of inter-subjective exchange extending beyond solipsism by means of thinking through actions and things. The interdisciplinary nature of the event spoke of architecture's ability to bring together various modes of abstract expression (literature, theatre, theory, music, etc.) without attempts at explicit meaning but by searching for implicitness in the juxtaposition of messages and mediums. In its historical survey from ancient Greek sacrificial rituals to present butchering practices, the thesis project presents as a crosscurrent a critique of power and its contemporary implications.

This identity is partly due to the climatic and regional similarity. The remarkable degree of unity and homogeneity amongst Islamic cities is also attributed to the common religious backgrounds and the behavioural expectation of Islamic society in its urban context. In the past, when religion and politics acted as one body, the Islamic building principles played a major role in shaping the traditional settlement of Damascus. Political, economic, social and cultural changes introduced a new system of government. The reform movements changed the structure of the administration and established a new judicial system. The authorities implemented the Building Code and other pieces of legislation, with the object of organizing the growth of the urban form of Damascus. This paper analyzes a cluster of traditional houses in a residential quarter of Damascus, with the objective of exploring the reciprocal effect between the physical form of the cluster and the social life that existed within it. Thereafter, in the same manner, the new settlement currently replacing the old one will be analyzed. These two settlements will be compared, with regard to the traditional building principles in the old quarters, and the new building code and regulations in the new settlements. Building guidelines that make the built environment and the social life of its inhabitants complementary will be the ultimate goal of this thesis.</description><creator>Alwaz, Helal</creator><contributor>Fischler, Raphel (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>City planning -- Syria -- Damascus</subject><subject>Housing -- Syria -- Damascus</subject><subject>Building laws -- Syria -- Damascus</subject><title>Decoding the building code in Damascus : a search for culturally reflected built environment</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tt44pq139.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h415pc565</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gh93h161c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:06:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This paper undertakes to develop an in-depth interpretation of Piranesi's Il Campo Marzio. While drawing heavily from specific details in both the text and images, the study retains a contextual outlook, speculating that Vico's New Science can lend meaning to Piranesi's work. Based primarily on Vico's concept of the Ideal Eternal History, parallels are drawn between the two works. While this provides the key to entering into Piranesi's work, it reveals only its inner horizon, merely describing in different terms what is already there. The insights provided by this exercise, however, demonstrate that the making of architecture as promoted by the Campo Marzio is not unlicensed Romantic freedom, but a fundamental, culturally-bound human activity. The paper concludes, moreover, that the making of the Campo Marzio interpretively re-enacts the original imaginative founding of the Eternal City and, as such, constitutes an attempt to re-found Heroic Rome.</description><creator>Aitken, R.

It is also inhibited by S-adenosylmethionine which has shown to be actively demethylated to form S-adenosylhomocysteine, which is hydrolysed to homocysteine. MTHFR deficiency exhibits well-documented clinical and biochemical symptoms. The human MTHFR cDNA was isolated by Goyette et al (1994), and fifteen mutations have been identified at this locus. An animal model would prove to be useful for designing therapeutic approaches for understanding the pathogenesis of this genetic disease at the molecular level. The mouse MTHFR gene and cDNA have been isolated and partially characterized. Four genomic clones were isolated by library screening. One of these clones (clone 3) contained the 5$ sp prime$ end of the gene and was completely characterized. The clone was shown to have no rearrangements and is to be used to design targeting vectors for 'knockout mice' and mice carrying a common mutation which has been postulated to be a genetic risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The other three clones contain the remaining 3$ sp prime$ portion of the gene. The coding portion has approximately 90% homology with the human cDNA and also shows a similar gene structure. A 2.2 Kb mouse MTHFR cDNA was isolated by library screening and was found to contain a 320 base pair extension at the 5$ sp prime$ end which has not been found in the human cDNA. The cDNA contains exons -1 -3, but also contains two possibly unspliced introns. A portion of this cDNA can however still be used to rescreen libraries to isolate a full length cDNA. The above research is the first genetic data on the mouse MTHFR gene and provides the basis for future research involving mouse models of MTHFR deficiency.</description><creator>Pai, Aditya P.</creator><contributor>Rozen, Rima (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase</subject><subject>Folic acid deficiency.</subject><subject>Mice -- Molecular genetics.</subject><title>Isolation and partial characterization of the mouse gene for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bz60cz66p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qv33rz62r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9g54xk66m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:06:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis, we investigate the suitability of several routing schemes and network topologies for a high speed free-space photonic network that is currently being developed at McGill. We find that deflection routing is a very suitable routing strategy since it does not require expensive buffers at network nodes, and it does not experience deadlock. After reviewing current research in deflection routing for a variety of network topologies, we conclude that the 11 $ times$ 11-torus, the 5-symbol star graph, and the 7-dimensional hypercube are attractive candidates for a photonic network of approximately 120 nodes. Then, we determine efficient embeddings of these three networks into an optical hyperplane which hosts the communication channels of the network in one and two dimensions. While trying to embed the 5-star into the two-dimensional hyperplane, we discover an embedding strategy which allows any n-star to be embedded into any d-dimensional grid of size at most ${ underbrace{n times ... times n} sb{d-1}} times (n!/d!)$ without any bends between neighbours in the n-star. Through simulation, we determine that for a network size of about 120 nodes, the hypercube in seven dimensions offers the most dependable behaviour since its throughput is always above 99.6% and the delay is never greater than 20% of the average distance. However, when we allocate an equal number of communication channels to each node, we find that the star graph offers superior performance due to its low degree and diameter, and when we assign an equal number of communication channels to the three topologies as a whole, the torus outperforms the star and cube due to its efficient embeddings in the hyperplane.</description><creator>Obenaus, Stefan Thomas Henning</creator><contributor>Szymanski, Ted (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Topology of a high speed free-space photonic network</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9p290c60v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9g54xk66m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mg74qp114</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:06:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was employed to monitor the oxidation of edible oils in the absence and presence of antioxidants. Three synthetic antioxidants (butylated hydroxyanisole, propyl gallate and tert-butylhydroxyquinone) were added to menhaden oil at three different concentrations (1%, 0.1%, and 0.01%), and the FTIR spectra of the oils under conditions of oxidative stress were recorded as a function of time. The efficacy of each antioxidant was assessed by monitoring bands at 3444 cm$ sp{-1}$, characteristic of hydroperoxide formation, 971 cm$ sp{-1}$ for trans double bond formation, and 3008 cm$ sp{-1}$ for cis depletion. An FTIR spectroscopic method was also developed for the determination of the peroxide value of edible oils undergoing oxidation, based on the measurement of the 3444-cm$ sp{-1}$ band. The results of the FTIR method were compared to those from both the iodometric chemical method and the enzymatic hemoglobin-methylene blue assay for the determination of hydroperoxide content. The FTIR predictions were within $ pm$3% of the values obtained by both the chemical and the enzymatic method. Finally, the determination of the hydroxyl value of emulsifiers by FTIR spectroscopy was investigated. Both attenuated total reflectance (ATR) and transmission flow cell techniques were used to record the spectra of commercial monoglycerides. Calibration models for the prediction of hydroxyl value from the FTIR spectra were developed using partial-least-squares (PLS) regression for both the ATR and transmission spectra. Cross-validation of the calibration models yielded an overall average error in the predicted hydroxyl values of $ sim$3% for both the ATR and transmission flow cell methodologies. Linear regression of the FTIR-predicted versus the hydroxyl values determined by the reference chemical method yielded r = 0.998 for the ATR and r = 0.997 for the transmission flow cell method.</description><creator>Nicodemo, Antonio</creator><contributor>Ismail, A.
