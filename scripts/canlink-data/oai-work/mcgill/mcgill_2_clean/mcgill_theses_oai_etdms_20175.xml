spinal radiographs for Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) and to estimate the number of cancers at these sites attributable to x-rays. Subjects for this study were patients referred from 1960 to 1979 for AIS to Hopital Ste-Justine, Montreal. About 85 percent of 2,181 subjects were first referred for scoliosis between the ages of eleven and seventeen and the average time under observation was about three years. The mean number of radiographs was about twelve. The mean cumulative dose to the thyroid gland and to the female breast was about three cGy. Seven excess breast cancer and thyroid cancer cases were projected to occur over the lifetime of the women; among these, two excess deaths from cancers were projected. Approximately one in every 250 women in this cohort would be expected to develop breast or thyroid cancer over their lifetime, and one in every 900 women would be expected to develop a fatal cancer.

A recombinant plasmid pGEX-2T-S1 was constructed, containing the glutathione S-transferase gene. The expressed fusion protein was purified and digested with thrombin to produce a recombinant S1 protein (rpS1) containing slightly modified N-terminus. Purified rpS1 was used to raise a rabbit antiserum which recognized rpS1 on immunoblots. A polyclonal antiserum to EF-1$ alpha$ failed to react with rpS1. Similarly the anti-rpS1 does not recognize EF-1$ alpha$ on immunoblots. Anti-rpS1 therefore is able to distinguish pS1 from EF-1$ alpha$ despite their extensive amino acid sequence homology. Anti-rpS1 and anti-Ef-1$ alpha$ will be used to study the similarities and differences between pS1 and EF-1$ alpha$ in vivo and in vitro.</description><creator>Liu, Catherine Heung Luen</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Expression of an EF-1a like rat cDNA, S1, in Escherichia coli and production of a rabbit polyclonal antiserum to the recombinant protein</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bc386k487.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xs55md09s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anatomy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6m311q35h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:42:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Dynamic cardiomyoplasty for hemodynamic support during acute pulmonary hypertension is studied. Five dogs underwent a right latissimus dorsi cardiomyoplasty. A graded acute pulmonary hypertension was later induced by infusion of glass microspheres into the pulmonary artery. A decrease in pulmonary artery flow, systemic pressure and systemic flow resulted. At an optimal level of hemodynamic impairment, the dynamic cardiomyoplasty was able to acutely improve pulmonary artery flow 26.4 $+/-$ 5.84% (SEM) (p $&lt;$ 0.005), mean systemic arterial pressure 11.6 $+/-$ 3.7% (p $&lt;$ 0.05), and the thoracic aorta flow 15.7 $+/-$ 6.3% (p $&lt;$ 0.05). There was a significant beneficial hemodynamic effect demonstrated by dynamic cardiomyoplasty. The degree of improvement in hemodynamic variables could be correlated with the magnitude of hemodynamic impairment present. Dynamic cardiomyoplasty may be useful in patients with right heart failure associated with increased pulmonary vascular resistance.</description><creator>Hill, Andrew Beverly</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><title>Dynamic cardiomyoplasty for acute pulmonary hypertension</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m326m2877.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6m311q35h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Surgical Research</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2b88qd26x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:42:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The present study was conducted in order to investigate the effects of bilingual therapy on the naming skills of a bilingual aphasic patient. The nature of the word-finding difficulties of a French-English bilingual aphasic subject was assessed. Theory-based anomia therapy was administered to the patient first in English and then in French to explore within- and across-language treatment effects. General language skills were also assessed before and after therapy. Results revealed significant improvement in naming of treated words, but very limited generalization to untreated items in only one of the languages. Transfer of therapy effects from treated to untreated language was not observed. Findings are discussed in relation to the efficacy of bilingual therapy; implications for models of bilingual lexical organization are considered.</description><creator>Rhéaume, Agathe</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Health Sciences, Speech Pathology.</subject><title>Bilingual aphasia : efficacy and generalization of bilingual therapy</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3f4626587.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2b88qd26x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Human Communication Disorders</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:m039k617h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:42:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The provision of urban services is one of the most important issues in the process of urbanization. However, more than half of the urban population in developing countries does not enjoy any of these services yet. The public sector has been unable to provide services to the ever-increasing urban population. This failure has been met by the involvement of the private sector in the provision of services: nevertheless, private services are only provided to those who can afford them. The urban poor, who are the majority of the population in urban centres, are not able to afford those services. In the absence of public and private services, the poor have managed themselves to provide services. However, the provision of services by the informal sector has been attacked by governments, which have rarely evaluated or understood this sector. This thesis investigates how the informal sector has created different networks to provide services. In order to find out how exactly this phenomenon has taken place in poor communities, an informal settlement was selected in Bogota, Colombia for a case study. Service networks were identified and classified according to their nature, the operational and technical aspects were described, and, finally, the accepted level of services by the members of the community was analyzed and inferences were drawn. In this way, the studies showed that the informal sector through the use of networks assembled by community-based organizations and/or assembled by different individuals with private initiative were successfully providing services to the poor.</description><creator>Ortega, Maria I.

The author's goal in this study is to demonstrate the validity of four variables in providing information about prospective home buyers in a particular site in order to define their housing needs during the programming stage. Past studies suggested four variables from which basic design guidelines could eventually be extracted: socio-demographic characteristics, type of household/life cycle stage, economic characteristics and mobility. The validity of these variables were tested by the author in four case studies which included several low-cost housing projects in metropolitan Montreal. Information from indirect sources (i.e. literature survey and evaluation of existing projects), was compared to direct sources (i.e. target projects in which the information was readily available). The results established the relevance of some of the variables, and indicated that reliable information could be obtained by architects and housing researchers from indirect sources, thereby, optimizing time and resources.</description><creator>Angel, Norma Lucia</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Poor -- Housing -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- Case studies</subject><subject>Housing</subject><title>Criteria for identifying housing user spatial needs through descriptive socio-economic variables</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vq27zp526.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36tz74f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9593tw26n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:42:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The study focuses on the cognitive assessment of certification examination in medicine. The purpose was to investigate the relationship between the structure of the examination questions and the examinees' written responses. The responses from three groups of residents with undergraduate degrees from McGill (3), Toronto (2) and Manitoba (2) medical schools were used. A sample of one basic science and two clinical question in Endocrinology were selected. The responses were analyzed using cognitive methods which provided a qualitative assessment of subjects' knowledge structures relative to task. The results showed that the responses did not always correspond to task requirements. There was a general tendency to focus on specific details that the subjects understood at the expense of the global aspect of the question. There was a greater variation in performance within groups than between groups. The results also suggest that undergraduate education may have less influence on the performance in certification examination than residency training. The importance of developing examination questions with high construct and criterion validity is discussed.</description><creator>Josif, Dina</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Medical education -- Canada</subject><subject>Physicians -- Canada -- Certification</subject><title>Cognitive assessment of certification examination in endocrinology</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5h73px10m.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9593tw26n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2n49t313v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:42:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The thesis is a short novel, Prague Summer, with a critical afterward. The novel is an account of Alexandra Adams' journey to Prague the summer after the "Velvet Revolution." Juxtaposed with the narrator's first-person recollections of that time are her meditations about the body, where she explores the degree to which she can rely on her body to speak the truth. Ultimately, the text is both an account of the narrator's idiosyncratic artistic journey and a record of the processes involved in self-transformation. The required critical afterward is in two parts. The first provides a summary of Richard Rorty's account of language and selfhood. The second considers Proust, Kundera, and Johnson as liberal ironist writers and examines the relationship between the contingency of language and the contingency of self in their texts.</description><creator>Johnson, Gillian K.

High rates of fertilization increased soil test P and K but decreased soil test Ca and Mg and soil pH. Irrigation decreased soil test K, Ca and Mg. In both years maximum grain yields (at 15.5% moisture) were obtained when all factors were at high levels. Hybrid Pioneer 3925 and and hybrid CO-OP 2645 produced a maximum yield of 11.9 and 15.2 Mg ha$ sp{-1}$ in 1984 and 1985, respectively. Increasing plant population alone increased grain yield from 9.6 to 10.4 Mg ha$ sp{-1}$ in 1984, bu increases in grain yield with high plant population in 1985 could only be obtained when high rate of nutrients and supplemental irrigation were applied. Nutrient uptake was usually greater for hybrid 2645 than hybrid 3925 in 1985, and greater for hybrid 3925 than for hybrid 3949 in 1984. Increasing plant population, rate of fertilization as well as available soil moisture generally brought about greater nutrient uptake. Ear leaf nutrient concentration at silking time was influenced by these factors but the differences obtained were not agronomically significant.</description><creator>Rémillard, Michel</creator><date>1987</date><subject>Corn -- Québec (Province) -- Soils.</subject><subject>Corn -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Corn -- Yields -- Québec (Province).</subject><title>Effect of hybrids, plant populations, rates of fertilizer and irrigation on soil test levels, field and nutrient uptake with corn (Zea mays L.) in Quebec</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3t945r999.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8336h2998</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Renewable Resources</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gf06g397b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:42:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of the work contained in this thesis was to investigate whether experimental paradigms based on the system identification approach are an effective clinical assessment tool. This was accomplished by conducting two companion studies: a reliability study on a group of fifteen control subjects and a case study of an individual who had sustained a unilateral undisplaced ankle fracture. The data collected in both studies included ankle angular position, torque, and Tibialis Anterior and Triceps Surae electromyograms. From these data, measures of both static (e.g. range of motion) and dynamic (e.g. estimated elastic stiffness) joint function, were obtained. A number of clinically relevant variables (plantarflexion MVC, dorsiflexion MVC, range of motion, passive torque, K offset, low K region, and the intercept of the K-absolute torque relation) were shown to be reliable. In addition, the results of the case study demonstrated that it would be feasible to use these experimental procedures and analytic methods on individuals who have sustained orthopedic trauma. Finally, certain variables (the K offset, the slope and intercept of the K-torque relation, and a low stiffness region) appeared to be sensitive to the clinical changes associated with orthopedic pathology.</description><creator>Morier, Rita</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Health Sciences, Rehabilitation and Therapy.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><title>Dynamic joint mechanics as an objective clinical measure of ankle function</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3484zh850.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gf06g397b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Physical and Occupational Therapy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9593tw27x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:42:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The myofibrillar proteins, myosin and actin, were quantitated using N$ sp tau$-methylhistidine determined from selected avian white and red skeletal muscles of randomly chosen young and adult white Leghorn chickens. No significant difference (P = 0.01) was noted with respect to muscle type or age in N$ sp tau$-methylhistidine levels which ranged from 0.383 to 0.637 g/kg protein, translating into a myofibrillar protein content ranging between 532.68 to 579.77 g/kg protein. The connective tissue and collagen content, on the other hand, were calculated using 5-hydroxylysine levels in muscle tissue (0.276 to 1.273 g/kg protein) and were found to be significantly higher (P $&lt;$ 0.01) in avian red muscle tissue ranging from 50.19 to 53.80 g/kg protein as compared to white muscle tissue (13.41 to 19.43 g/kg).

Rabbinic exegesis places these objects in new and innovative contexts. That is, the Rabbinic exegetes speak of the object's origin, history and fate: the circumstances under which the object was created, how it came into the possession of a Biblical character, its destiny, and, in some cases, its role in the Messianic era. This thesis examines Rabbinic interpretations of eight Biblical objects: Adam's garments, Abraham's ram, Solomon's throne, the staffs, asses, altars and wells used by various characters, and a divine fire. This is the first collection of the numerous parallel sources that deal with each of these objects. The traditions regarding these objects illustrate the Rabbis' concern with unity and continuity: different Biblical characters and events are linked together by means of the objects. The Rabbinic idea of the transmission of Biblical objects parallels the Rabbis' view of their own literature as having been transmitted through the generations.</description><creator>Pearl, Gina</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Legends, Jewish</subject><subject>Midrash</subject><subject>Rabbinical literature</subject><title>Adam's garments, the staff, the altar and other biblical objects in innovative contexts in rabbinic literature</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rb68xc780.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xp68kh487</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Jewish Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):20200</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
