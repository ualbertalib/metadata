This boom, involving the reticular system of the brain, has encompassed diverse fields of study, including psychology. Several symposia, numerous reviews and hundreds of papers devoted to this system emphasize its increasing popularity among those interested in cerebral function. The inclusion, in a recent introductory textbook of psychology (Hebb, 1958), of the roles which the reticular system may play in behavior, is an indication of its importance in present psychological thinking.</description><creator>Cooper, Roderick.

One man's enmity can change the course of history, and in the seventeenth century one man’s humanitarianism changed the outlook of an age. Brahe, Kepler and Gilbert had understood the advances of science better than he, and had known the value of repeated observation. Other dreamers had the idea of a co-operative group of scientists. The push came not directly from science but from social reform and it was Francis Bacon who understood the pessimism of his time and where the stumbling-blocks lay.</description><creator>Cleghorn, Sheena.</creator><contributor>Files, H.

In the Old Testament the Church is the "people of God", Israel, a community of people, chosen by the act of God. The Suffering Servant of the Lord in Deutero-Isaiah represents in his one person the community of those faithful to God, the Remnant, the true Israel.

Typically, however, a response to a stimulus is not an isolated bit of behavior, but one incident in a long series of responses. In behavior such as speech or piano playing, for example, the important factor is not the single response, but the response in its temporal relation to others.

This change in morphology was misleading as investigators believed they were not isolating the correct pathogenic organisms. The confusion continued until the pathogenic fungi were shown to change their morphology as a result of temperature changes.

Mirabeau, Brissot, and Condorcet brought politics and journalism into the closest union. By October, 1789, three political groups clearly stood out in the National Assembly: the aristocrats, the moderates or "monarchiens", and the so-called patriots.

What was the nature of the early social life in French Canada, where the dominant form of social grouping was to be the parish? Much has been written of the early French seigneurs-- the noblemen who came to the wilderness that was Canada, and who established their large estates, or seigneuries. But it is significant that this so-called superior class contributed little to the actual colonization of Canada, and left no lasting institution.[...]</description><creator>Lieff, Pearl Jacobs</creator><date>1940</date><subject>Parishes -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Urbanization -- Québec (Province)</subject><subject>Québec (Province) -- Social conditions.</subject><title>The urbanization of the French Canadian parish</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9p290f188.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v692t994r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Sociology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):16775</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
