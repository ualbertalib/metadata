But it is mainly in his enigma novels that this denunciation becomes more forceful. From the narrators' perspective, fraud and assassination have enriched the Camps (Madame Firmiani) and Lanty (Sarrasine ) families, as well as the bankers---Taillefer (L'Auberge rouge) and Nucingen (La Maison Nucingen). Legal criminality, an eminently serious theme of Balzac's critical realism, is narrated by way of enigma games and their everlasting companion, mystification. A better grasp of the plot's central role leads the reader to discover legal criminality, since the narrative structure restores order between fable (intricacy of the crime story) and discourse (invention of crime as an enigma). To relate circumstances leading to the solution of wealth enigmas, Balzac exploits enigma games as an essence of orality, thus giving his fiction the style of a conversational game. Furthermore, he uses a diversity of characters and narrative processes to create uncertainties, suggest clues, denounce inconsistencies. The balzacian literary universe exploits the classical poetics of enigma, developing the enigma from a well-known fact: enrichment by criminal means is an open secret. The point of distinction between Balzac's enigmas and other novels is that they do not really aim at elucidating a mystifying crime, such as in Edgar Allan Poe's novels, but rather at revealing the subtle art of deception. Balzacian "intellectuals", criminals of a new kind, know how to evade the law and take advantage of its loopholes. The narrators, wishing to satisfy the readers' wish to know "the chemical process for oil burning in Aladdin's lamp", must not only specialize their narrative structure to achieve this goal, but also trick the readers into keeping interested in stories which must seem ever more captivating as they become more meaningless. Set between Vidocq's loitering and Dupin's readings, between a spy's memory tracking and a detective's syllogistic intelligence, the dramaturgy of "Faits divers", in the world of Balzac, does not condone nor condemn any of these manifestations of enigma, as it is first and foremost a narrative adventure.</description><creator>Cournoyer, Céline.</creator><contributor>Morisot, Jean-Claude (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Crime in literature.</subject><subject>Balzac, Honoré de, 1799-1850 -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><title>Un noeud dans un jonc : fonctionnement de l'énigme chez Balzac</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2b88qd83j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36v030r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:np193b64h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:14Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The role of occupational exposures in the genesis of airways disease may be underestimated in workforce studies because of the "healthy" worker effect, due either to those with more resistant airways entering a workplace or those with work related airways disease changing or quitting their job. Both effects are minimised in population-based studies which have the disadvantage that occupational exposures are of necessity self-reported. The overall goal of this research was to develop and validate an instrument to measure occupational exposures in epidemiologic research in general population studies of airways disease. The study hypothesis was that self-reported exposure information pertinent to airway disease was as accurate a reflexion of exposure as information derived from industrial hygiene expertise. To examine the study hypothesis, use was made of occupational questionnaires completed by 338 adults participating in a Montreal community based study. A list of 927 reported jobs was submitted for coding of exposures to 2 industrial hygienists working independently to code exposures. Intra-subject reproducibility of questionnaire information, assessed using a test-retest approach in 33 subjects showed good overall concordance for most components of the work history. Inter-rater reliability (between hygienists) was also good for some categories of exposures. Validity analysis of self-reported exposure, using as a reference criterion the exposure coding by either hygienist lead to poor values for sensitivity and phi-coefficients but not for specificity. Slight improvement in sensitivities and phi-coefficients was found for latest job. While smoking, a family history and atopy were determinants of asthma in multivariate models, significant exposure response relationships were obtained only with self reported exposure, not with exposures coded by either hygienist. Nevertheless the coefficients and confidence intervals for self-reported exposures were, for most part, in the same direction and range as those for exposure coded by the 2 hygienists. These results are consistent with the study hypothesis that self reported exposures perform comparably, possibly even better than exposures based on industrial hygiene expertise in characterising exposure response relationships for airway disease in community based studies.</description><creator>De Grosbois, Sylvie.</creator><contributor>Becklake, Margaret R.

The model considers the possibility of a pressure build up in the cathode region due to the strong vaporization of the cathode, the formation of a cathode sheath according to the Bohm's model, and the ion-enhanced thermo-field emission of electrons by the cathode surface. The self-sustaining operating conditions of the discharge are defined by two simple criteria based on particle and energy balance considerations. Results clearly show the necessity of having high local metallic vapor pressures in the cathode region of non-refractory cathodes in order to have a self-sustaining arc attachment. A minimum pressure of at least 19 atm is needed for a Cu cathode. This minimum pressure is shown to decrease as the cathode material boiling temperature increases according to an exponential decay law. Current densities of the order of 1010 A m--2 are maintained at the surface of a Cu cathode mainly by the emitted electrons. A comparison of the three different models for the electron emission current found in the literature allowed to define the limits of validity of each model for two typical arc-cathode interaction systems, and to evaluate the underestimation made on the emission current density when a less appropriate model is used. This underestimation is shown to cause an overestimation of important parameters such as the cathode surface temperature and metallic vapor pressure in the cathode region. An analysis of the mechanisms of heat transfer to the cathode surface allowed to show that the confinement of the cathode spot plasma forming the arc attachment could favor the production of vapors to the detriment of liquids. Such a phenomenon is of importance in Arc Ion Plating for instance. Heat losses by conduction in the cathode bulk larger than 1010 W m--2 are shown to favor the formation of liquid</description><creator>Coulombe, S.

The study used the concept of a transferred-arc reactor which produces AlN ultrafine powders in two stages: evaporation of aluminum (Al) metal by the transferred-arc in non nitriding conditions; and the reaction between Al vapour and ammonia (NH3) in a separate tubular reactor. A new version of this reactor concept was built in which the transferred-arc chamber and tubular reactor were vertically aligned. This reactor design allowed the study of both radial and axial mixing of ammonia with the plasma chamber off-gas. Ultrafine powders with a specific surface area (SSA) in the range of 38--270 m2/g were produced in two plasma chamber off-gas temperature levels (1800 and 2000 K), with different quenching intensities, and two different plasma gas compositions (pure Ar and Ar/H2 mixture). The dependence of the particle size and composition on the reactor operating conditions was investigated. Depending on the plasma gas composition, two different trends were observed for the SSA as a function of quenching intensity, with the radial injection of NH3. A two-dimensional numerical model was developed for the nucleation and growth of ultrafine particles in this system, using the method of moments. A new equation for the nucleation rate for the AlN system was developed. This equation considers the effect of reaction on the surface of clusters of the new phase. This new modelling approach could explain the trends observed experimentally. The importance of the mechanisms for the gas-to-condensed phase transition in the AlN system were examined. The sinterability of the powder produced was examined. Sintering to full density was achieved at 1550°C. Because of the high oxygen content of the powder, a second phase identified as aluminum oxynitride (ALON) was observed to form.</description><creator>Da Cruz, Antonio Carlos.</creator><contributor>Munz, Richard J.

However, application of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in mouse has been hindered by technical difficulties related to the characteristics of mouse cytogenetics. To implement FISH as a tool for the mouse genome project, we developed high-resolution FISH and applied it to mouse and comparative genetics. Using an original technique, we obtained high-resolution replication R-banded mouse chromosomes (over 500 bands per haploid). We constructed a new high-resolution R-banding idiogram, for an easier identification of mouse chromosomes allowing mouse gene mapping with greater precision. Two mouse renal Na-Pi cotransporter genes (Npt1 and Npt2) were assigned to mouse chromosome region 13A3-A4 and 13B respectively. The autosomal localization excluded Npt1 and Npt2 as direct disease genes for X-linked hypophosphatemia and implicated them as candidate genes for autosomally inherited hypophosphatemia, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria and hypophosphatemic bone disease. This study demonstrated that gene mapping using FISH is a direct approach in linking genetic diseases and relevant function genes. In order to directly generate information transferable from mouse to human, we conducted comparative gene mapping study by FISH. Human HLCS, mapped to human chromosome 21q22.1, was assigned to mouse chromosome region 16C4 with a human probe. Conversely, mouse Mborg-1 gene, localized to mouse chromosomes 2H1, was mapped to human chromosomes 20q13 with the murine probe. Moreover, two clusters of mouse gene/DNA marker in the region of Bcg and Lp locus at mouse chromosome 1C4, 1H1 respectively were cross-mapped to human chromosomes 2q35 and 2q23 respectively. The results yields higher resolution than linkage studies and thus allowed us to narrow down the chromosomal region containing the human homologues, as a first step for the cloning of the human genes. In an attempt to positionally clone the Lp gene, we established for the first time a linear relationship between optical distance in interphase nuclei and physical distance between DNA sequences, ranging from 130kb to 1500kb, using two-color FISH. The relative position and genomic distance between four markers flanking Lp locus was effectively estimated.</description><creator>Zhang, Xiao-Xiang.</creator><contributor>Eydoux, Patrice (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Biology, Genetics.</subject><title>Development of high-resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization applied to the study of mouse and human genetics</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n870zs48p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xk81jn25m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pathology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fn1070886</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>New classes of monomers containing heterocyclic groups have been prepared in good yield from readily available compounds. The heterocyclic groups were phthalazinone, quirnazolinone, benzopyrenequinone and acridone. Bisphthalazinones, such as oxy-7-bis(1,2-dihydro-4-phenylphthalazinone) were reacted with a series of activated aryl halides to give high molecular weight novel poly(phthalazinone)s in a one-step reaction involving the formation of a N-C bond. A series of novel quinazolinone containing monomers synthesized for nucleophilic aromatic displacement polymerization reactions, bisphenols and activated difluorides, were unstable under the polymerization conditions. Only low molecular weight oligomers were formed. Two new quinazolinone diamines, oxy-bis(1,4-phenylene)-bis[3-(4-aminophenyl)-1-oxo-quinazolin-2-yl] and 2-(4-aminophenyl)-3-amino-4-quinazolinone were synthesized. They did not form high molecular weight polyimides because of low reactivity or instability of the monomers. A series of high molecular weight polyimides were synthesized from 2-(4-aminophenyl)-16-amino-4-quinazolinone either by one-step solution polymerization or two-step low temperature solution polymerization followed by thermal cyclodehydration. The new monomer, 1,5-bis(4-fluorobenzoyl)naphthalene, was polymerized with a series of bisphenols to form high molecular weight poly(arylene ether)s containing the 1,5-dibenzoyl unit. 1,5-bis(4-fluorobenzoyl)naphthalene was converted to 2,3;7,8-bis(4-fluorobenzoyl)pyrene-1,6-quinone by a Scholl reaction using antimony pentafluoride. It was reacted with bisphenols, however because of side reactions only crosslinked insoluble material formed. A series of novel acridone containing monomers, such as N-benzyl-3-chloro-6-fluoroacridone were synthesized for nucleophilic aromatic displacement polymerization reactions. High molecular weight poly(arylene ether)s containing the acridone, moiety could not be obtained because of instability or low reactivity of the monomers. Model reactions on acridone derivatives were carried out. The fluorine at the 3-position on acridone can be displaced by phenolate anion quantitatively. New acridone monomers which can be synthesized using this reaction were proposed. All the high molecular weight novel polymers synthesized have very high glass transition temperatures and excellent thermal stabilities. Films made from the polymers had high moduli and maintained the high moduli to high temperatures.</description><creator>Yoshida, Shu.</creator><contributor>Hay, Allan S.

A novel 3'-phosphonate building block 105 is synthesized and characterized. During the synthesis of the common precursor 86, unusual base-promoted desilylation of epoxide 80 and vinylselenides 85 and 87 are reported. The instability of the tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) and the tert-butyldiphenylsilyl (TBDPS) protecting groups may be attributed to the participation of the uracil C2-oxygen anion. The synthesis of a number of novel bicyclic phosphonate analogs 92b to 95b is described. In search of alternate cyclopropanation methods, dimesylate 113 was synthesized and characterized. Dimethyl methyl phosphonate anion treatment produced 2'-keto nucleoside derivative 114. The synthesis of a novel reactive epoxide equivalent, the 2 ',3'-cyclic sulfate 119, is described. Dimethyl methylphosphonate anion treatment produced a furane derivative 120 in trace amounts. Reaction of azide anion with cyclic sulfate proceeded regioselectively and gave only 3'-azido nucleoside 122. The observed regioselectivity is novel and may be of great interest to nucleic acid chemists.* A novel class of galactose and lactose-based glycoconjugates 23 and 24 has been synthesized and fully characterized. During the preparation of these glycoconjugates, novel N-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) and N-carboxybenzyl (Cbz)-protected galatosylated and lactosylated linker intermediates 7, 8, 11 and 12 have been synthesized and characterized.

New hardware and software have been designed to enable the scanner to acquire image data in 8 distinct segments of the acquisition memory sequentially and repetitively when gated by an auxiliary signal. For PET activation studies, these modifications facilitate the application of a stimulation pattern consisting of 8 phases. By synchronizing the phases with the acquisition, the time course of the response to the stimulation is measured. Simulation and phantom tests were performed to verify the system performance before applying it to human subjects. A 11C-CO generator was developed in order to supply gaseous 11C-CO to be administered to the subjects with bolus inhalation. A multiple inhalation method was devised which increases the efficiency of the uptake of the radioactive tracer by up to a factor of 2 when compared with the conventional single bolus inhalation method, which results in an increase in SNR by a factor of 1.4. The EVR technique has been applied to CBV measurements using vibrotactile stimulation to the fingers of the right hand of the subject. The averaged results among 4 subjects show a clear response in the somatosensory right-hand area, with a measured rise time of 7.2 +/- 1.9s and a decay time of 13.2 +/- 2.2s. The technique maybe applied to other PET activation studies such as visual, auditory and olfactory studies.</description><creator>Wang, Bing, 1966-</creator><contributor>Thompson, Christopher J.

The method has been used in the aluminum foundry to assess the extent of grain refining and the degree of eutectic modification. Although the method has been, to a certain extent, successfully used, it has some serious drawbacks. The most apparent include: (a) poor reproducibility, (b) poor control over heat extraction and cooling rates, (c) a batch operation, and (d) a manual operation which is difficult to automate and computerize. To overcome these shortcomings associated with current thermal analysis methods, a new technique of performing thermal analysis on aluminum alloys has been devised. Besides being semi-continuous, the new system is easier to use, more dependable and, most importantly, capable of performing thermal analysis tests at controlled and variable cooling rates throughout the entire solidification process. The new thermal analysis technique is based on heat pipe principles in which a small quantity of a melt, residing in the core of a heat pipe probe, is solidified, and its cooling curve is acquired. Once the cooling curve has been acquired, the probe is instructed to remelt the sample and await instructions to run another test. The new probe, which resides in the melt and need not be withdrawn, is used to solidify the sample under predetermined and controlled conditions. The operating principles of the new thermal analysis device are based on heat pipe technology. In simple terms, a heat pipe is a high heat transfer device capable of transferring large amounts of heat from a source to a sink by taking advantage of the high heat transfer rates associated with the evaporation and condensation of a working fluid placed inside the pipe. Heat is absorbed at the heat source (evaporator) and dissipated at the heat sink (condenser) at approximately isothermal conditions, and hence the thermal gradient from one extreme end of the pipe to the other is minimal, the amount of heat transferred is large, and the thermal resistance is small. The new thermal analysis device has been used to produce cooling curves of various aluminum alloys. The device has also been shown to detect the extent of grain refinement, degree of eutectic modification, and formation of intermetallic phases. In addition, the device has been used to quantify the amount of iron in aluminum melts. Thermal analysis results obtained with the new technique are in good agreement with those of conventional thermal analysis. In conjunction with the new device, a control scheme has been devised to control the heat extraction and cooling rates during cooling of aluminum alloys. Finally, a heat transfer and solidification model of the heat pipe thermal analyzer is derived and validated based on the acquired experimental data. Thermal analysis results are reported for pure aluminum, three casting alloys: hypeoeutectic aluminum silicon (A356 and A319), and a eutectic aluminum silicon (413) alloy, and a wrought alloy of the 6000 series (6061).</description><creator>Mahfoud, Musbah.</creator><contributor>Gruzleski, J.

Additional findings indicate that astrocytes and/or RGCs may synthesize laminin alpha2 along the developing optic pathway. Thus, laminin alpha2---in a complex other than laminin-2---may serve as an adhesive substrate for RGC growth cones in vivo. In keeping with the presence of a laminin chain variant in the developing optic pathway, prior studies have shown that retinal neurons express laminin-binding integrins. The growth of avian retinal neurons on laminin-1 is diminished between E6 and E12, over which time alpha6beta1 integrins are transcriptionally and/or posttranslationally inactivated. Ciliary neurotrophic factor and neurotrophins are reported to increase endogenous alpha6 and beta1 integrin mRNA levels in cultured chick retinal neurons. These experiments suggest a role for neurotrophic factors in integrin regulation during development. Furthermore, in order to help determine whether integrin up-regulation could promote neurite outgrowth by older developing RGCs, the rat alpha1 integrin subunit was ectopically expressed in the nervous system of transgenic mice using the rat neuron-specific enolase promoter. This subunit is part of a laminin receptor (alpha1beta1) which functions in axonal outgrowth. Older developing RGCs in NSE-alpha1 mice show a moderate increase in their ability to grow neurites on laminin-1 in vitro, at a time when neurite outgrowth by wild-type RGCs on laminin-1 is meager. This animal model suggests that integrin up-regulation in RGCs could promote optic nerve regeneration in adult mammals. Finally, cones are shown to express alpha2, alpha3 and beta1 integrin subunits on their inner segment. Cone photoreceptor cells are surrounded by a specialized matrix. Since cone matrix sheaths are believed to mediate physical interactions between the neural retina and the retinal pigment epithelium, results suggest that alpha2beta1 and/or alpha3beta1 integrins may play a role in retinal attachment via interactions with matrix ligands.</description><creator>Morissette, Nathalie.</creator><contributor>Carbonetto, Salvatore (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Functional studies of laminin-binding integrins and distribution of the laminin alpha2 chain in the developing visual system</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9593tw90p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wd375z158</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qv33rz410</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The problem of blast initiation of gaseous detonation has been studied by focusing on the onset of detonation, i.e. the development of a pressure pulse during the quasi-steady period which leads to an abrupt acceleration to form a self-sustained detonation. This study has been carried out by numerical simulation of the one-dimensional Euler equations in a planar geometry. For the chemical kinetics model, a single-step Arrhenius law was assumed. It was found that for the critical energy required to initiate a detonation, the onset starts with the development of a pressure pulse between the reaction front and the shock front. The formation of the pressure pulse was attributed to the rapid energy release in the long induction length during the quasi-steady period. It was observed that within the framework of the present analytical model of a single-step Arrhenius rate law without losses, it is difficult to define a precise value for the critical initiation energy. However, the abrupt increase in the run up distance when the initiation energy reaches some critical range can be used to define the critical initiation energy. The present results show that initiation process has the same mechanism for both stable and unstable detonations. However, for unstable detonations when the activation energy is very high, no unique value can be defined for the critical initiation energy. It was found that analytical models based on the Zeldovich criterion cannot predict the critical initiation energy over the full range of activation energies considered in this study. This is because the Zeldovich criterion does not consider any dynamic effects during the quasi-steady period. Comparing previous research on initiation which used other initial conditions and the "blast initiation" which was studied in the present work, it was concluded that the onset of detonation during the quasi-steady period has the same mechanism for "deflagration to detonation transition" and "direct initiation</description><creator>Mazaheri Body, Kiumars.</creator><contributor>Lee, J.

The genomic cloning of leukotriene A4 hydrolase demonstrates that the gene is greater than 35 kb, has 19 exons, and the zinc binding domain is divided between exons 10 and 11. The chromosomal localization of the gene is 12q22 and by southern blot analysis is a single copy gene. The gene has two putative xenobiotic response elements. The relevance of these elements may prove important since the genomic cloning of soluble epoxide hydrolase, which is involved in detoxification of xenobiotics, has a similar exon intron organization as that discovered for leukotriene A4 hydrolase. LTA 4 hydrolase has been expressed in a baculovirus expression system and we have reconstituted transcellular metabolism in these cells using recombinant 5-lipoxygenase. The recombinant LTA4 hydrolase was purified and used to locate the covalent attachment site of LTA3 and delineate the region involved in suicide inactivation of the enzyme. We demonstrate the first identification of the peptide Asp375-Lys385 containing the LTA 3 adduct by mass spectroscopic analysis. Tyr378 has been identified as the attachment site of LTA4 and our data are consistent with LTA3 covalent binding to the same residue and possibly with Tyr383. This is consistent with one possible mechanism in which the Tyr378 residue may act as a nucleophile to deprotonate a H2O molecule creating a nucleophilic attack at the C12 position of LTA4 and resulting in the formation of stereospecific LTB4. The elucidation of the catalytic mechanism of the conversion of LTA4 into LTB4 will provide insight into the development of potent selective inhibitors which can prove effective in various pathophysiological conditions.</description><creator>Mancini, Joseph A.

The population consisted of over four hundred nurses who work in medical surgical units of four McGill University teaching hospitals. A total of one hundred and fifty-nine useable questionnaires were collected for a response rate of 40%. Respondents were full and part time nurses with an average age of 36 years and eight years of nursing experience. More than 90% of the nurses reported primary nursing/total patient care to be the model in use. However, the variations in the attributes of delivery systems within that one model attest to the variations that exist within models. Feedback, communication, support for autonomy and time on patient care contributed to the development of the internal psychological states. The proposals of the Job Characteristics Model were generally supported by the data. The psychological states, referred to by Hackman and Oldham as the causal core of the model, mediated between the core job characteristics and the outcomes. The factors of autonomy, significance and meaningfulness of the work of nursing played an important role in nurses' perceptions of their jobs. Work environment and work content were more strongly related to an intent to leave than external or individual factors. General satisfaction increased and intent to leave decreased as the patient environment became less complex. There were no differences in the study findings according to education, but job satisfaction was higher for nurses with more than ten years of experience and for those who were 50 years of age or older. Findings supported the utility of the JCM as a model of work motivation and satisfaction for nurses. The addition of specific attributes of support for autonomy, exchange of information, and inclusion of environmental complexity contributed to a fuller understanding of the factors in nursing related to motivation and satisfaction, and led to the development of a revised model of job characteristics for nursing.</description><creator>Edgar, Linda.</creator><contributor>Barnabe, C.

Metabolic inhibitors showed microbial nitrification to be the major NO source, regardless of the soil moisture content. Nitrification also produced N 2O, but denitrification losses of this gas from flooded, anaerobic soil were much higher. Up to 26% of nitrified N was converted to NO, but most of this (95%) was consumed microbially before it could escape across the soil surface. The NO-consuming process appeared to be co-oxidation by soil heterotrophs, not coupled to energy production. Organic matter content and CO2 production were therefore good predictors of NO oxidation rates across soil types, and NO oxidation was stimulated by manure addition. Soil water and nitrogen had nonlinear effects on trace gas fluxes, acting on both production and consumption. Kinetic analysis showed that nitrate was a weak noncompetitive inhibitor, but ammonium a strong competitive inhibitor of soil CH4 oxidation at field fertilization rates. However, spatial and temporal factors complicated fertilization effects on CH4 oxidation in situ. Ammonium was immobilized in surface soil and rapidly nitrified, limiting its inhibitory effect on CH 4 oxidation. Fertilizer N stimulated nitrification and denitrification and therefore gaseous N-oxide production, but other, unexpected fertilizer effects were also observed. Ammonium fertilizer decreased NO oxidation rates. Nitrate and other salts stimulated NO and N2O losses during nitrification, an effect apparently related to soil nitrite accumulation. The controls exerted on trace gas fluxes by soil water were mediated primarily through diffusion rates. Oxygen diffusion controlled the balance of anaerobic (methanogenesis and denitrification) versus aerobic (CH 4 oxidation and nitrification) processes. Soil moisture content also controlled the diffusion rate of atmospheric CH4 to soil methanotrophs, and the escape of gaseous N-oxides from production sites across the soil surface.</description><creator>Dunfield, Peter F.</creator><contributor>Knowles, Roger (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Nitric oxide.</subject><subject>Methane.</subject><subject>Histosols.</subject><subject>Nitrous oxide.</subject><title>Methane, nitrogen monoxide, and nitrous oxide fluxes in an organic soil</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cn69m5779.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hh63sx64p</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:08612q37n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A series of studies were conducted to evaluate genetic and phenotypic aspects of culling, herd life and survival in Quebec Holstein herds. Data consisted of lactation records obtained from the Programme d'Analyse des Troupeaux Laitiers du Quebec (PATLQ) files, which included 2.2 Million records before the editing procedures. The average productive herd life in Quebec herds was approximately 33 months, corresponding to an average replacement rate of MIND, for both milk recording options. Herds enrolled in the PATLQ official option had cows with longer calving intervals and culled their heifers earlier than herds in the owner sampler option. The probability of being culled for each major reason for disposal was assessed by logistic regression models, and it was shown that culling for low production (voluntary) had a clearly descending trend from 1981 to 1994, while involuntary culling (assumed to include all the reasons other than production) increased in importance mainly because of the ascending trends observed for cuffing due to reproductive problems, mastitis and feet and legs problems. Proportion of cows culled for involuntary reasons increased with parity number, but the opposite occurred for culling due to low production. Herds in the official option culled less for mastitis and sold more cows for dairy purposes than owner sampler herds. After these preliminary studies, a sequence of Weibull models were fitted to analyze different aspects of the data. The genetic study of herd life traits focused on differences between sires regarding true and functional herd life, but also described the effect of different explanatory variables on the failure time variable. Heritability for true and functional herd life was, respectively, 0.09 and 0.08 in the log scale and 0.19 and 0.15 in the original scale. The difference in the median survival time of daughters of bulls with extreme proofs for functional herd life was 1.7 lactations.

In order to further investigate the polymorphous dendritic growth, a recent phase-field model of dendritic growth due to Kobayashi [93] is modified by introducing a vectorial order parameter. This new model allows for the existence of grain boundaries and is used to study the amorphization of polycrystalline material as well as the growth of many dendrites of different orientations. One of the major techniques of solidification, namely the directional solidification is further analyzed by using the phase field model proposed by Grossmann et al. [93]. More precisely, a particular secondary instability, the vacillating breathing mode, is investigated. The relation between the frequency and the wavenumber, w~q , found in the experiment of Cladis et al. [91] is recovered through qualitative simulations. The effect of elasticity on growth is investigated. A model is proposed to explain the quasidendritic: growth of the Co islands deposited on a Pt(111) surface observed in a recent experiment of Grutter and Durig [95]. Qualitative resemblance between their experimental results and our simulations is found. The importance of dislocations is addressed by presenting a model of dislocation dynamics that takes into account the possibility of interfaces. This model not only incorporates the effect of dislocations on solidification, but also qualitatively reproduces some well known phenomena of dislocation theory known as "pile up".</description><creator>Aguenaou, Karim.</creator><contributor>Grant, Martin (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Engineering, Materials Science.</subject><subject>Physics, Condensed Matter.</subject><title>Modeling of solidification</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0p096889q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2b88qd84t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zg64tn714</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A thickness-shear mode (TSM) acoustic wave sensor system has been constructed and used to examine binding phenomena that occur in the liquid phase. The work is broadly divided into two sections. The first section examines the use of cholestyramine as a sensor coating for detection of bile acids. A 10-MHz piezoelectric crystal is coated on one side with cholestyramine resin and mounted in a batch-mode sensor block which exposes the coating to solution. After sample injection, the binding process is observed in real time as a drop in frequency as the bile salt binds to the coating, reaching &gt;90% completion within 10 minutes with most of the binding occurring within the first minute. Linear calibration curves are generated with sensitivity increasing in the order cholate ≈ glycocholate &lt; taurocholate &lt;&lt; taurodeoxycholate. Detection limits in water are in the range 0.2--9 nmol and are better than those observed in phosphate buffer. A multi-step regeneration protocol allows the coating to be reused more than 400 times over a period of several months. Precision for replicate injections is about 10% RSD and depends on the reproducibility of the regeneration and injection steps. In terms of the binding process, hydrophobic interactions are observed to be of importance in the ability of bile salts to displace other counterions. However, anions with greater charge density also appear to compete effectively for binding sites on the resin. In particular, at equimolar concentrations of citrate and bile salt, the trivalent citrate anion reduces the amount of bile salt binding by about 40%. This suggests that the efficiency of cholestyramine-based bile salt sequestering drugs used in the reduction of hypercholesterolemia may be improved by eliminating citric acid as an excipient and avoiding the use of fruit juices during ingestion. In the second section, a selection of compounds were examined for their potential as stable and reactive liquid-phase coatings with the primary amine group as the functional group of interest. Based on dry TSM sensor frequency changes, all coating candidates exhibited some degree of stable coating formation after incubation and rinsing. Reactivity of the coatings was then assessed via reaction with succinic anhydride under anhydrous conditions. With pyridine- and thiol-based coatings, the frequency change is negligible or is positive, which may indicate some loss of coating material upon reaction of the amine group. A silane-based coating was stable but exhibited only small frequency decreases for the reaction step. In terms of stability, reproducibility and magnitude of the frequency changes observed, poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) is seen to be the best choice for providing analytically useful signals where covalent reaction with surface-confined amino groups in the liquid phase is desired. Reaction of PEI with succinic anhydride also serves as a method for fabrication of sensor coatings with the carboxylic acid group as the reactive functional group of interest. The formation of reactive COOH groups was tested with a carbodiimide-activated covalent immobilization of dopamine. TSM sensor frequency changes, ellipsometry, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy provided support for all steps involved. The coating surface structure is uneven and is likely highly branched and three-dimensional. The method is quick and simple, and the films are also sufficiently robust for liquid-phase acoustic wave sensor applications.</description><creator>Chance, Jeffrey John.</creator><contributor>Purdy, William C.

Tools can affect the ability of the organization to deliver quality software systems; and they can affect software development cost and cycle-time. However, too frequently, the insertion of tools fails to yield the desired improvement. This constitutes a significant problem to software organizations because the adoption of a tool can incur considerable cost, and because the adoption of inappropriate tools can disrupt the development process. Predicting the impact of tool insertion has traditionally been difficult because one tool can have drastically different effects on different projects. Among the many factors that can affect the impact of tool insertion, two key factors are the development activities practiced in the process and the size of the adopting project. In order to improve the ability of software organizations to predict the impact of the insertion of tools on productivity, we have developed a method, called the Software Productivity Analysis Method (SPAM). The method helps in analyzing how the adoption of different technologies affects productivity in projects of different sizes when different development activities are used. To compare software productivity in different situations using SPAM, one must model the alternative activity sets, technologies and project sizes, using the specific modeling notation proposed here, and evaluate such models. A prototype tool has also been developed that supports the construction of such models and automates the analysis of software productivity in each case. To date, only a small number of methods have been proposed that facilitate the study of tool insertion impact. Arguably, SPAM is the first method that enables comparative analyses of software productivity with respect to technology, activities and project size. In order to validate the SPAM method it was used it in a case study in a large-scale industrial software development environment. The study revealed that there exists a complex interplay among the size of a software project, the technology and development activities employed in the project, and the productivity of software development. For instance, the study found that: (1) for a given tool, software productivity may peak at certain project sizes and drop down for both smaller and larger projects; (2) large projects with a relatively simple development process could lose productivity as a result of inserting a sophisticated tool; and (3) a software project that moves to a more rigorous process can regain much of the productivity losses entailed by inserting an appropriate tool. In the study, SPAM proved to be an effective vehicle for understanding the implications of tool insertion in a specific project. The method can help in making informed decisions on tool adoption by providing quantitative data on software productivity, development process, project size, and development technology.</description><creator>Bruckhaus, Tilmann.</creator><contributor>Madhavji, Nazim H.

PDLC's are formed by spinodal decomposition induced by thermal quenching or polymerization. These materials have excellent magneto-optical properties, and have great potential in applications that require efficient light scattering. Present commercial applications include switchable windows for privacy control and large-scale billboards. The optical properties depend on the droplet size, shape and positional order, which are determined during the formation stage, and reorientation dynamics of the liquid crystalline molecules confined within the droplets which occurs during product use. In this thesis, new complex mathematical models that describe the formation and performance of PDLC's are successfully developed, implemented, solved and validated. The nonequilibrium thermodynamic formation model takes into account initial thermal fluctuations computed using Monte Carlo simulations and realistic arbitrary boundary conditions. The performance model is based on classical nematic liquid crystalline magneto-viscoelastic theories, and incorporates transient viscoelastic boundary conditions. The simulations are able to reproduce successfully all the experimentally observed significant dynamical and morphological features of film formation as well as all the dynamical stages observed during the use of these thin optical films. In addition, the sensitivity of the phase separating morphology to processing conditions and material parameters is elucidated. Furthermore, a new scaling method is introduced to describe the phase separation phenomena during the early and intermediate stages of spinodal decomposition induced by thermal quenching.

In a study on incidental learning, alcohol enhanced neutral, positive and negative memory, possibly by a nonselective consolidation mechanism. Alcohol's enhancement of memory was found to not be associated (contingently related) with its incentive reward and relief effects. In another study on intentional learning, alcohol enhanced positive memory and/or inhibited negative memory, possibly reflecting a contingent relationship to its incentive effects. When the role of individual differences was examined, relatively little influence was found in mediating the effects of alcohol on incidental memory. However, alcohol's effect on intentional memory was predicted by individual differences in response to some of alcohol's acute incentive effects. The studies demonstrate that alcohol's effects on memory are independent from, and can be combined with, its incentive effects. Further, consumption of alcohol may be influenced by separate effects on memory and incentive, and by their association.</description><creator>Bruce, Kenneth R.</creator><contributor>Pihl, Robert O.

Both intercrop systems and water table controls alone have been shown to increase nitrogen (N) uptake and reduce soil NO$ sb3 sp-$-N accumulation in cropping systems. There is a need to maintain crop productivity while reducing the potential for soil NO$ sb3 sp-$-N leaching into groundwater. However, there has been no information available regarding agronomic and physiological aspects of N and water management for monocrop corn and corn competing with annual Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam) in an intercrop system. A study was conducted in southwestern Quebec during 1993 and 1994. Nitrogen and dry matter components in the plant-soil system were determined. Intercropped corn grain yield did not differ from monocropped corn under high N fertility. At harvest, the corn-annual ryegrass intercrop system increased total aboveground N uptake by 77.2 and 50.7 kg ha$ sp{-1}$ when compared with the corn monocrop system in 1993 and 1994, respectively. The intercrop system reduced the amount of NO$ sb3 sp-$-N in the top 1 m of soil by 47% (92.3 kg N ha$ sp{-1}$) at harvest in 1993. Water table controls had little effect on corn yield, N use efficiency and soil NO$ sb3 sp-$-N accumulation over the two years of this study. Both plant establishment and weather conditions affected the ability of annual ryegrass to aid in the uptake of soil NO$ sb3 sp-$-N. The reproductive development of water stressed plants after silking was limited more by overall plant changes due to water stress than assimilate supply. The delivery of C (sucrose) and N ($ sp{15}$N urea) into corn plants via stem-injection showed that externally supplied C changed both the source strength (photosynthetic inhibition) and sink strength (decreased total grain production), while distribution of $ sp{15}$N was affected by p</description><creator>Zhou, Xiaomin, 1962-</creator><contributor>Smith, D.

The insoluble PS block contents in the copolymers ranged from 80 to 98 wt. %. The aggregates were formed by the water addition to the copolymer solution in N,N-dimethylformamide, and then were isolated in aqueous solutions. Spherical micelles were formed when the PAA content in the copolymers was relatively higher. The PS core radii scaled as R$ sb{ rm core} sim$ N$ sb{ rm PS} sp{0.4}$ N$ sb{ rm PAA} sp{-0.15}$, where N$ sb{ rm PS}$ and N$ sb{ rm PAA}$ are the lengths of the PS and PAA blocks, respectively. The PAA corona shell dimensions were also studied. As the PAA content in block copolymers decreased, the morphology of the aggregate changed progressively from spheres to cylinders, to vesicles and lamellae, and eventually to compound micelles. The effects of the initial copolymer concentration and the addition of homopolystyrene on the aggregate morphology were also examined. The aggregate morphology appears to be controlled by a force balance mainly involving three aspects, i.e. the stretching of the PS chains in the core, the surface tension between the PS core and the solvent, and the inter-corona chain interactions. The aggregate morphology can be controlled by adding ions in micro-molar (HCl, NaOH, CaCl$ sb2$ or Ca(Ac)$ sb2$) or milli-molar (NaCl) concentrations. In addition to the various morphologies obtained by changing the copolymer composition, large compound vesicles, a new morphology, can be obtained from a single block copolymer. The morphogenic effect of different added ions on the crew-cut aggregates can be ascribed to the changed inter-corona chain repulsive interactions, due to neutralization, protonation, ion-binding, and screened electrostatic field, etc. The range of morphologies obtained in this study is believed to be unprecedented for a block copolymer self-assembly system in low molecular weight solvents.</description><creator>Zhang, Lifeng.</creator><contributor>Eisenberg, Adi (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Chemistry, Polymer.</subject><title>Crew-cut aggregates of polystyrene-b-poly (acrylic acid) diblock copolymers in solutions</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xk81jn26w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tm70mx22h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kw52j969q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Quasi-two-dimensional turbulent flows were produced in a tank of small thickness to study confinement and friction effects on large-scale turbulent motion of small depth. The tank was constructed of two parallel walls. The space between the walls (4.4 cm, 1.57 cm and 0.59 cm) was small compared with the height (108 cm) and the width (210 cm) of the tank, and was varied during the experiments for different confinement and friction effects. Two series of experiments were conducted. In the first series turbulent flows were produced by the injection of water in the form of shallow jets into the tank filled with water of the same density. In the second series turbulent flows in the form of shallow plumes were produced by releasing saline solution from a line source, located at the top of the tank, into the tank filled with water. Dye was injected with the source fluid as the tracer. The concentration of the dye in the shallow turbulent flows was determined using a video imaging technique. From the initiation of the turbulent motion at the source to the final interaction of the jets and the plumes with the tank, the entire sequence of events was recorded by a video camera. The unsteady turbulent motions were analyzed using the recorded video images. The large-scale turbulent flow in the small space between the walls of the tank is confined to essentially two-dimensional motion, and the motion is retarded by the force of friction. The confinement effect was evaluated from the data of the shallow plume experiments, as the friction effect is neglible compared with the buoyancy effect in the case of the plume. Friction, however, is significant in the case of the jet. The effect of the friction, evaluated from the data of the shallow jet experiments, was found to have a profound effect on the entrainment processes. These findings are useful for turbulent modelling of the shallow shear flow and on its application to the large scale heat and mass exchange processes in the atm</description><creator>Zhang, Jian-Bo.</creator><contributor>Chu, V.

First concentrating on relativistic heavy ion collisions slightly below the GeV/nucleon range, we perform studies of the equation of state (EOS) for nuclear matter. The non-equilibrium aspects of such collisions are simulated by the Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model with a momentum-dependent nuclear mean field. The EOS effects on the collective flow observables and dielectron spectra have been systematically and quantitatively examined by comparing with the experimental data gathered by the DIOGENE, Streamer Chamber, Plastic Ball, EOS TPC, E848H and DLS collaborations. The importance of the precise functional dependence of the nuclear mean field on the particle momentum, and the compressibility coefficient K of the nuclear matter are addressed. Using a simple coalescence model, we show that a quantitative connection between the composite flow and K can be established. In such nucleus-nucleus collisions, we also consider and discuss lepton pair production mechanisms. These include nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung, $ Delta$ decay, $ eta$ decay, and pion-pion annihilation. We then turn to lepton pair production in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. We concentrate on pion-pion virtual bremsstrahlung in the soft limit M $&lt;$ 300 MeV, and we make a quantitative comparison of various soft-photon-approximation (SPA) formulae with a full one-boson-exchange (OBE) calculation.</description><creator>Zhang, Jianming, 1966-</creator><contributor>Gale, Charles (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Physics, Nuclear.</subject><title>Investigation of the nuclear equation of state and dielectron production in heavy ion collisions</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k643b283q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fj236387p</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2b88qd853</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Sampling methods used for the assessment of exposure to volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) in the workplace or for environmental studies are now limited to an upper integrative sampling time of 24 hours or less. Generally, these methods lack versatility and are difficult to use. A passive sampler that can extend sampling periods was developed as part of this research. This novel sampler relies on capillary tubes to restrict and control ambient air entry into an evacuated sample container. A mathematical model was derived by modifications to the Hagen-Poiseuille and ideal gas laws. This model defines the relationship between container volume and capillary geometry (length/internal diameter) required to provide selected sampling times. Based on theoretical considerations, simulations were performed to study the effects of dimensional parameters. From these results, capillaries having 0.05 and 0.10 mm internal diameters were selected according to their ability to reduce sampling flow rates and to increase sampling times. Different capillary lengths were tested on various sampler prototypes. It was found that a constant sampling flow rate was delivered when a maximum discharge rate was established under the influence of a pressure gradient between a vacuum and ambient pressure. Experimental flow rates from 0.018 to 2.6 ml/min were obtained and compared with model predictions. From this comparison, empirical relationships between capillary geometry and maximum discharge rate given by the pressure gradient were defined. Essentially, based on these empirical relationships, capillary sampling flow controller specifications can be calculated to offer extended integrated sampling periods. On this basis, sampler prototypes were configured for stationary sampling and personal sampling. Studies, based on theory, have indicated that factors such as temperature, humidity and longitudinal molecular diffusion are not likely to influence the passive sampling process. Subsequent experiments confirmed that temperature changes should not significantly affect flow rates delivered by controllers, and that molecular diffusion does not have any impact on the representativeness of long-term samples. Recovery tests provided acceptable results demonstrating that selected capillaries do not contribute to adsorption that could seriously affect the validity of this sampling approach. Field demonstration studies were performed with both stationary and personal sampler prototypes in the indoor and outdoor environments. The performance of the sampler compared favorably, and in some instances, exceeded that of accepted methodology. These novel samplers were more reliable, had greater versatility and principally, allowed sampling periods extending from hours to a month. These inherent qualities will assist industrial hygienists and environmentalists in the study of emission sources, pollutant concentrations, dispersion, migration and control measures. This novel sampler is presently the only device available for the effective study of episodic events of VOC emission. Selected capillary geometries acting as a restriction to the entry of ambient air into evacuated sample container can provide a simple, versatile and reliable alternative for the collection of VOCs. This approach can contribute to a better understanding of VOC effects on human health and the environment.</description><creator>Simon, Philippe, 1964-</creator><contributor>Farant, Jean-Pierre (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Environmental Sciences.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Occupational Health and Safety.</subject><title>Long-term integrated sampling to characterize airborne volatile organic compounds in indoor and outdoor environments</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tq57ns65m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2b88qd853</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Occupational Health</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):35175</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
