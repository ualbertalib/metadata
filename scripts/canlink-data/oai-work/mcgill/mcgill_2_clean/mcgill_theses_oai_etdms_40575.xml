To evaluate access to dental care for individuals with Down syndrome living with their families, as compared to those not living with families. Methods. A cross-sectional, observational study design was used. Data were collected through a questionnaire sent to the 2327 members of the Canadian Down Syndrome Society. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to investigate the association between place of residence and a variety of indicators of access to dental care. Result. In the multivariate stage of analysis, after adjusting for possible confounders, significant association between place of residence and two dependent variables, indicated that individuals with DS living with their families had approximately twice the odds for ever had a filling, (95% CI, 1.0-3.8), and they had approximately one third odds for ever had extractions, compared to individuals with DS living elsewhere (95% CI, 0.1-0.7). Conclusion. These observations suggest that Canadians with DS living at home receiving different dental care compared to those living elsewhere.</description><creator>Taherinejad, Farahnaz.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Health Sciences, Dentistry.</subject><subject>Sociology, Individual and Family Studies.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Mental Health.</subject><title>Access to dental care in individuals with Down Syndrome living with their families compared to those not living with their families</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Farahnaz Taherinejad, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0k225b29j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/79407x508</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Dentistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cn69m439p</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:04:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The expression of the Nogo-66 receptor (NgR) on different types of endothelial cells was a novel observation alleged by Dr. Bar-Or A. and Dr. Fournier AE (personal communication, April 2004). It was hypothesised that the activation of NgR on endothelial cells could cause an increase in barrier permeability by actin reorganization and tight junction alteration. To verify this hypothesis, primary cultures of human brain endothelial cells (HBECs) as well as the human endothelial cell line EA.hy 926 were exposed to the NgR binding domain of Nogo-A (Nogo-66 peptide). This research demonstrates that endothelial cells are unresponsive to Nogo-66 stimulation. Furthermore and most importantly, the protein expression of NgR in endothelial cells was revisited and it is shown that, contrary to previous beliefs, NgR is absent from HBECs and EA.hy 926. In addition to this new perspective about NgR expression on endothelial cells, this research has yielded potentially relevant data about the effect of bovine serum on tight junction maturation.</description><creator>Simard, Marie-Lune.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><subject>Biology, Physiology.</subject><title>The role of Nogo-66 receptor as a potential modulator of endothelial barrier function /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Marie-Lune Simard, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4f16c307d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cn69m439p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2r36tx772</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:04:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Let (M, g) be a closed n-dimensional Riemannian manifold with metric g and Laplace-Beltrami operator Delta.

Sixty-four patients from the hemodialysis unit at Renfrew Victoria Hospital in Renfrew, Ontario, and a satellite unit at St. Francis Memorial Hospital in Barry's Bay, Ontario, were assessed using the Social Work Patient Profile, Perceived Quality of Life and Compliance Indices. Bivariate correlation and multiple regressions were conducted on psychosocial, physical and mental health variables to determine if they correlated, and could be predictors of, social worker and nurses' perceptions of patients' quality of life and compliance. Findings support multiple correlations between variables. Younger age, recreation, family support, self driving to dialysis, dementia, diabetes as the cause of chronic kidney failure (CKF), and other as the cause of CKF were significant individual predictors of social work quality of life score. Significant individual predictors for the nurses' quality of life scores were dementia, glomeruloneph, compliance, level of education, and polycystic kidney disease as the cause of CKF. The statistically significant risk factors for nurses' quality of life were lower levels of education and dementia. The four psychosocial variables that predicted compliance to treatment, suggested that there was increased compliance for patients who had recreation and family support, and increased risk factors with age and lower levels of education.</description><creator>Riopelle, Donna Michele.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Quality of life.</subject><subject>Hemodialysis -- Patients.</subject><title>Hemodialysis patients' psychosocial characteristics and quality of life indicators</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Donna Michele Riopelle, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1g05fb89d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ng451h816</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gt54kn398</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:04:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this study was to examine the links between child maltreatment and animal abuse, how these two forms of maltreatment often occur simultaneously within a family and how the existence of one maltreatment type should alert professionals to the potential for other types of harm. File reviews were completed at both Family and Children's Services of Renfrew County (FCS) and the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (OSPCA), Renfrew County Branch. Data were collected on relevant variables, including maltreatment type, removal and return of children/animals, legal involvement and risk ratings. A total of 188 common files were found, representing almost 25% of OSPCA cases in a 6-year period; 48% of these cases were open at both agencies at the same time. When the files for the two agencies were merged, several statistically significant correlations were found, including: correlations between physical harm to pets and domestic violence for FCS clients; between Criminal Code charges for FCS clients and police involvement for OSPCA clients; and between removals of children from families involved with FCS and neglect of pets. These findings suggest that there is a need for cross-training and cross-reporting between child protection and animal welfare sectors to ensure better protection of both children and animals.</description><creator>Walker, Marjorie.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Child abuse -- Ontario.</subject><subject>Animal welfare -- Ontario.</subject><title>Kids and critters : links between child maltreatment and animal abuse</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Marjorie Walker, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m326m195q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gt54kn398</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rr171x52v</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:04:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study examined the relationship between residential environment and subjective quality of life (QOL) for individuals with mental illness. Demographic variables impacting QOL were also examined. The Wisconsin Quality of Life Index---Canadian Version (CaW QLI, Diaz &amp; Mercier, 1996) was administered to a total of 46 participants and was used to assess the QOL of individuals living in a supported residential environment as compared to individuals living in other types of environments. The major findings were: (1) psychiatric consumers/survivors in the supported residential environment reported higher QOL scores in 4 of the 9 domains examined; (2) residents living in a supported housing facility were more likely to be involved in a greater number of daily activities; (3) education was strongly correlated with 4 of the 9 QOL domains; (4) regression analyses however showed that residential environment or demographic variables on their own did not have a significant effect on QOL.

It was a three month, arts-based, targeted prevention program run in an already existing drop-in centre for delinquent youth. This article reports on the qualitative findings of in-depth interviews conducted with the key stakeholders: participating adolescents (aged 14-19 years), lead artists, research assistants, and site directors. Findings suggest that the art curriculum, the strong relationships built, and the gains made were all strengths of the program. These gains include the acquisition of art skills, social skills and an improved ability to problem solve. Findings from this study also suggest the need for future research, including outcome studies and a program evaluation.</description><creator>Spinner, David.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Problem youth -- Behavior modification -- Alberta -- Edmonton.</subject><subject>Art therapy.</subject><subject>Juvenile delinquents -- Alberta -- Edmonton.</subject><title>The Edmonton arts and youth feasibility study : a qualitative look at running an arts education program for youth in conflict with the law</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© David Spinner, 2005</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s7526c62c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3x816m850</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pk02cb089</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:04:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The following thesis describes and analyzes the development of the U.S. slot allocation system from 1968 until today, in order to draw relevant conclusions for a new European Slot Regulation. The European Commission is currently drafting a new Slot Regulation purporting to introduce market mechanisms. A similar approach was espoused in the United States from 1986 onward, but was ultimately supplanted by overriding legislation in 2000. The analysis of the U.S. slot allocation system reveals the reasons underlying its abolition and queries whether this experience can be successfully transposed in Europe. The thesis commences by providing general information on the definition of slots, slot allocation, and airport capacity. A brief review of the European Commission's current consultation process on the implementation of market mechanisms for slot allocation follows. The main part of the thesis discusses the U.S. High Density Rule and the Rules for the Allocation and Transfer of High Density Airport Slots in historical order. Some criticisms frequently voiced assert that the Rules artificially limited access to airports, constituted barriers to market entry, restricted airline competition, generated higher fares, and yielded adverse effects on smaller communities which, in turn, lost access to key markets. Through a favorable assessment of the Rules, the thesis analyses these concerns and concludes that the suppression of the Rules was rather prompted by local political motivations than by other rationalities. However, experiences drawn from the U.S. Rules demonstrate that a future European secondary market for slots, if implemented under a grand fathering system, will likely have a positive impact on the efficiency of airport capacity, but not on access to the market and competition.</description><creator>Moessner, Philipp.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Airport slot allocation -- Law and legislation -- European Union countries.</subject><subject>Airport slot allocation -- Law and legislation -- United States.</subject><title>Slot allocation in the United States and Europe</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Philipp Moessner, 2005</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pk02cb09k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pk02cb089</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:b8515n64w</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:04:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis discusses the background, contents and airpolitical consequences of the so-called 'Horizontal Agreements ("HA"),' concluded by the European Union ("EU") with third countries to give effect to the European Court of Justice's ("Court"/"ECJ") decision of November 2002 in the 'Open Skies' cases brought by the European Commission ("EC"/"Commission") against certain EU Member States. The Court's decision outlaws the nationality or 'ownership and control' clause in the bilateral ('Open Skies') agreements concluded with the United States by those Member States. As this clause is a standard provision in all bilateral air services agreements, the Court's decision actually obliges the Member States to amend those agreements and replace the said clauses by provisions which do not discriminate on the basis of nationality. The Member States have in the meantime mandated the Commission to engage in such negotiations on their behalf on the basis of a jointly developed Model Horizontal Agreement ("MHA"), containing a non-discriminatory so-called Community clause and some other provisions on matters within the exclusive competence of the Community. This research thus examines the legal and airpolitical implications of these Horizontal Agreements, which the Commission has concluded in the meantime and continues to propose to third countries. In this connection, attention is given to the scenario of the anticipated Horizontal Agreement negotiations between the EU and the Republic of Korea.</description><creator>Oh, Julianne Sang-Eun.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Aeronautics, Commercial -- Law and legislation -- European Union countries.</subject><subject>Aeronautics, Commercial -- International cooperation.</subject><subject>Aeronautics, Commercial -- Law and legislation -- Korea.</subject><subject>Airlines -- Deregulation -- European Union countries.</subject><title>The EU 'Horizontal Agreements' : background and consequences of an airpolitical novum</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Julianne Sang-Eun Oh, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sb397860b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b8515n64w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h989r339t</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:04:14Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Liberalising trade is not limited to diminishing trade barriers or decreasing tariffs rates, but also ensuring that these efforts are maintained: this is the role of competition rules. It is common knowledge that for decades Countries have been trying to agree on international harmonised competition rules. Aware of this interaction between trade and competition policies, they knew efforts had to be undertaken to make them co-exist. Unfortunately the dream never came true. And parties only inherited rules of competition hardly recognised, or implicitly applied within the International Trade Law Framework. Even if some implicit rules of competition have been 'injected' in some of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade provisions in the early 1950's, it is only the new 1994 World Trade Organisation Agreements that have consecrated this orientation, drafted so to discipline the Parties as for competition-related behaviour; even if by definition WTO Agreements were not competition agreements. Far from the debate of their potential harmonisation, the thesis identifies these rules, analyses their evolution within time and their very application through the study of WTO cases. It will establish that the emergence of a competition jurisprudence is an undeniable reality.</description><creator>Malek-Bakouche, Farah.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Competition, Unfair.</subject><subject>World Trade Organization.</subject><subject>Antitrust law (International law)</subject><title>Competition law and international trade from the GATT to the WTO : the undeniable reality of an emergent jurisprudence</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Farah Malek-Bakouche, 2005</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qj72p7427.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h989r339t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kp78gg64n</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:04:14Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Seventy-five years ago the provincial governments of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta signed a series of Natural Resources Transfer Agreements (NRTAs) with the federal government. These agreements provided the answer to a contentious debate known as the 'Natural Resources Question'. Before the NRTAs, the three prairie provinces did not have control over their public domain lands and did not share equal constitutional status with the other Canadian provinces. In the early 1920s, Prime Minister King recognized the validity of the provincial arguments for constitutional equality and no longer wanted the federal government to be responsible for the administration of provincial natural resources. By this time, the policy ambitions which had previously justified the retention of the natural resources had been fulfilled. Thus, the constitutional rights arguments presented by the prairie provinces found a receptive audience when the control of the lands and resources were no longer a federal priority.</description><creator>O'Byrne, Nicole Colleen.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Natural resources -- Law and legislation -- Canada.</subject><subject>Constitutional law -- Canada.</subject><subject>Constitutional history -- Canada.</subject><title>The answer to the 'Natural Resources Question' : a historical analysis of the Natural Resources Transfer Agreements</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Nicole Colleen O'Byrne, 2005</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/12579s459.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kp78gg64n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9g54xh933</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:04:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Experiments were conducted to study oscillation and friction effects on the mass exchange between the recirculating flow in a square basin and the main flow in an open channel. During the experiments, a turbulent mixing layer was observed to form between the recirculating flow in the basin and the main flow. Dye was introduced into the turbulent mixing layer as a tracer to observe the motion of the eddies. The concentration of the dye was measured using a video imaging method. The data were analysed for an early period shortly after the dye entered the basin, and a late period when the dye in the basin had reached a quasi-steady state. Parameters such as retention time, accumulation time and arrival time were estimated using the time series of the concentration in the core of the basin and in the region outside of the core. The circulation time and circulation flow rate were computed using the area occupied by the dye. The rate of increase in the area was equated to the circulation flow rate. The mean and root-mean-square dye-concentration profiles were obtained for a number of cross sections along the mixing layer. The flow in the mixing layer was observed to oscillate due to feedback from the impingement of the mixing layer on the downstream corner of the basin. The oscillation frequencies were determined by spectral analysis of the concentration data at a location in the mixing layer near the point of the impingement. Tests were conducted for a range of Froude number varying from Fr = 0.09 to 0.47 and a range of bed-friction number from S = 0.023 to 0.27. Self-sustaining oscillations of the type known as "fluid-resonant feedback" were observed in the mixing layer. The onset of the oscillations in the mixing layer was detected to occur for a Froude number greater than 0.28. However, the mixing layer was not responsive to the feedback when the Froude number was less than 0.28. The dimensionless frequency of the oscillation was correlated with the Froude number. The Strouhal and Froude number relation analogously was consistent with the Rossiter's formula, which was developed for cavity oscillations in compressible flow. Beside the flow oscillations, the mixing layer and the recirculating flow in the basin were affected by the friction effect. Friction slow down the circulation in the basin. It changes the turbulence in the mixing layer. These effects of the friction were only significant when the water depth is sufficiently shallow. The dimensionless parameter for the friction effects was the bed-friction number. The demarcation of the flow between the deep and the shallow was found to occur at a bed-friction number S ≃ 0.09. The friction effect was negligible when the bed-friction number is less than the critical value of 0.09.</description><creator>Pinilla, Camilo Ernesto.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Oscillation and friction effects on mass exchange in a recirculating flow</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Camilo Ernesto Pinilla, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nz806004j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9g54xh933</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ht24wj69n</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:04:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis investigates the interactions between alkyl ketene dimer (AKD) and precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC). Although the mechanisms behind AKD sizing and reactions with cellulose have been studied in-depth, methods describing AKD retention are poorly understood. The aim of this research was to determine the conditions and time-scale under which AKD and PCC heteroflocculate, and to determine the influence of PCC on non-retained AKD. We also wanted to understand the mechanisms behind AKD interactions with cPAM, and perform experiments on the twin-wire sheet former. We outline a procedure for creating an AKD emulsion coated by cationic starch and free of extraneous substances. We find that AKD and PCC each homoflocculate, but no heteroflocculation occurs between the two chemicals. This suggests that PCC and AKD do not directly interact. Instead, starch removal from the AKD particle surface aids the homoflocculation of PCC (via polymer bridging). This indicates that the alkaline environment is the most significant factor contributing to AKD hydrolysis. More importantly, we find that AKD and PCC are not likely to interact in the whitewater cycle. This refutes the general idea that PCC lowers AKD retention. Adsorption kinetic experiments revealed that although cationic AKD and cPAM do not flocculate, cPAM does increase the retention of AKD by assisting its deposition onto fibers. Asymmetrical polymer bridging explains both the increase in AKD retention and the behavior of AKD flocculation kinetics with cPAM. Although the initial kinetics are nearly independent of cPAM dosage, excess cPAM delays the achievement of maximum possible AKD retention due to starch and cPAM re-conformation. Lastly, it was found that the addition of cPAM results in an increase in the bond strength between AKD and fibers, thereby eliminating AKD detachment. Studies on the twin-wire sheet former found that cPAM increases the first-pass retention of AKD three-fold. The twin-wire former was proven to be a useful tool for studying AKD retention.</description><creator>Poraj-Kozminski, Agatha.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Alkyl ketene dimer and precipitated calcium carbonate interactions in wet-end papermaking</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Agatha Poraj-Kozminski, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hd76s040t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ht24wj69n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hm50tr95h</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:04:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Tethers have been used in space for quite some time. However, the concept of a multi-tethered system has received less attention. This thesis investigates the dynamics of certain configurations of multi-tethered satellite formations in Low Earth Orbits. Certain simplifications have been made prior to the investigation of the problem; these include considering the satellites to be point-masses and the tethers to be massless and straight. Configurations termed hub-and-spoke and closed-hub-and-spoke are analyzed. The local motion is studied under two distinct specifications for the orbital motion of the system: first, prescribed motion of the system centre of mass and second, prescribed motion of the central body of the formation. Three-dimensional motion is studied for formations lying in the orbital plane and in the Earth-facing plane normal to the orbit, while given an initial spin rate in their nominal plane. Later, two satellite formations deployed along the local vertical are examined: a closed-hub-and-spoke configuration with its spin axis along the long axis of symmetry, which is found to be unstable, and a double-pyramid configuration, which is found to be stable.</description><creator>Pizarro-Chong, Ary Druva.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Engineering, Aerospace.</subject><title>Dynamics of multi-tethered satellite formations</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Ary Druva Pizarro-Chong, 2005</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jd472w730.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hm50tr95h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vm40xr869</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:04:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis presents low-rate personal area network coordinator design and implementation on both hardware and software fronts.

The fact that such contaminants have been detected in surface waters at potentially detrimental levels indicates that conventional treatment plants are unable to effectively remove them; hence, supplementary treatment technologies must be considered. As one of these, enzymatic treatment offers numerous advantages which make such a treatment methodology almost tailor-made for the selective removal of such contaminants. In order to evaluate the potential for enzymatic treatment to be used to target important estrogenic compounds, the enzyme-catalysed oxidation of selected potent estrogens including estradiol, estriol and ethinylestradiol was studied. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme was selected as the candidate enzyme since it is amongst the most studied oxidative enzymes and has been investigated extensively in waste treatment applications. Experiments were conducted at concentrations higher than those found in typical effluents in order to characterize the reactivity of the enzymes toward these compounds without being hampered by analytical difficulties. In order to gauge the importance/relevance of the data obtained for the enzymatic oxidation of estrogens parallel experiments were also conducted with phenol, which has been the subject of many past studies as a substrate of HRP and for which the technical feasibility of enzymatic treatment has been well established. HRP was able to effectively catalyse the oxidation of estrogens over a wide range of pHs, with optimal performance in the pH range typically experienced in wastewaters. Measurements of the stoichiometry of the reaction between estrogens and peroxide and also the enzyme dose required to achieve certain target levels of substrate removal suggested that the enzymatic oxidation of estrogens consistently had lower peroxide and enzyme requirements than phenol. In fact, phenol required between 2.5 and 5 times more enzyme than the estrogens to achieve various target levels of removal. For all substrates studied, similar kinetics of removal were found, provided that sufficient enzyme was added to reactions to compensate for differences in substrate affinity. In contrast to earlier studies conducted with HRP, minimal inactivation of the enzyme was observed during the treatment of all substrates. The lesser inactivation observed in the present study was probably due to the very low concentration of target substrates used. Collectively, the results indicate that the removal of estrogens is likely to be more feasible than phenol itself. It is also suggested that since the estrogen concentrations utilized here were an order of magnitude higher than environmentally-relevant concentrations and since the enzyme dose required and the level of inactivation observed are directly related to the amount of substrate targeted for treatment, the feasibility of removing estrogens may be more favourable at environmentally relevant values, except where kinetic limitations may dominate.</description><creator>Khan, Usman, 1980-</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Engineering, Civil.</subject><title>Peroxidase-catalysed oxidation of natural and synthetic hormones</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Usman Khan, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kh04dp966.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rv042t409</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9k41zd79h</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:04:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Detonation waves in gaseous reactive mixtures have been known to exhibit multidimensional structure since the 1950's. The interaction of shocks and presence of unsteady triple shock interactions in the detonation structure give rise to the detonation cell, the size of which is determined by the reactive mixture and initial conditions. Detonable gaseous mixtures have been classified as regular or irregular, depending on their behavior in particular experimental conditions. The main combustion mechanisms in the structure of irregular mixtures have not yet been positively identified. The structure of detonation waves in an irregular mixture of stoichiometric methane and oxygen is observed using non-intrusive visual diagnostics. Framing schlieren, streak schlieren and framing self-luminous imaging were used, yielding, respectively, an instantaneous measure of the density gradient, a time evolution of the density gradients and a record of the regions of high luminosity. Regions of high luminosity correspond qualitatively to regions of high chemical reaction. Pockets of high density gas were observed behind the lead shock surface. Light emission was observed, using framing self-luminous imaging, at the edges of these pockets indicating the pockets burned primarily at the edges. The amount of mass burned in one such pocket was found to be 40% of the total mass burned in one cell cycle. The induction time of a particle undergoing shock compression was calculated. The cases of constant properties behind the shock and of a decaying blast followed by expansion waves were considered as characteristic induction times of shock-induced combustion. Both measures of induction time were found to be longer than the typical time scale of a particle burning in one of the observed pockets. Furthermore, the coincidence of light emission with the edges of the pocket of unburned gas and the long time scales involved indicate the burning mechanism of this unburned pocket to be turbulent diffusion rather than shock compression.</description><creator>Kiyanda, Charles Basenga.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Photographic study of the structure of irregular detonation waves</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Charles Basenga Kiyanda, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ht24wj70d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9k41zd79h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p5547r68h</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:04:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In recent years, new and novel forms of computation employing different natural phenomena such as the spin of atoms or the orientation of protein molecules have been proposed and are in the very initial stages of development. One of the most promising of these new computation techniques is quantum computing that employs various physical effects observed at the quantum level to provide significant improvement in certain computation tasks such as data search and factorization. An assortment of software-based simulators of quantum computers have been developed recently to assist in the development of this new computation process. However, efficiently simulating quantum algorithms at the software level is quite challenging since the algorithms have exponential run-times and memory requirements. Furthermore, the sequential nature of software-based computation makes simulating the parallel nature of quantum computation exceedingly difficult. In this thesis, the first hardware-based quantum algorithm emulation technique is presented. The emulator uses FPGA technology to model quantum circuits. Parallel computation available at the hardware level allows considerable speed-up as compared to the state-of-the-art software simulators as well as provides a greater insight into precision requirements for simulating quantum circuits.</description><creator>Khalid, Ahmed Usman.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>FPGA emulation of quantum circuits</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Ahmed Usman Khalid, 2005</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6m311p64r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p5547r68h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wd375w46v</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:04:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The goal of this research is to explore the control of a robotic arm in a visually guided reaching operation. Considering the role of the superior colliculus and the spinal cord in human arm movements, this study proposes simple approaches for the control of arm reaching. An efficient use of distance error signals between actual and desired end-point positions leads to reaching trajectories in two dimensions that are very similar to more traditional kinematic strategies. This implies that the nature of the premotor signal in the spinal cord may be related to simple error signals rather than trajectories. The main conclusions to be stated from this work have two implications. First that a very simple biomimetic strategy can be used to control a robotic arm, and produces trajectories very similar to those seen in human reaching. Second, the hardware tests act as indirect proof that many concepts in biological motor control need to be revisited. For example, the need for complex kinematic computations is now de-emphasized.</description><creator>Khachani, Mehdi.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Engineering, Robotics.</subject><subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</subject><title>Design of a two dimensional biomimetic controller for a two-link robotic arm</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Mehdi Khachani, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wp988k10f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wd375w46v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biomedical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6q182k41z</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:04:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Electromagnetic band-gap (EBG) structures, often termed frequency selective surfaces (FSSs) or photonic band-gap (PBG) materials, have found widespread applications as filters for microwaves and optical signals. Due to their frequency selective features and ease of implementation in printed circuit board (PCB) technology, EBG structures are utilized in power distribution networks (PDNs) to induce wide stopband and to provide global power/ground noise suppression. Attenuation characteristic of EBG structures within their forbidden frequency regions is examined in this thesis which ultimately provides the insertion loss obtained by inserting the EBG structure in the PDN. Bandgap characterization is efficiently achieved by applying the Bloch analysis to only one unit-cell of the EBG structure. For that purpose, two approaches have been investigated: the transmission-line (TL) technique and the finite element method (FEM). Printed-circuit EBG structures can be efficiently modeled by transmission-line circuits; thus TL techniques are widely used for their fast characterization. The developed TL model is exploited to investigate the power attenuation within the band-gap regions of PDNs containing EBG structures. A full-wave finite element code has been developed for accurate prediction of the stopband characteristics of periodic media. A number of simple periodic geometries are examined by the finite element code showing unique spectral properties of EBG structures, such as existence of evanescent and/or complex modes within their stopbands.</description><creator>Tavallaee, Amir Ali.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>On the stopband characterization of periodic structures</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Amir Ali Tavallaee, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1c18dg02h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6q182k41z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sx61dm57b</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:04:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The work reported in this thesis is motivated by the need for new screening techniques for detecting early-stage breast tumors. In recent years, pulsed microwave imaging in the gigahertz range has been suggested as a promising complementing methodology to the currently existing detection and imaging modalities. This technique is based on significant electrical contrast between the cancerous and healthy breast tissue in the microwave range. To exploit this electrical contrast for imaging purposes, a broadband trans-receiving antenna is placed near the breast surface. The antenna launches a pulse and then collects the backscattered response, used for detection of the potentially underlying tumor. In our work, we examine tumor detection capabilities of the "Dark Eyes" antenna, recently reported in the literature and suggested as antenna of choice for pulsed microwave breast imaging due to its compact size, ease of fabrication and cost-effectiveness.

Traditionally, human experts locate lesions, which are diseased tissue, on magnetic resonance images (MRI). However, manual classification methods are particularly subjective, as experts locate lesions differently, particularly around the borders of these structures. The proposed approach classifies voxels from MRIs into regular tissue and lesions, thus allowing for an objective and consistent way to locate lesions in order to help track their size and count. Previous automatic classification approaches do not model the variation of the MRI tissue intensities in the brain, so as to accurately locate lesions in the posterior fossa, where the intensities vary significantly from the rest of the brain. To this end, the posterior probability distribution is used to determine MRI voxel labels for background, cerebrospinal fluid, grey matter, white matter, as well as labels for two lesion types which differ due to their appearance on MRIs: T1-hypointense lesions (also called black holes) and T2-hyperintense lesions excluding black holes. Furthermore, the proposed method provides neuropathology experts with a confidence level in the classification, which has not been provided in previous work. Spatial variability in intensity distributions over the brain is explicitly modeled by (1) segmenting the brain into distinct anatomical regions, (2) building the likelihood distributions of each tissue class in each region and (3) modeling each distribution as a multidimensional Gaussian using intensities from multimodal MRIs. Local smoothness is enforced by incorporating Markov random fields in the prior probability and thus taking into account neighboring voxel tissue classes. Qualitative and quantitative validation is performed for both lesion classes on real data from 10 patients with multiple sclerosis. Validation on ten patients for both lesion types has not been performed by previous works. Lesion classification results are compared to classifications performed by several experts and two other automatic classification techniques, using volume count and overlap. Automatic classification results are comparable to manual classifications, thus providing a more consistent and time effective alternative to manual classification. In addition, the proposed method has the advantage of providing a more accurate classification in the posterior fossa, which is a region of the brain that is difficult to classify, and where no other automatic method reports success.</description><creator>Harmouche, Rola.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Bayesian multiple sclerosis lesion classification modeling regional and local spatial information</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Rola Harmouche, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vd66w008t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1j92g777t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g732d920z</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:04:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Block copolymers are known to micro-phase separate into different ordered structures such as lamellae, spheres and cylinders. Such morphologies can be used to template nano-porous materials for membranes and catalyst supports by selective etching of one of the blocks after ordering of the block copolymers. This thesis focuses on the synthesis of polymers that can be used to template nano-porous materials. Poly(styrene)-b-poly(lactide) diblock copolymers and poly(lactide)-b-poIy(styrene)-b-poly(t-butyl styrene) triblock copolymers were synthesized using nitroxide mediated polymerization (NMP) and ring opening polymerization (ROP). Poly(styrene)-b-poly(lactide) polymers were made using a commercially available hydroxyl terminated polystyrene and reacting it with triethylaluminum to form a macroinitiator for ROP. This macroinitiator was then reacted with d,l-lactide to form a poly(styrene)-b-poly(lactide) diblock. These diblocks were then partially sulfonated (~35%) to impart anionic functional groups on the pore walls after selective etching of the poly(lactide) block. NMP was done with a hydroxyl functional initiator (Vazo-86) to produce a hydroxyl terminated poly(styrene) which was subsequently used as a macro-initiator to perform ROP of lactide catalyzed by triethylaluminum. The kinetics and "livingess" of NMP with this initiator was also studied. Oligomers of hydroxyl terminated poly(styrene) (weight average molecular weight = Mw =1.5 kg/mole) were used to make diblocks consisting of poly(styrene) and poly(lactide) by ROP and these were then used as macroinitiators for NMP to synthesize triblocks consisting of poly(t-butyl styrene), poly(styrene) and poly(lactide). Molecular weight distributions were narrow (Mw/Mn &lt; 1.3) (where Mn is the number average molecular weight) and careful purification of the macroinitiator was necessary for effective ROP. After alignment by reciprocating shear and degradation of poly(lactide), the diblocks and triblocks are ready for testing for ion exchange capacity.</description><creator>Graffe, Andres.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Syntheses and characterization of diblock and triblock copolymers that can be used as templates for nanoporous materials</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Andres Graffe, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5x21tf63g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g732d920z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):40600</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
