The increasing disability and death from obliterative disease of the coronary arteries, which all too frequently attacks men in the prime of life whose other organs are still intact and healthy, has stimulated widespread interest in the field of medicine to produce some means of increasing the blood flow to the ischemic myocardium.

In Quebec alone it has been estimated that there are about 1,400,000 acres of abandoned farmland (32). Some of this land is being turned into tree farms and more of it could be so utilized if some problems could be overcome. The chief difficulties existing are mainly those of uneven topography, poor drainage and low fertility status of the soil. This latter problem could be possibly the easiest difficulty to overcome provided adequate knowledge existed of the effects of fertilization on reforested areas. To assess relative fertility levels of soils for purposes of reforestation methods of soils analysis as well as plant analysis may be useful. These must be developed in conjunction with fertilizer application experiments either in the field or in the greenhouse under a controlled environment.</description><creator>Cotton, Donald.

It will then go on to deal with the literature on ECS and will pay special attention to the affect of ECS on memory when it is interpolated between learning and a retention test. Use of ECS for the study of memory and retention seems to be the result of three quite separate lines of thinking. Two of these are somewhat less important now: the idea, which has lasted for several centuries, that shock or stress of any kind is useful in treatment of mental illness; and a long-standing biological interest in the effects of electricity on the animal body. The third line, much more recent in origin and also more germane to our present concerns, involves the fusion of ideas about retrograde amnesia and retroactive inhibition in the theory of the consolidation period in learning.</description><creator>Corson, John.

A further difficulty arises from the varied modes of sensation subsumed under the general heading of somesthesis. A considerable advance was made with the advent of newer electrophysiological techniques (including cortical stimulation in conscious patients, and evoked potential recording in lower animals), which permitted accurate mapping of somatosensory representation in the cerebral cortex.</description><creator>Corkin, Suzanne.

It is very widely distributed in the body and there is scarcely any organ which does not contain at least some histamine. Abnormal release of this substance or altered reactivity to histamine has been round to occur in many pathological conditions. However, the great amount of information which has accumulated over the years, has contributed very little in understanding the role,  that is the physiological function, if any, of this biological amine. In 1960 KAHLSON suggested that histamine has an important role in tissue growth. He based this theory on experiments performed on rats and round that during embryonal development and in regenerative and reparative growth, the histamine-forming capacity of the tissues involved is greatly increased.</description><creator>Constantopoulos, George.</creator><contributor>Kovacs, E.

As will be indicated in the following review, much of this work was undertaken primarily to eliminate the occurrence of serum sickness, a syndrome due to the intravascular interaction between passively administered heterologous antitoxic antisera and the antibodies formed to these antisera in the recipient. Enzymatic treatment of antitoxins was used in an attempt to reduce their antigenicity and hence their ability to elicit an immune responce, with its possibly disastrous sequelae. The early work on enzymatic degradation of antibodies was conducted almost exclusively with antitoxins produced in the horse, since this species has been the favoured source of antisera for clinical use.</description><creator>Cohen, Jesse.

The salamander leaves its egg and is able to swim soon afterwards. A newly hatched chick pecks accurately for food at the end of its first day. lnsects, amphibia, and birds display complex visually guided movement soon after they are born. Members of these species do not seem to require long periods of maturation, or special conditions in the sensory environment, in order to display coordinated patterns of sensory-motor integration. The human neonate, however, must undergo a relatively long period of learning and maturation before he is able to coordinate his movements with what he sees.</description><creator>Cohen, Harry.

Stoichiometric oxygen-hydrogen mixed with different amounts of helium made up the combustible charge. The electrode configurations were of the spherical-spherical or point-plane type. The parameters of the experiment were: 1. loading pressure 500, 800, 1200 and 2000 psia; 2. percentage helium 65, 70, 75 and 80%; 3. electrode gap spacing .002 to .010 inch. The tests showed that detonation-free combustion could be achieved over the complete pressure range, with mixtures containing between 70% and 80% helium. The point plane type was found to be the most suitable electrode configuration. For the same gap spacing, the breakdown voltage of the point-plane type was 20% below that of the spherical-spherical type, and could initiate combustion with a smaller gap. In a mixture containing 83% helium, the breakdown voltage in a quasi-uniform field, for partially conditioned electrodes, was found to be approximately linear with the product of pressure times gap spacing, when the product was greater than 2 lb/in. In the breakdown voltage versus pressure plot, the point-plane configuration, for the same mixture, exhibited a double inflection between 1400 and 1800 psia.</description><creator>Cohen, Abraham.

Another 50 years had passed before its physiological significance had become clear, following the studies of Laguesse (2). On the basis of histological observations, particularly referring to profuse vascularization of the islets, Laguesse suggested in 1893, that islet cell have an endocrine function. The classical experiments of Banting and Best (3) in 1922 lead to the identification of the hormone insulin and consequently to the treatment of diabetes. According to present knowledge, insulin is secreted by Beta cells. It has been shown that the insulin content of the splenic portion of the dog's pancreas is much higher than the duodenal portion.</description><creator>Chun, John.

First in rank is carcinoma of the uterus. In some reports (59), carcinoma of the breast ranked first; such is the case in New York state. The five year survival rate in operable breast carcinoma, by radical mastectomy is around f.fty per cent. This 5 year survival rate improves to seventy-five per cent if there are no regional or distant metastases and falls to around thirty per cent if the axillary lymph nodes are involved by metastatic disease. This tact stresses the importance of early diagnosis and treatment in carcinoma of the breast. Every year 25,000 American women die of cancer of the breast. This is a crude mortality rate of 24.6 per 100,000 for the United States (42).

Two strains of hemolytic E. coli were isolated consistently and in large numbers from the fecal samples of early weaned pigs that scoured shortly after weaning. 2. Symptoms of enteritis were reproduced artificially by contaminating the drinking water of the pigs with a live culture of one of the two strains of E. coli. The same strain of E. coli was isolated in very large numbers from the fecal samples of artificially infected animals. 4. The infection of this strain of E. coli was transmitted naturally by housing susceptible animals with the scouring animals.

Coumarin, present in "spoilt" clover, is sometimes ingested by livestock causing a haemorrhagic condition. Stahmann et al. (1941) identified dicoumarol as the active principle involved. Due to the strong structural relationship of dicoumarol with coumarin, Robert and Link (1937) believed that dicoumarol was formed from coumarin. Many of the coumarin derivatives are pharmacologically active and include anticoagulant drugs, rodenticides and insecticides. Due to its bitter taste and vanilla-like odour, coumarin itself has been employed for flavouring foods but its use has been discouraged owing to its damaging effect on the liver of animals.</description><creator>Chopra, Nirmala.</creator><contributor>Blackwood, A.

It is expressed either as a percentage or simply as a number. The term "reflectivity coefficient” is used by some authors for the same quantity. It is also understood that the albedo is restricted to the solar component of the radiation spectrum. For the present study the range of wavelengths is set effectively by the capability of the sensing instrument used which, in this case, is limited to the range 0.3 to 2.0 microns for the Kipp and Zonen Solarimeter. The energy emitted by the sun contained in the wavelengths greater than 2.0 microns is small by comparison to the energy contained in the wavelengths specified and can be safely ignored.</description><creator>Chia, Lin.

The important functions in animal reproduction such as sperm transport in the female tract, ovum transportation and phenomena involved in pregnancy and parturition, are believed to be associated and affected by the motility of the female genital tract. It is therefore clear that in order to have a better understanding, hence subsequent control of these factors, a more detailed knowledge of the nature of spontaneous and hormone-induced patterns of genital tract motility is essential.</description><creator>Chen, Ti-Wen.</creator><contributor>Graham, A.

A number of empirical equations concerned with gravity flow of solid particles through an orifice have been proposed. However, little work has been done on a liquid-particle bed moving through a restricted end under imposed liquid pressure. Chon, Kovacic and Hammitt (1) have recently studied the system of liquid-particle two-phase concurrent downward flow through a tube with a restricting orifice end. Their studies were concerned with the application of this type of flow system to a mobile fuel nuclear reactor where fine uranium or uranium oxide partials are continuously carried into the top of the reactor core in the form of dilute slurries, allowed to settle on the bed already formed in the core, and are exhausted through the restricting orifices at the ends.</description><creator>Chen, Erh-Chun.</creator><contributor>Chon, W.

All living things on this planet must have nitrogen in their food. The earth’s atmosphere contains far more than enough nitrogen to satisfy the requirement, yet relatively few of the species populating the earth are able to metabolize nitrogen from the atmosphere. This circumstance gives rise to important ecologic and economic consequences, and poses challenging questions for several branches of science. The first isolation of free living nitrogen fixing bacteria by Winogradsky and Beijernck stimulated attempts to assess the importance of non-symbiotic nitrogen fixation in the nitrogen economy of the soil. Though numerous papers have accumulated, they also provide opportunities for controversy ranging from polite disagreement to acrimonious debate, and most of them need careful reevaluation.</description><creator>Chang, Pin-Chuan.</creator><contributor>Knowles, R.

The longitudinal extent is half this distance, from 97 30" East to 105 30" East. It thus falls entirely within the tropical climate region. The country is bordered on the north-east by Laos, on the south-east by Cambodia, (these two countries, together with North Vietnam and South Vietnam, comprising the area once known as French Indo-China,) on the south by the Gulf of Thailand and Malaya and on the north-west and west by Burma. The whole country is made up of river plains, forested mountains, and plateaus. It is a tropical land where rice cultivation in the river basins is the primary mode of existence for its approximately 25.5 million people.</description><creator>Chakrabandhu, Peradej.</creator><contributor>Hazeland, A.

Dixon (1906) noted that muscarine mimicked vagal stimulation and later restated the possibility of humoral mediation by chemicals (Dixon and Hamill, 1909), an idea first put forward by Elliott (1904) with regard to the possible mode of action of adrenalin. The first indication that ACh was a naturally occurring substance came with its isolation from some extracts of ergot which had been observed to have pressor effects (Ewins, 1914).</description><creator>Chabrol, John.

The necessity of regulating the legal obligations resulting from such incidents, in a convention level, in order to obviate the application of the various domestic laws on the matter which do not contain standard liability provisions, among other things, was long felt. Such need stems from the economic policy obtaining in international air law to define, regulate and limit an aircraft operator's liability from catastrophic losses that usually results from a single aviation accident, and extend reasonable protection to the rights of end-users, including innocent third parties, who may have suffered injury or sustained damage as a result of aircraft operations.</description><creator>Catibog, Jose.

The study explored attitudes held by selected adolescent and adult groups in an attempt to contribute to a clarification of the extent to which adolescents rebel against adults and belong to a strong subculture of their own. Furthermore, it was hoped that such data might point a direction for effective social group work with adolescents. Following an attitudinal measurement model of Abraham J. Tannenbaum, ‘Adolescent Attitudes Toward Academic Brillance’ (New York: Columbia University, 1962), data were gathered on attitudes towards adolescent characteristics representing reliance on adults, peers, and convention. These characteristics were described by verbal stereotypes to which respondents were asked to give social acceptance ratings.</description><creator>Carniol, Benjamin.</creator><contributor>Shiner, E.

Ferrell and again in 1960 by P.R. Wallace. There is therefore little need to give a detailed historical survey of its development; we will limit ourselves to a brief summary of the state of the theory as reviewed by Farrell and then pass immediately to a discussion of some of the more recent work which has a direct bearing on this thesis. In a typical positron annihilation experiment, a high energy positron from some β+ decay source penetrates deep into a thin metal sample and quickly becomes thermalized. This low energy positron then "migrates" through the sample and eventually annihilates with one of the metallic electrons with subsequent emission of two quanta.</description><creator>Carbotte, Jules.

Current surgical techniques tend to destroy the normal relationships of the papillary muscles and there is some clinical evidence (16.20) that this is detrimental to the cardiac dynamics. Current understanding of the importance of the papillary muscle mechanism is limited by a lack of information describing the activities of the papillary muscles. It is the object of this thesis to investigate the activity of the papillary muscles and to relate these observations to an understanding of the role of the papillary muscles in atrioventricular valve function.</description><creator>Busse, Edward.
