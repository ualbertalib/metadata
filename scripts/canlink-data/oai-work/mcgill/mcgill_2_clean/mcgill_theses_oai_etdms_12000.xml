But how they are related and the degree to which they are interdependent has never been considered systematically. Hilgard (6, p. 181) has pointed to what is in all probability the major stumbling block. Leading theorists have been too long preoccupied with either one or the other of the two fields of investigation, and it can be fairly said that they have neglected the relationship between them. Kohler (9, p. 192), for example, would have us believe that if past experience does exert an influence upon perceptual organization, “it must be restricted to particular situations”. Furthermore, those who believe otherwise “will have to support their theory by experiments of their own”. Certainly the evidence gathered in support of the Gestalt view (8), (10), (18) is voluminous and persuasive.[...]</description><creator>Mishkin, Mortimer.</creator><contributor>Ferguson, G.

Even where governments provide social security measures through Public Welfare, relief from such sources is seldom adequate, if we define adequate relief as “That which Covers the deficit existing between the budget and the family earnings and what relatives give.” Where relief is given through private agencies it is rarely adequate to meet the full needs of a family or individual. This inadequacy is associated with a large problem which clients bring to the attention of the agency, that of indebtedness.

Experimental investigations into the functions of the nervous system brought early rewards along the lines of increase in function resulting from its excitation.

The question is, how the stimulation manifests itself”.[...] This thesis will be presented in three parts, with a final general discussion and summary.

(2) To determine the nature of negative resistance elements and the manner in which they may be introduced into a transmission line such that they cancel a portion of the positive resistance of the latter. (3) To establish the criteria for stability of transmission lines embodying negative resistance elements. (4) To determine the required spacing interval between negative resistance units. (5) To determine the factors governing the design of negative resistance loading elements to give specific transmission characteristics.

Yan carried out an investigation in this laboratory on the solvent effects of liquid ammonia on woody materials, chiefly concerning himself with sugar maple wood. He found that liquid ammonia at 25° extracted nearly 6% by weight of maple wood, and the extract was separated into three fractions, acetamide 4%, “liquid ammonia lignin” 0.7%, and a polyuronide material 0.8%. The “liquid ammonia lignin” was investigated by Yan, and a possible formula was suggested. The nearly quantitative production of acetamide from the acetyl groups of the wood showed that the liquid ammonia cleaved any ester links that were present. This Inference suggested that the wood residue after liquid ammonia extraction might be chemically changed, and that components previously insoluble might then be capable of extraction. The present thesis is devoted to investigating this possibility. It was found that hot water could extract about 2% of polysaccharide material, not previously water-soluble, from the ammonia-extracted wood residue. This polysaccharide was a xylan - methoxyglucuronic acid complex, contaminated with pectic material, and the greater part of the work was concerned with attempts to purify it and to determine its structure.</description><creator>Neubauer, Lewis Gregory.</creator><contributor>Purves, C.

The stimulus in this work has been great due to the high mortality and morbidity resulting from diseases of the coronary arteries. [...] Since medical therapy does not alter or diminish the progress of the underlying changes in the vessels, there is a need for surgical therapeutic measures. In eighty percent of cases coronary artery disease is not immediately fatal when first diagnosed; thus, surgical therapy may be employed to modify or prevent further progression of the disease which almost invariably follows. The present investigations were carried out to study the development of anastomoses between a transplanted left internal mammary artery and the vessels of the left ventricular myocardium. Previous work by Vineberg et al. [...] showed that in a dog a left internal mammary artery transplanted into the left ventricular myocardium could form anastomoses with the coronary circulation. In one series anastomoses occurred in forty-four percent of cases. The object of the present work was (1) to determine and clarify the factors responsible for the development of functioning anastomoses and (2) to determine whether such anastomoses would protect the myocardium against coronary occlusion.</description><creator>Niloff, Paul H.</creator><contributor>MacKenzie, D.

It is shown that all such methods in present use involve comparison with some standard of phase shift, using a null method. Two circuits considered in detail are the conventional wave interference method and the Robertson “Homodyne” method. In the Robertson method signal energy is split into two paths. In the carrier path the original signal frequency traverses a calibrated phase shifter. In the sideband path the signal is converted into double sideband suppressed carrier energy and traverses a path into which are introduced unknown increments of phase shift. A null at a junction of the two paths is obtained when the carrier is in quadrature phase with the sidebands. A description of a laboratory setup of the Robertson circuit and its adjustment procedure are given.

But until recently his value as a critic went unrecognized. With the full publication of his writings, however, there has been an increasing respect for his pungently expressed comments on his contemporaries. One critic has advisedly pointed out that from his letters “one could extract a handbook of critical aphorisms worth more to those who are now writing, than imitative study of what was peculiar in Hopkin’s verse,”. W. H. Gardner, perhaps the most balanced and thorough of Hopkins’s critics, after a careful consideration of the poet’s critical analyses, maintains: “To sum up, Hopkins’s critical remarks with their vigorous style and constant preoccupation with definite ethical and aesthetic standards, frequently reminds us of the honest and trenchant manner of Dr. Johnson ... Though he could at times be harsh and hypercritical, Hopkins’s taste was more catholic, his perception more versatile than that of Johnson, who had not enjoyed the advantage of early enlightenment at the feet of Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Keats. With Hopkins as with Johnson, however, it is usually difficult if not dangerous to disagree; in either case, disagreement always entails an exhilarating mental exercise, a salutary revision and reaffirmation of our own principles.”</description><creator>Orr, Paul Anthony.</creator><contributor>Anderson, P.

In the 19th century the controversy over the question of spontaneous generation and the establishement of the science of bacteriology caused a great interest in the micro-flora of the air and thus originates a branch of science known now as aerobiology. Aerobiology as defined by the late F. C. Meier in 1938, is the study of aerial carriage of microscopic particles. Durham (1941) when quoting Meier’s definition suggested a slight modification of the above mentioned term to aeromicrobiology thus defining more clearly the actual field of investigation. At the present time the study of aerobiology as specified by The Committee on Apparatus in Aerobiology of the National Research Council (1941) is carried on by workers in several fields having a rather wide range of objectives. [...] 1. Sanitary air analysis and disinfection; 2. air borne pollen dissemination; 3. microorganisms in the upper air; 4. epidemiology of plant diseases; 5. insect population and migration in the air. In approaching the study of aerobiology we have to bear in mind the characteristics of the outer atmosphere that provides an infinite source of dilution, as compared with semi-enclosed atmosphere in which the dilution is restricted, thus facilitating the spread of infection.[...]</description><creator>Pawlikowska, Anna M.</creator><contributor>Kelly, C.

Many oxidations have been investigated[...] Most oxidations appear to be greatly dependent on the physical state of the cellulose and yield complex materials having varying proportions of carboxyl and carbonyl groups. With a few notable exceptions, methods available for estimating these groups are not entirely trustworthy and there is need for dependable methods of a general nature which could be applied throughout the field of cellulose oxidations. This Thesis was undertaken to develop a method of differentiating between carbonyl groups located in the second, third and sixth positions of the glucose units in cellulose. The procedure adopted consisted of adding the elements of hydrogen cyanide to the carbonyl units and reducing the adducts with hydriodic acid to the corresponding hydrocarbon units. It was necessary to repeat Kiliani’s parallel work with glucose and fructose, carried out in 1885-1887, most carefully in order to establish the best experimental conditions. A cellulose modified by diverse treatments and oxidized with chromium trioxide, was chosen for the research, and advantage was taken of the opportunity to compare the relative merits of various published estimations for carbonyl groups in oxidized celluloses.</description><creator>Perlin, Arthur S.</creator><contributor>Purves, C.

Chemical, spectrographic and microbiological methods have been applied with varying degrees of success; and the problems involved have exerted an appreciable influence over the entire field of biochemical analysis. More strictly physiological work has made it possible to assign specific biochemical functions to certain of the substances involved. A classic instance is the role of thiamine as a constituent of co-carboxylase. Research on the possible parts played by these substances in cell metabolism has, in fact, become a major subdivision of biochemical research. [...] The action of the organism is believed to be due to the presence of an enzyme system which is highly specific for the destructive oxidation of nicotinic acid and which has been provisionally named nicotinic acid oxidase. The specificity and activity of the enzyme are such that it can be applied to the determination of nicotinic acid. The research described in the present thesis is an extension of this work. It has centered round three main issues: (a) the elucidation of the mode of action of nicotinic acid oxidase by experiments involving the use of various analogues and inhibitors, (b) the isolation of nicotinic acid oxidase from the bacterial cell and (c) the identification of intermediate and end products of the nicotinic acid oxidation.[...]</description><creator>Pinsky, Alex.</creator><contributor>Common, R.

These early investigators used various kinds of mazes and problem boxes to describe the variables under examination. Since these pioneer attempts, new mazes and problem boxes have been designed, and a great deal of the research carried on in the field of comparative psychology has involved mazes of one type or another. A different “type of maze, designed by Hebb and Williams, (3), to evaluate rat intelligence, has provided the most recent improvement in animal testing apparatus. This thesis reports the development of an improvement of the Hebb and Williams intelligence test, and presents measures of reliability and validity for the use of this procedure and apparatus. The traditional procedure in the evaluation of rat intelligence is to test the animal’s learning ability in a maze and infer from this behaviour the animal’s level of intelligence. “While the mazes and problem boxes used in this procedure vary greatly in design, they all have certain characteristic disadvantages.[...]</description><creator>Rabinovitch, Mortimer Sam.</creator><contributor>Rosvold, H.

Quantitative studies of these degradations have, however, failed to account for more than approximately 70% of the lignin complex. [...] Since phenolic compounds are thought to yield no benzenepolycarboxylic acids when similarly oxidized, the production of the latter from lignin suggests that not all of the lignin molecule is based on guaiacyl or similar phenolic units. A thorough investigation of such oxidations of various lignins therefore appeared highly desirable. The procedures employed by the earlier workers were repeated, but it was soon found that the methods reported in the literature for isolating and separating the benzenepolycarboxylic acids from the debris of an oxidation of lignin were quite inadequate. New methods of isolation and identification were required [...] Various lignins isolated from spruce wood, spruce wood itself, and a commercial alkali lignin from poplar wood were then oxidized and the products examined with the help of the procedures for isolation and separation devised from the study of the individual acids.</description><creator>Read, Donald Earle.</creator><contributor>Purves, C.

Cette classe, bien entendu, est loin d’être uniforme. Comme toutes autres classes sociales, elle a son aristocratie et elle a ses pauvres. II y a, par exemple, une grande différence entre le laboureur. descendant du franc tenancier, qui possède un petit lopin de terre, qui vit exclusivement de la culture de son champ et qui est fier de son indépendance, et le domestique. qui, loué a l’année, dépend de son employeur pour sa nourriture et son logement. Aussi les caractères et les moeurs diffèrent-ils largement dans les diverses régions de la France. Cependant, il y a un trait commun a toute cette partie du peuple français: c’est que les paysans sont tous près de la nature. Aisés ou pauvres, ils sont tous en contact direct avec la terre. Quand un paysan enrichi met de cote ses outils pour vivre dans une aisance complète, il cesse d’être paysan dans le vrai sens du mot. Seul celui qui manie les outils du champ peut se reconnaître vrai paysan. Le vrai paysan est celui qui laboure la terre et qui sème les champs, qui houe et qui pioche et qui bêche les récoltes qui poussent, qui récolte les fruits de ses longs et durs travaux.
