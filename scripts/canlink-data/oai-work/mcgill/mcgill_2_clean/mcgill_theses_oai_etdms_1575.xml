One such interesting application is the control of wheeled mobile robots. This thesis presents four approaches that can be used to control these nonholonomic systems. The first three approaches are used to stabilize a robot mounted on a two-wheeled cart, while the fourth one stabilized a robot mounted on a four-wheeled cart. Feedback linearization can stabilize or track the position but not the orientation of the cart, so practical stabilization can be achieved by tracking a continuously moving reference cart. A geometric approach can stabilize the position and orientation of the cart but leads to discontinuous controls. The Lyapunov function approach applies an intelligent trick to the orientation angle and succeeds in stabilizing the cart using continuous controls. The simple feedback for nonholonomic chains approach partitions a system in chained form into two subsystems and uses a switching control law to achieve practical stabilization. All the approaches are simulated to illustrate their characteristic properties.</description><creator>Achkar, Alain J.</creator><contributor>H., Michalska (advisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Four ways to stabilize a nonholonomic system on the example of a mobile robot</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r781wj11h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cz30pv77v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bv73c267w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:09:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The question of perception constitutes one of the most complex and important sections of philosophical psychology. Unlike the Intellectual perception (al-idrak al-$ sp{c}aql bar i)$, which met with more or less agreement among philosophers, particular perceptions (al-idrakat al-juz'iyah) and more specifically, sensory (al-idrak al-hissi) and imaginal perception (al-idrak al-khayali) were felt to be problematic. How do these kinds of perception occur and what is their reality? Is there any difference between particular and universal perceptions? This study deals with these problems from the standpoint of Sadr al-Din al-Shirazi (Mulla Sadra), one of the greatest Islamic philosophers in the 16th and 17th century, whose work in this field is barely known. Comparing Mulla Sadra's contribution with that of his predecessors from both the Peripatetic and Illuminationist Schools, namely Ibn Sina and al-Suhrawardi this thesis attempts to explain what Mulla Sadra has offered as new ideas and new analyses in this regard. "The immateriality of perception," "unification of the subject and the object" and "the role of the soul in particular perception" are the main issues that are dealt with in this thesis.</description><creator>Zarean, Mohammad Javad</creator><contributor>Landolt, H.

I posit that the extensive, and often contradictory, use of "performance" within lesbian and gay discourse serves as a useful entry point to explore existing theoretical precepts of identity formation, and the processes of representation and signification. Through this exploration, effective theoretical and practical techniques can be developed to subvert the dominant discourses of normative (hetero)sexuality that continue to create a "reality" which is physically and psychically harmful to those who do not adhere to these discourses. Lesbian and gay activists have used various performance techniques as political tools to de-stabilize notions of identity and the fixity of the representational process. Some lesbian and gay academics have developed a "queer" theoretical perspective that concurrently binds and privileges fluid concepts of representation, identity formation, and gender/sexuality performativity. In this thesis, I argue that the convergence of performance and performativity within the work of Annie Sprinkle yields an especially clear potential for the disruption of a signification process that consistently demonizes the sexual "Other."</description><creator>Winzell, Cherie</creator><contributor>Kaite, Berkeley (advisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Performance art.</subject><subject>Gays -- Social conditions.</subject><subject>Gender identity.</subject><subject>Gays -- Identity.</subject><subject>Sprinkle, Annie, 1954-</subject><title>Performance of a lifetime : an exploration of notions of "performance" in lesbian and gay activist and academic rhetoric</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v692t842s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9306t130d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Graduate Communications Program</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:d791sj342</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:09:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Neglected by traditional literary histories or misrepresented in gender-specific criticism, Eliza Haywood is properly a novelist whose innovations can be seen in the works of Defoe and Richardson. This thesis examines selected novels by the London-based Haywood (1693?-1756) in light of their contributions to the novel form. It begins by considering her romance novellas as adaptations of the popular scandal novels of Delariviere Manley. Haywood's early fiction combines the concerns of amatory fiction with the political expediencies of satire. Over the course of her career, Haywood's early romance novellas expanded to become conduct novels. In their endorsement of a prudent conjugal happiness over erotic fulfilment, her later works exemplify the changing proprieties at the heart of the eighteenth-century British novel. The argument of this thesis is the contention that Haywood's prose fiction provides a fresh and significant perspective upon a pivotal period in eighteenth-century British fiction.</description><creator>Walsh, Jo Ann</creator><date>1995</date><subject>Haywood, Eliza Fowler, 1693?-1756 -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><title>The development of the novel in the prose fictions of Eliza Haywood</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cc08hh71w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d791sj342</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kd17cw186</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:09:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Natural Exponential Families (NEF) belonging to the Grand-Babel class have variance functions (VF) of the form V$ sb{F}$(m) = P(m)$ Delta(m)$ + Q(m)$ sqrt{ Delta(m)},$ with P,Q and $ Delta$ polynomials with deg P $ geq$ 3, deg Q $ geq$ 2 and deg $ Delta$ $ geq$ 2. Although the members of this class have not as yet all been enumerated, several useful sub-classes have been fully described, namely the Morris class, with at most quadratic polynomial VFs: the Mora class, with cubic polynomial Vfs; the Babel class, with deg P = 0, deg Q $ leq$ 1 and deg $ Delta$ $ leq$ 2; and the Seshadri class, with deg P = degQ = deg$ Delta$ = 1. In order to motivate a uniform presentation of each member of these classes in compendium form, the basic properties of NEFs are surveyed, with special insistence on extension models such as convolution families, exponential dispersion models and affinities of NEFs. The Grand-Babel NEFs are presented with both a canonical parametrization which emphasizes the link to their basis measure and a more familiar or utilitarian parametrization. Expressions for the variance function, the cumulant transform, the mean-domain mapping, the density (when available), the Legendre transform and some asymptotics are given for each NEF, thus providing links to the theories of Likelihood and Quasi-likelihood, Generalized Linear Models, Saddlepoint approximation, Large deviations, Distributions and Asymptotic approximation. The notion of Canonical Caste Member (CCM), an easily identifiable representative of the equivalence class of all affinities of a NEF, is introduced; correspondingly, a table of variance functions for the CCMs of the currently classified Grand-Babel NEFs is provided.</description><creator>Vandal, A.

The thought of one as of the other, therefore, surpasses largely the principal reason of their research: If Freud applies the principles of the interpretation of dreams to the study of literary works, Bakhtin expands on the novel theory and questions polyphony and dialogism of all language. In conception of the literary speech of Bakhtin and of the dreams of Freud, the signs, the speeches and the multiple intentions or affects that animate them are constantly in dynamic interaction and obey it seems, to mechanism of similar transformation. The problem of interpretation is at the center of their works. The two authors are at the same time theoreticians and analysts of whom the theory of literature, of speeches, of work and dreams, pass necessarily by an act of interpretation. We are aware of the role played by the novels of Dostoievski on the theoretical work of Bakhtin. For Freud also, the principles of the work on dreams, according to his own affirmation develop with the interpretation process. We have to think that for him as for the Russian researcher, the theory is always in a link of active complicity with the interpretation; that one and the other are constantly mutually reflected and determined. A compared analysis of their texts can put in evidence the proximity of the thought processes of the thinkers, but can reveal also the differences, with their consequences from the point of view of ideology, ontology, even ethics.</description><creator>Touchette, Martine</creator><contributor>Desrosiers-Bonin, Diane (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Freud, Sigmund, 1856-1939</subject><subject>Bakhtin, M.

These alternative programs have included vocational education, work experience education, various forms of tracking, and within Quebec, the Individualized Paths for Learning Program (IPL). Individualized Paths for Learning was developed to allow "at risk" students to work towards their high school diploma at a more individualised pace, and to ease their transition into the work force through job skills training and work site experience. As this case study of an Individualized Paths for Learning program suggests however, IPL in practice provides very limited work and academic preparation for the students involved. Through interviews with students and staff, and participant observation within the classroom the limitations of the program become apparent. Yet paradoxically both students and staff were committed to the program and continued to subscribe to the importance of education which is fostered both socially and by the IPL program itself. Within this case study, the students' impressions of the IPL program were of special interest. It is their words, as those most involved and affected by it, that are used in analysis. While this study is specific to its setting it hopefully will provide insight into work education programs following similar principles.</description><creator>Taylor, Meredith</creator><contributor>Rains, Prue (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Slow learning children -- Education, Secondary -- Québec (Province) -- Evaluation.</subject><subject>Vocational education -- Québec (Province) -- Evaluation.</subject><title>Working without credit : a case study of Quebec's IPL high-school program</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n296x1240.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dr26z0500</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Sociology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:r207tr422</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:09:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is a complete edition of the journals and letters of Fanny Burney (1752-1840) for January 1789. Burney was a successful and well-known writer in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries. In addition to a number of plays and essays, which were not published during her lifetime, Burney published four novels in her career: Evelina (1778), Cecilia (1782), Camilla (1796), and The Wanderer (1814). It is, however, her journal writing that has captured the attention of the literary world in recent years because of its biographical, socio-historical, and literary value. Her journal for the month of January 1789, written at Court while Burney was serving Queen Charlotte as 2$ sp{ rm nd}$ Keeper of the Robes, is addressed to her sister Susanna Elizabeth (Burney) Phillips and her friend Frederica Locke. Included in this month is one letter addressed to her sister Charlotte Ann (Burney) Francis.</description><creator>Spanos, Kalliopi Maria</creator><contributor>Troide, Lars (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Burney, Fanny, 1752-1840 -- Diaries</subject><title>An edition of the early journals and letters of Fanny Burney : January, 1789</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xg94hr75k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r207tr422</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vq27zq66r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:09:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The subject of this paper is of cultures of terror, and more specifically of the possibility of resistance in a context of extreme fear. The focus is upon ways in which survivors of the Pol Pot regime devise strategies of embodied resistance, and rebuild notions such as identity and bodily integrity, within a Buddhist framework, to the dominant discourse of terror in contemporary Cambodian society. The paper problematizes the concept of "order" and questions its validity as a dominant paradigm in anthropology. Further, in searching for new ways of theorizing and writing about resistance and terror, it suggests that a more power conscious analysis of popular religion and ritual may prove enlightening. A theoretical framework is derived from a review of anthropological studies of terror and political violence. Of particular interest is the concept of "spaces of resistance" and the notions of "spaces of violence" and "bodily resistance" which it invokes. From within this framework the Dhammayietra, or peace walk, is considered as an embodied symbol of resistance and empowerment. It is hypothesized that the Dhammayietra may provide a way in which, through the symbolic "washing away" of Khmer Rouge memories; through the creation of new collective memories; and through the reclaiming of a physical manifestation (Angkor Wat) of the Buddhist-centered world view, some Cambodians may be able, at least in part, to emerge from the sensorially numb space which they created in order to survive the bodily, intellectual, and emotional assault upon their persons, culture, and religions by the Khmer Rouge.</description><creator>Skidmore, Monique</creator><contributor>Corin, Ellen (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Violence -- Religious aspects -- Buddhism</subject><subject>Terror -- Cambodia.</subject><subject>Violence -- Cambodia -- History.</subject><subject>Government, Resistance to -- Cambodia.</subject><subject>Cambodia -- Social conditions.</subject><title>The politics of space and form : cultural idioms of resistance and re-membering in Cambodia</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5m60qv081.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vq27zq66r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anthropology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cr56n324q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:09:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis will partly compare the approaches of two pioneers in Islamic philosophy to the soul-body problem: the philosophical psychology of Mulla Sadra (Sadr al-Muta'allihin Shirazi 975-1050/1571-1640) and that of Ibn Sina (370-428/980-1037). Our main concern will be with the former, the founder of "trancendent theosophy", particularly his ideas regarding the corporeal generation of the soul. A brief historical background of the problem is presented in the first chapter. In order to evaluate the real philosophical value of Mulla Sadra's doctrine, the thesis will investigate the soundness of Mulla Sadra's novel psychological findings. "Substantial motion" (al-harakah al-jawhariyyah) and the "gradation of existence" (al-tashkik fi maratib al-wujud) are the two main philosophical principles formulated and implied by our philosopher regarding the elaboration of his theory on the soul's developmental process. In our study, we discuss the nature of the soul-body relationship, the evidence which indicates their mutual interaction, and finally, the various forms of this relationship. In the final chapter, we focus on the developmental process of the soul's substantial motion up to the stage of union with the active intellect. Our analytical discussion is centered on whether or not the theory of the corporeality of the soul's generation yields a meaningful conception of the soul's evolution from materiality to immateriality. Considering the serious challenges and unsolved difficulties that still remain, it is an open question whether Sadra's theory, particularly its emphasis on the corporeality of the soul's generation, can adequately account for the soul's developmental process up to the stage of unity with the world of intellects.</description><creator>Shameli, Abbas Ali</creator><contributor>Landolt, Hermann (advisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Avicenna, 980-1037</subject><subject>Ṣadr al-Dīn Shīrāzī, Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm, d. 1641.</subject><subject>Mind and body</subject><title>A comparative study concerning the soul-body problem in the philosophical psychology of Mullā Ṣadrā (1571-1640) and ibn Sīnā (980- 1037)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7p88cj71q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cr56n324q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Islamic Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gb19f809w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:09:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This is a study of the use of language in Joseph Heller's novels Catch-22, Something Happened, Good as Gold, God Knows and Picture This. Heller's fiction is characterized by self-negating sentences and logic, a repetitive story line and circular structure. Each novel concerns the relationship between people and language, but the relationship invariably is circular and inherently non-progressive. The separation between people and language, analogous to the separation between existence and expression, is the basis for Heller's thematics. Joseph Heller is a novelist who writes about language. Heller's novels all contain or evoke a common system characterized by self-containment and self-reference. In this system, language and literature are self-referential. It is implicit within Heller's writing that literature is a self-contained, non-progressive system, and consequently, it cannot yield a conclusive resolution. The self-contained system of his novels becomes analogous for literature, language, and finally knowledge. Definitive knowledge, being a derivative of language, is impossible. Eventually, Heller's fiction allows no final resolution because of the inconclusive nature of language itself.</description><creator>Rojas, René</creator><contributor>Lindeman, Yehudi (advisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Heller, Joseph -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><title>Language and the system : the closed world of Joseph Heller's fiction</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dv13zw634.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gb19f809w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:s1784n832</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:10:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Although the figure of the warrior woman has always existed as a literary topos, the popularity of the warrior woman figure has never been greater than in the period of the Italian Renaissance. The character of the female warrior in the 14th and 15th centuries in Italy results from many literary traditions ranging from the Amazons of classical and medieval times, to the many versions of the Aeneid to the character of Aigiarne in the Milione of Marco Polo. In addition, other examples exist of female characters who demonstrate their fighting capabilities who, without necessarily being considered warrior women, have helped nonetheless to shape the character of the warrior woman in the Italian Renaissance. The main objective of this thesis is to document the formation of the warrior woman figure in Italian Cavalier Romance poems dating from the late 1300's to the early 1400's before the great poems of Pulci and Boiardo.</description><creator>Regan, Dawn E.

It is the mere presence of the object that enables one to so much as venture to conceive of such abstract realities as Time, Space and other human and inhuman existences. For the object provokes an awakening of consciousness to the being of these three realities: the object renders form and dimension to space, thus providing concrete reference for the human mind. The object transposes time, as it is situated in a precise and historical moment; or, the object may serve as a reflection of another time and space. And ultimately, the object reminds one that the Other exists by bestowing an identity upon it; in fact, the object creates the other's existence. Yet, the object is a being in itself, a reality that remains perpetually indomitable; the object is the Other. The fictional text, La chasse aux poils, is a compilation of three short stories in which is brought to light the relation existing between the subject and the object.</description><creator>Quinn, Suzanne</creator><date>1994</date><subject>Object (Philosophy) in literature</subject><title>Rapport du sujet à l'objet dans le récit</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cv43p0303.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s1784n84b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1831cn00v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:10:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is an empirical comparison of the relationship between money and other key economic variables and investigates an alternative method of defining money in Canada. Severe theoretical problems with traditional monetary aggregation methods are identified and Divisia aggregates are examined through the use of index number and aggregation theory. Summation and Divisia aggregates are constructed, tested and compared in three critical areas: information content, causality and stability. In particular this thesis investigates whether Divisia money is a potentially useful indicator of economic conditions. The data consists of Canadian quarterly observations for the period 1968.1 to 1989.4 for 26 different monetary assets and their own rates of return. The Divisia indices do not clearly outperform their summation counterparts but do show consistent and stable growth trends during the period in question. The results show that Divisia monetary aggregation is theoretically more appealing than the simple sum approach and that Divisia money provides meaningful information for Canadian monetary policy.</description><creator>Pusch, John J.</creator><date>1995</date><subject>Monetary policy -- Canada</subject><title>Monetary aggregation in Canada</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p8418q27x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1831cn00v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Economics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x346d630d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:10:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this descriptive study is to examine how some large organizations selected for the quality of their human resource management (HRM) practices evaluate their human resource (HR) function, and to investigate the purpose and usefulness of HRM evaluation within these organizations. Five questions are investigated: (1) Who decides whether or not to evaluate the HR function? (2) What are the objectives of HRM evaluation? (3) What is the focus of HRM evaluation? (4) What are the means used to evaluate HRM? (5) What is the impact of HRM evaluation on the direction of human resource management within the organization? Despite the growing strategic importance of human resource management, there is still little research evaluating its effectiveness. Most participants consider that their organization does not systematically evaluate HRM. Most use indirect or informal methods. This confirms that systematic HRM evaluation is not a priority for most organizations. Some Vice-Presidents, Human Resources (VPHR) expressed disappointment with this situation and indicated that the necessary resources were not available. Within the limited sample of 10 organizations, the HRM evaluation practices are diversified. The extent of HRM evaluation is surprising given the reservations and modesty expressed by the participants. Most organizations have evaluated multiple HRM policies, programs or services representative of multiple sub-systems within the HRM system. The high-impact HR function uses performance measures to support its business plans and to convincingly communicate the benefits of its contribution to the stakeholders, especially senior management. Despite a strong continuous improvement culture and the participation of the VPHR in strategic decision making, measuring HRM effectiveness and benchmarking against the best HRM practices is not a systematic process in most organizations.</description><creator>Provost, J.-C.

But his account of the epistemological character of yogic intuition was controversial. Indeed, while it consists in a full understanding of a conceptual object (i.e. the four noble truths), Dharmakirti insisted that, due to its clarity, the yogin's intuition be considered a category of sensation, which by definition is non-conceptual and pertains to particular objects. This thesis is an analysis of Dharmakirti's account of yogic intuition as a category of cognition allowing the non-conceptual knowledge of conceptual objects.</description><creator>Prévèreau, Raynald</creator><contributor>Hayes, Richard P.

This thesis proposes a new reading of the text according to three different perspectives. We will first retrace, through eleven editions, the editorial history of the "Discours" and, by the same means, of Garneau's Histoire. This reconstitution more particularly reveals the impact of the Histoire on the public at its first publication and the successive readings' influence on the work's form. We will then analyse the ideological content of the "Discours preliminaire" and, lastly, taking into account recent studies on the art of the essay, consider its form. These two last efforts at grasping the specificity of the "Discours" reveal a text not of purely functional value, but one full of doubt and uncertainties which provides a vivid illustration of French Canada's crisis following the Union Act of 1840.</description><creator>Potvin, Julie</creator><contributor>Ricard, Francois (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Historiography -- Québec (Province)</subject><subject>Garneau, F.-X.

Mathematics is important to the success of such an initiative, but very little attention has been given to this area. This paper presents the results of a four-year study examining the strategies used by intellectually disabled children when adding numbers. At the beginning of the study, all subjects could count to 10 and recognize numbers to 10, but most could not add. Subjects were evaluated each year on their ability to solve addition problems with sums no greater than nine. Subjects were divided into three groups based on first year results. Those in group 1 demonstrated no knowledge of addition, group 2 used the erroneous strategy of adding one to an addend, and group 3 included children with Down Syndrome who used a variety of strategies. Over the next three years, subjects, in general, progressed in a manner similar to nondisabled children with regard to strategies, the order in which they were developed, error patterns, and the order in which number pairs were memorized.</description><creator>Poth, Katalin N.</creator><contributor>Hanrahan, James P.

The painter also worked as a stage and costume designer for the Compagnie della Calza. As a result, he selected and combined elements of other disciplines in his pictures. This thesis focuses on the fusion of the arts in Tintoretto's imagery. A comprehensive analysis of this interdisciplinary aspect reveals the subtlety of Tintoretto's creative mind. The challenge is to discover Tintoretto as a stage designer who conceived pictures as theatrical performances. Instead of the traditional preparatory sketch, he built a miniature stage in order to visualize the scene in tangible forms existing in light and space. The design of the setting, the gestural choreography of his personages and the distribution of lighting were analysed and then translated into painted illusion. With this unusual methodology, Tintoretto invented forceful mise-en-scenes which induce the spectator to perceive the imaginary as real. A substantial knowledge of stagecraft also enabled him to bring to vibrant life the dramatic episodes of the Bible on canvas. Through such artfully constructed theatrical illusion, Tintoretto not only re-creates a vision for his audience, but above all, conveys the depth of his spiritual experience.</description><creator>Pham, Van Khanh</creator><date>1995</date><subject>Tintoretto, 1518-1594 -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><title>Theatricality in Tintoretto's religious paintings</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cv43p031c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1n79h655q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Art History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5h73pz092</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:10:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this study was to measure the intensity and duration of ice hockey play for six university hockey players (three forwards and three defencemen) and to compare them with the results to a similar study published in 1976. Comparisons of heart rate output and time-motion characteristics between forwards and defencemen were examined as well as differences in intensity between practices and games. The players performed at significantly lower intensity, had less playing time per shift, and had less playing time per game than the players in the 1976 study. Both investigations had similar bench times between shifts. The forwards had significantly different time-motion characteristics from the defencemen but similar playing time intensity. The intensity of games was higher than practices in terms of on-ice intensity but similar in terms of total time above a threshold intensity ($ geq$ 70% of HRmax).</description><creator>Peddie, David L.

Qualitative analysis of documentary evidence and interviews with 40 Belizean educators was combined with quantitative analysis of enrollment and other statistics. The data collected identified the major development milestones including compulsory attendance for primary students, the Primary School Leaving Certificate, the Belize National Selection examination for primary students, the Caribbean Examination Council examinations for secondary students and local teacher training. Major continuing issues include: lack of proper planning, inadequate human and financial resources, shortages of qualified teachers, high dropout rates, irrelevant curricula, and imbalance between rural and urban educational opportunity. This study concludes that although preschool, primary and secondary education has expanded, much still remains to be done to provide equal access, and improve its quality, effectiveness and efficiency.</description><creator>Pastor, Clara</creator><contributor>Anderson, G.

Seven classes of four-year old children and six classes of five-year-old participated as subjects. Thirteen playgroups of 6 girls and 6 boys each were formed. Analyses of the girls' and boys' interactions showed that there was a marginally significant trend for girls to engage in more Simultaneous Group Interaction than boys. Analyses of a second measure, Coordinated Group Activity, demonstrated that boys, after five years of age, were found to engage in significantly more group interaction than girls.

They produced plays, and contributed articles, poems and stories to socialist magazines, such as Masses and New Frontier. As the depression deepened and radical politics became less sectarian, women played a more prominent role in the cultural realm of radical politics. Their increased participation changed the way women were represented in art and literature; women's roles became less stereotypical, and women artists and writers combined both socialist and feminist concerns in their work. The journal New Frontier, founded by Jean "Jim" Watts and edited by two women and two men, provides numerous examples of socialist-feminist writing. Dorothy Livesay, one of the editors and a member of the Communist Party from 1932 to 1937, deserves special attention for her contribution to Canadian literature of social protest.</description><creator>Parker, Douglas Scott</creator><contributor>Levesque, Andree (advisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Communism -- Canada -- History</subject><subject>Women communists -- Canada</subject><title>Women in communist culture in Canada : 1932 to 1937</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0c483m218.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t148fk137</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h702q840h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:10:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This masters thesis in creative writing is comprised of two sections, a critical review of contemporary love stories written by women in the narrative mode and a novel entitled Si tes reves m'etaient contes.

How do women write about love, how do they portray men, what have become their amorous preoccupations in the recent years? Si tes reves m'etaient contes is the story of Catherine who, fast approaching her forties, reflects upon her life and her marriage.

Focusing on housing and investment property, it finds that women have a high degree of equality in household property ownership. This equality is due in part to gender equality under socialism as well as to traditions of equal inheritance. The thesis then considers women's property ownership in the context of the current 'anti-feminist' movement that encourages Czech and Slovak women to focus their energy on the domestic sphere. It suggests that the withdrawal of women from the workplace and politics may have serious consequences for gender equality.</description><creator>Occhipinti, Laurie</creator><contributor>Bossen, Laurel (advisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Land tenure -- Slovakia -- History.</subject><subject>Land tenure -- Czech Republic -- History.</subject><subject>Women -- Slovakia -- Social conditions.</subject><subject>Women -- Czech Republic -- Social conditions.</subject><title>Women and property in the Czech Republic and Slovakia</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/td96k4757.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m900nw660</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anthropology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):1600</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
