Studies of rapid adaptation commonly document the evolution of individual traits. Overall adaptation however, is a function of fitness itself, rather than the individual traits that contribute to fitness. Although numerous studies provide evidence for the evolution of specific traits on contemporary time scales, no published studies of wild animal populations have examined the evolution of a major fitness component following environmental change. My research demonstrates that an introduced population of guppies (Poecilia reticulata) has adapted to its new environment in less than ten years (13-26 generations). This adaptation consists of several phenotypic traits that have changed in the expected direction. Most critically, the introduced population now has higher survival than its ancestral source population when both are tested together in the introduction site. These results show that important components of fitness can evolve rapidly in populations, and that this evolution might influence the persistence of populations in the face of environmental change.</description><creator>Gordon, Swanne P.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Guppies -- Adaptation -- Trinidad and Tobago.</subject><subject>Natural selection -- Trinidad and Tobago.</subject><title>Evolution of fitness in the wild</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Swanne P.

Expression library immunisation is an un-biased screening technique that leads to the identification of novel, protective antigens that can be administered as components of a multivalent DNA vaccine (9, 50, 75, 86, 92). Here, a P. c. adami DS expression library has been evaluated as a malaria vaccine in mice, and several subpools of cross-protective plasmids have been identified. Upon vaccination with these plasmid subpools, mice demonstrate significantly lower mean cumulative parasitemia values than control vaccinated mice, when challenged with avirulent heterologous P. c. adami DK parasites. These cross-protective responses correlate with the induction of opsonizing antibodies against infected red blood cells and the production of IFN-gamma by T-cells. The determination of P. c. adami antigens capable of inducing strain-transcending immunity implies the identification of orthologues in the P. falciparum genome that may be applied as components of a human malaria vaccine.</description><creator>Grubb, Kimberley L.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Malaria vaccine.</subject><subject>DNA vaccines.</subject><title>A genomic approach to the identification of novel malaria vaccine antigens /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Kimberley L.

Using a novel metapopulation framework featuring nonequilibrium within-site disturbance cycles and limited dispersal, I investigate the large-scale response of marine mussel populations to changes in oceanographic productivity. By altering the fecundity parameter, I am able to shift from open to dynamically-coupled systems (DCS), thereby generating predictions that can be used to test the connectivity of marine populations. Within-site disturbance cycles scale-up and drive regional dynamics in both OS and DCS. Fast disturbance cycles induce synchronized oscillations that promote regional extinction risk in response to changes in oceanographic productivity for DCS but not OS. Slow disturbance cycles maintain spatial variability and temporal stability in both OS and DCS. These predictions can be used to test the applicability of OS theories to natural coastal ecosystems.</description><creator>Gouhier, Tarik Claude.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Shellfish populations -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Intertidal ecology -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Mytilidae -- Ecology.</subject><title>The role of disturbance cycles in marine mussel metapopulations /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Tarik Claude Gouhier, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ff365550k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4q77fr665</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q237hs23s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The biomechanics of running on level surfaces has been extensively researched, but there is limited knowledge on the biomechanical adaptations of curvilinear running. The purpose of this study was to investigate the electromyographic activity (EMG) of the lower leg muscles while running at two speeds (3.8 and 7.0 m/s) under three conditions (straight-away, flat curve, and banked curve of 11 degrees). Seven male elite track runners participated. Surface electrodes were placed bilaterally on the tibialis anterior (TA), peroneus longus (PL), and gastrocnemius lateralis (GL) muscles. In general, there was greater EMG activity and body lean at the higher speeds for each muscle (p&lt; 0.05); however minimal differences in EMG between the three surface running conditions (except for the second peak of TA). No bi-lateral asymmetry in muscle activation occurred during curved running, whether flat or banked. Future study should address more proximal segment and trunk muscular adaptations.</description><creator>Gow, Jennifer.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Running -- Physiological aspects.</subject><title>The effect of banked-curves on electromyographic activity in the lower leg during running : by Jennifer Gow.</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Jennifer Gow, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bn9996980.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q237hs23s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2n49t2092</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the major greenhouse gases and its significantly increasing emission may lead to higher temperatures and cause climate change. The sequestration of CO2 becomes crucial in stabilizing the greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere. The objective of this research is to examine the feasibility of using calcium silicate concrete to absorb CO2 in a flue gas collected from a cement plant and to investigate the effects of material compositions and process conditions on the CO2 uptake. The influencing factors include cement properties such as porosity, chemical component, pre-setting and post-curing as well as reaction parameters like CO2 concentration, moisture, exposed time, injection and releasing procedures and thickness of the compact. The interaction mechanisms are discussed. Results of mass gain are verified by infrared CO2 analysis. The typical mass gain for a cement paste compact is about 9% with a blend gas of 25% CO2 concentration, 5 bars pressure and 2 hours exposure using a multiple injection/release procedure. Under the same carbonation conditions, the as-captured flue gas with 13.6% CO2 concentration in 20 hours curing generates a mass gain of around 8%. The maximum possible CO2 uptake was investigated using the powder samples carbonated in a multiple step process at the best conditions. It is approximately 17% by the use of a blend gas of 25% CO2 concentration and 13.5% by the use of CO 2 + N2 gas of 25% CO2 concentration. The microstructures of the carbonated cement and concrete examined using SEM demonstrate that the material is composed of mostly amorphous or poorly crystalline forms of calcium carbonate incorporated into the hydration products. The pressure drop is employed to predict the mass gain and the remaining CO2 content in the gas. The prediction compares well with the experimental results.</description><creator>Zhou, Xu Dong, 1964-</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Engineering, Civil.</subject><title>CO₂ uptake through carbonation of concrete using simulated and as-captured flue gas</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Xu Dong Zhou, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wp988k138.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2n49t2092</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kh04dp97g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>On 31 November 2003 the 1999 Montreal Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air entered into force. Its purpose was to consolidate and modernize the Warsaw system and to reunify the provisions of several international instruments of private international air law under one legal instrument. The Montreal Convention consolidates the positive elements of the Warsaw Convention, the Hague Protocol, the Guadalajara Convention, the Guatemala City Protocol and Additional Protocol Numbers 3 and 4. It also simplifies and modernizes the requirements of documentation relating to the carriage by air of passengers, baggage and cargo. Most importantly, the Montreal Convention modernizes of the liability regime for death and injury to passengers by adopting the passenger liability regime in the IATA Inter-carrier Agreement. It also modernizes the liability regime for damage to baggage and cargo and the delay. In spite of the foregoing, the Montreal Convention fails to advance the unification of private international air law any further than the Warsaw Convention. This thesis analyzes the provisions of liability regimes under the Warsaw System and the 1999 Montreal Convention. Chapter one studies the liability regime established under the original Warsaw Convention and the subsequent attempts by states, air carriers and other interested entities to update it. Chapter two analyzes the new regime of unlimited liability established by the 1999 Montreal Convention. Chapter three examines the liability of the air carrier for damage caused by terrorist activities. In an effort to demonstrate the innovative elements of the new Convention and to encourage states to ratify it, chapter four surveys the main benefits that have accrued to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its national air carrier upon ratification of the 1999 Montreal Convention.</description><creator>Alhoudail, Mamdouh Ali.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Aeronautics, Commercial -- Law and legislation.</subject><subject>Liability for aircraft accidents.</subject><title>Air carrier liability : unfinished unification of private international air law</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Mamdouh Ali Alhoudail, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nz806005t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kh04dp97g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:np193947n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Aviation and the internet are two conveniences without which the modern world would almost grind to a halt given our current dependence levels (on them). If both were to suddenly vanish, mankind would be thrown back to the late 19th century reminiscent of a world which was once a smaller place. Aviation plays a critical role in our daily life transporting man and material over vast distances in a relatively short period of time. A vital cog in this wheel is the airport that 'facilitates' the safe loading, unloading, take-off and landing of aircraft. For some time now, aircraft have been the target of various terrorist groups and militant factions seeking to make a point to the world in the most dramatic fashion possible. To maintain the security of civil aviation, laws have been promulgated (both nationally and internationally) to ensure that the perpetrators (of the crime) when caught, will be adequately punished and in a manner that will deter others from committing crimes against civil aviation. However this law-making process (in large part initiated by the International Civil Aviation Organization) has not sufficiently addressed airports and the security therein. This paper seeks to examine---and in some cases suggest improvements to---aviation security laws at large, with a specific emphasis on airports. It is believed that a more comprehensive set of laws governing aviation security would result in greater efficacy of airport security procedures thus reducing the need for prospective judicial intervention and concomitant lengthy court proceedings.</description><creator>Acharya, Gautam.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Airports -- Security measures.</subject><subject>Aeronautics -- Safety measures.</subject><title>Legal aspects of aviation security measures taken at airports</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Gautam Acharya, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3f462576z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/np193947n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9z903016k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In light of increased demands for security, we propose a unique approach to automated video surveillance using anomaly detection. The success of this approach is dependent on the ability of the system to ascertain the novelty of a given image acquired by a video camera. We adopt a compression-based similarity measure to determine similarity between images in a video sequence. Images that are sufficiently similar to the previously-seen images are discarded; conversely, images that are sufficiently dissimilar are stored for comparison with future incoming images. The use of a compression-based technique inherently reduces the heavy computational and storage demands that other video surveillance applications typically have placed on the system. In order to further reduce the computational and storage load, the anomaly detection algorithm is applied to edges and people, which are image features that have been extracted from the images acquired by the camera.</description><creator>Au, Carmen E.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Compression-based anomaly detection for video surveillance applications</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Carmen E.

It examines the representation of Islam in relation to African women's identity, with particular emphasis on its relationship with the postcolonial context of francophone West Africa. Chapter I reviews the emergence of African francophone literature by women authors and the trends of criticism that developed as a result of it. It also presents the theoretical framework of this research, namely feminist and postcolonial theories inspired by Frantz Fanon and African women theorists. Chapter II of this thesis explores the use of Sufi imagery in Cendres et braises and its metaphorical description of decolonization and of the postcolonial subject. Chapter III examines Comme le bon pain for Islamic elements and their interaction with African traditional beliefs, as it attempts to understand Ndoye's own attitude towards Islam. It briefly reviews definitions of syncretism and what was termed "African Islam." Chapter IV poses the question of whether the two novels can be inscribed within a feminist ideology, specifically in a postcolonial, West African and Muslim context.</description><creator>Traoré, Fatoumata Diahara.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Bugul, Ken.

It explores the forces responsible for shaping the church at the time of its construction and decoration in the sixth century. The basilica had gained popularity of usage as a model for the Christian Church in the West by this time. This thesis further explores the conclusions put forth by scholars that the basilica was the forum in which the transition of architectural imperial symbolism from the pagan empire to the new Christian Church took place, that the Church adopted the court ceremony of the emperor for its liturgy, and that the symbolism previously associated with the emperor was transferred to Christ resulting in the identification of the basilica as the throne hall of Christ.

In contrast to many post-industrial nations, Nigeria boasts a vibrant civil society but seems to possess little attitudinal social capital. A deeper understanding of this relationship is offered by considering how an association's structure influences members' attitudes and how this relationship is impacted by a repressive regime. These relationships are tested using both statistical data and a qualitative study of three associations. The findings support the hypothesis that certain structural characteristics are more conducive to the fostering of attitudinal social capital but that the presence of state repression undermines this process. Furthermore, it is shown that pro-democracy associations are essential in creating the space necessary for trust and cooperation between citizens, even when they do not foster these norms amongst their own membership.</description><creator>Thiele, Sarah.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Nigeria -- Social conditions.</subject><subject>Social capital (Sociology) -- Nigeria.</subject><subject>Nigeria -- Politics and government.</subject><title>Social capital and state repression in Nigeria</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Sarah Thiele, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tm70mv47z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/02870w13c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1c18dg07w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Defense Style Questionnaire (DSQ) is a self-report instrument designed to measure defensive functioning and coping styles. Originally developed by Bond and colleagues (1983), the questionnaire has been researched extensively. The present investigation sought to determine the factor validity of the newly developed DSQ-60 (Trijsburg, Bond &amp; Drapeau, 2003) in a sample of English-speaking university students (n = 305) and French-speaking university students (n = 212).

Biggs' 3P model (Biggs, &amp; Moore, 1993) provided the framework for qualitatively categorizing 26 student teachers' (16 female, 10 male) conceptions of meaningful learning, and allocations of responsibility for learning. Categories were tested for independence and subsequently predicted learning outcomes as identified by Bloom's revised taxonomy (Anderson, &amp; Krathwohl, 2001). All students held qualitative conceptions of learning. Participants who attributed responsibility to both the professor and students understood and applied course content more than those who attributed responsibility to either solely the professor or student on measures of understanding and application. Results lend support for Biggs' 3P model of classroom systems.</description><creator>Redden, Krista Corinne.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Constructivism (Education)</subject><subject>Teachers -- Training of.</subject><subject>Learning.</subject><title>Constructive alignment in teacher education : identifying contextually dependent student presage factors and associated learning outcomes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Krista Corinne Redden, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9g54xh95n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m039k520m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1v53jx311</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>During the 1970s, Gianni Celati uses his novels as a workshop for his investigation into language, literature and communication. Le avventure di Guizzardi, La banda dei sospiri and Lunario del paradiso are crucial works in which Celati develops a style based on oral language as a way of bringing life closer to art and escaping the self-referentiality of the literary vanguard. Celati also experiments with a poetics of "ordinariness," both in style and content, as a means of broadening his audience and the reach of his social commentary. An examination of Celati's novels of this period reveal an intellectual that is critical of the ways that society uses literature and language to further disenfranchise its weakest members. He invites intellectuals to re-examine of the value of language and literature, but also ordinary people to become writers themselves so that new voices may be heard.</description><creator>Powers, Monica.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Celati, Gianni, 1937- -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><title>Developing a poetics of ordinariness : language, literature and communication in Gianni Celati's Le avventure di Guizzardi, La banda dei sospiri and Lunario del paradiso</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Monica Powers, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9019s2796.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1v53jx311</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Italian</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bv73c0819</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The decline thesis proposes that political participation among young people has declined steadily and alarmingly since the 1960s. New research proposes that young people have not been simply abstaining from political participation but that they have been engaging in new or alternative forms of participation like demonstrating, signing petitions and expressing themselves politically in the market. This paper asks two questions---who are these alternative participators and what explains why they have turned to these new forms? The results indicate that young people engage with alternative forms of political participation more than they engage with more traditional forms like joining political parties and lobbying Congress. Furthermore, the results show that the theory of postmaterialism does explain in part what leads some young people to participate in these alternative forms more than others.</description><creator>Roberts, Ayanna.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Political alienation -- United States.</subject><subject>Young adults -- United States -- Political activity.</subject><subject>Political participation -- United States.</subject><title>Protesting the polls : how postmaterialism affects political articipation in young people</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Ayanna Roberts, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h702q663d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bv73c0819</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1v53jx30r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The goal of this thesis is a critical edition of the Secrets des femmes, a text attributed to Arnold de Vilanova. In the exegetic tradition, this attribution has been widely argued. Our preliminary findings lead to the same conclusions. The text composed in French couldn't have been written by Vilanova, who would have composed it in Latin, the language of the "clerks", or in Catalan, his first language. Critical tradition shows that the Secrets des femmes is based on three manuscripts. But we have demonstrated that the Mazarine's manuscript is not at the base of this work, but rather of a text entitled Les Termes et secrets des femmes. For the critical edition, which is the objective of our study, there is no doubt that the Arsenal's text is the basic manuscript, while the Vatican's manuscript is the Arsenal's metalanguage.</description><creator>Préfontaine, Jennifer.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Gynecology -- Early works to 1800.</subject><subject>Obstetrics -- Early works to 1800.</subject><title>Secrets des femmes</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Jennifer Préfontaine, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3f4625777.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1v53jx30r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pr76f3734</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study explored the relationship between psychotherapists' personality and choice of theoretical orientation. A total of 493 participants (274 practitioners and 219 students) completed a web-based survey. Personality was assessed using the HEXACO Personality Inventory (HEXACO-PI; Lee &amp; Ashton, 2004) while theoretical orientation preference was assessed using a modified version of the Theoretical Orientation Profile Scale-Revised (TOPS-R; Worthington &amp; Dillon, 2003). In the practitioner sample, the Humanistic/Existential scale was found to be significantly correlated with the Openness Unconventionality scale (r = .34). Results further revealed that practitioners' theoretical orientation preference differed based on the Conscientiousness and Openness personality dimensions. In the student sample, the cognitive-behavioural orientation was significantly correlated with Conscientiousness ( r = .37) and the Conscientiousness Prudence facet scale (r =.36). The humanistic/existential scale was significantly related to Openness ( r = .34) and the Openness Creativity subscale (r = .35). Results further indicated that students' theoretical orientation preferences were different based on the Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness personality dimensions. Lastly, results showed that students' theoretical orientation preferences were significantly related to their supervisors'. Implications for future research, training, and practice are discussed.</description><creator>Ogunfowora, Babatunde O.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Psychotherapy -- Philosophy.</subject><subject>Psychotherapists -- Psychology.</subject><title>A study on the relationship between psychotherapists' personality profiles and their theoretical orientation preferences /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Babatunde O.

Performance was defined in terms of reaction times and error rates during novel computerized tasks that measured sequential and numerical concepts related to cardinality and ordinal knowledge. Analyses revealed that fast and accurate performance was attributable to children at older ages. At younger ages, task manipulations exclusively related to ordinal relationships demonstrated a significant influence over error rates. Furthermore, nonverbal intelligence predicted a significant amount of the variance related to an understanding of the ordinal properties of numbers. The findings support developmental theory regarding age-related changes in early mathematical performance and extend pedagogical research concerning the cognitive capacities that contribute to approximate numerical knowledge.</description><creator>Ostfield, Danielle.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Intellect.</subject><subject>Mathematical ability.</subject><subject>Cognition in children.</subject><title>The typical developmental trajectory of early numerical concepts : the relationship between approximate arithmetic and nonverbal intelligence across childhood</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Danielle Ostfield, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2227mp998.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4t64gn44c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:d791sg608</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study arises out of research on teacher beliefs and practice with regard to the social, political and economic conditions affecting English Language Learners (ELLS). Specifically, it examines how student-teachers in an introductory course to cross-cultural education at a state university in California reflect on their own beliefs about cultural, linguistic, racial, ethnic and socio-economic diversity; whether they examine the socio-political context of schooling language minority students; their beliefs about appropriate strategies and methodologies for ELLs; and if and how these beliefs have been influenced by the course. Forty-two student-teachers completed pre- and post-course questionnaires, and two completed interviews. The results from this study show that teacher education coursework can change teacher beliefs about issues of diversity in positive ways and can lead to greater teacher awareness about the socio-political context of schooling ELLs. The next step in the research agenda will be to investigate how teacher beliefs about multicultural issues affect their practices in teaching ELLs.</description><creator>Nikolov, Lensi.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>English language -- Study and teaching -- Foreign speakers.</subject><subject>Teachers -- Training of.</subject><subject>Multicultural education.</subject><title>Multicultural education coursework in a CLAD credential program : how are teachers of English language learners affected?</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Lensi Nikolov, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/41687h72g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d791sg608</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Second Language Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nk322d538</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis explores the relations between the Druze emir Fakhr al-Din II Ma'n and three successive Medici Grand Dukes between 1605 and 1633. Eschewing traditional historiographical concerns with the origins of Lebanese nationalism and the cultural encounter between East and West, I have sought first and above all to locate relations between this powerful emir and the Court of Tuscany within the broader context of Mediterranean history. I suggest that the actions of Fakhr al-Din and of the Medici Grand Dukes have to be understood in relation to broad, long-term trends in the economic and social history of the Mediterranean. I explore two of these trends in detail: the breakdown in commercial and diplomatic relations between Florence (and then Tuscany) and the Ottoman empire during the course of the sixteenth century; the bargaining between the Porte and provincial power-holders in the Syrian provinces in the century following the Ottoman conquest.</description><creator>Olsaretti, Alessandro.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Tuscany (Italy) -- History -- 1434-1737.</subject><subject>Medici, House of.</subject><subject>Fakhr al-Dīn II, Emir of Lebanon, 1572-1635.</subject><subject>Lebanon -- History -- 1516-1918.</subject><title>Trade, diplomacy and state formation in the early modern Mediterranean : Fakhr al-Dīn II, the Sublime Porte and the court of Tuscany</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Alessandro Olsaretti, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gt54kn401.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nk322d538</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Islamic Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:b8515n66f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis examines the visual images of Vimalakirti, an ancient Indian lay Buddhist, painted on the walls of the Buddhist cave complex at Dunhuang, Gansu province, between 581 and 1036. The sixty-nine Vimalakirti, paintings preserved at Dunhuang are a valuable source for the exploration of historical, religious, and artistic dimensions of wall paintings and sutras. These visual images, together with other textual sources such as sutras, commentaries, and inscriptions, suggest a variety of interesting questions: Why was this theme repeatedly represented? Do the images all have the same prototype? Is there a spiritual function contained in the layout of the caves and composition of the wall paintings? Did the meaning of these images change according to historical context? Did the patrons have a political scheme in mind when commissioning these devotional artworks? While it is difficult to provide definitive answers to all these questions, this thesis will attempt to clarify them and offer preliminary answers on the basis of available visual and textual sources. The introduction of this thesis includes an overview of basic concepts related to wall paintings, a short history of the transmission of the Vimalakirti,-nirdesa Sutra, and a review of past scholarship on Vimalakirti, paintings and related subjects. The body of the thesis is divided into three main chapters. The first chapter describes the important visual representations of Vimalakirti, before the Sui dynasty. The second chapter of the thesis will provide an introduction to representations of Vimalakirti, at Dunhuang from the late sixth to the early eleventh centuries. The third chapter examines the social functions and symbolic meanings of the Vimalakirti, paintings at Dunhuang.</description><creator>Lin, Fan, 1972-</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Dunhuang Caves (China)</subject><subject>Mural painting and decoration, Chinese -- China -- Dunhuang.</subject><subject>Buddhist art -- China.</subject><title>Visual images of Vimalakīrti in the Mogao caves (581-1036)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Fan Lin, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sf2685446.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b8515n66f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of East Asian Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gm80hv60r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:23:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis illustrates a general sense of national identity within the Taiwanese people brought on by the Kuomintang (KMT) and existing throughout the KMT's reign over the island, and contrasts this with the new identity that came to exist in the post-KMT period.

The paper begins with a survey of the study of Bible as literature and Midrash as literature, examining the work of Robert Alter, Meir Sternberg, Wesley A. Kort, Isaak Heinemann, Ofra Meir, David Stern and Jacob Neusner. Following this is a close reading and poetic analysis of the two primary texts, then a summary and comparison of narrative conventions and techniques. Narrative is examined according to the considerations of plot, character, narration and meaning. Further conclusions are drawn regarding the different portrayal of God in biblical and midrashic discourse, attitudes toward paradox and ambiguity, and strategies for achieving ideological and rhetorical goals.</description><creator>Lesk, Joshua.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Cain (Biblical figure)</subject><subject>Abel (Biblical figure)</subject><title>A comparison of narrative in Genesis and Genesis Rabbah : the Cain and Abel story</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Joshua Lesk, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3f462578h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0r967398g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Jewish Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1n79h472z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:24:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is an analysis of two film soundtracks, High Fidelity and Rushmore, and how each conforms to, and moves away from, trends in soundtrack production. The analysis begins by examining the relationship between film and music through the progression of key figures and moments leading to the current state of the film soundtrack. The soundtracks of High Fidelity and Rushmore are situated within the contexts of youth and rock culture as a means of illuminating their compilations and prospective audiences. The conclusion of this thesis is that these particular films and their soundtracks are entrenched in a dialogue about nostalgia and the superiority of archival music and provide clear examples of the growing use of nostalgia within cultural contexts generally.</description><creator>Levy, Michelle.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Film soundtracks -- History and criticism.</subject><title>Nostalgia and renewal : the soundtracks of Rushmore and High Fidelity</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Michelle Levy, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bz60cw48b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1n79h472z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):26775</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
