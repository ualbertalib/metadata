While the first two are important, the subject of swarm control opens up a discussion which generally develops into a lengthy debate. There is a tremendous amount of literature on the subject, advocating various manipulations to subdue this propensity, yet the average beekeeper is groping in the dark for a method that will best suit his needs. The writer's stimulus for investigation, although largely for educational purposes, was also from a mercenary origin. Having seven commercial apiaries consisting of about four hundred oolonies, and also being in charge of the experimental apiaries at the 0.A. College, Guelph, he found himself confronted with the above problem.

While it is true that some fermentations are benefitted by viscocity as in the formation of Dutch "lange-Wei", used as a starter in the manufacture of Edam cheese, of "taettemaelk" (thick milk) of Norway and of "Filmjolk" (stringy milk) of Sweden and Finland, it is generally considered that, for the most part, such fermentations were destructive, and resulted in the spoilage of the product concerned.

One would be justified in saying that it marked also the birth of experimental science, for agriculture was indeed the earliest of empirical sciences, and is based on the accumulated wisdom and experience of a hundred centuries of practical experimentation. In récent years agricultural practice has been subjected to critical scientific examination, and, in the majority of cases, it has been found to be in accord with the laws of physics, chemistry, botany, physiology and microbiology. These sciences have served to improve modem agriculture and have succeeded in setting it on a level with other applied and industrial sciences of the day. Microbiological investigation has shown that many common agricultural practices are designed to promote certain beneficiai microbial processes in the soil, and these processes have been submitted in recent years to a great deal of bacteriological experimentation.

It is rather remarkable that England who had played such a prominent part in fostering steam traction, contributed nothing of importance to the early development of internal combustion engines. Nor did her people adopt with readiness the new type of vehicle.But stranger perhaps it is that the United States, now recognized as controlling the world's production, was equally unfruitful. The automobile really owes its inception to thepre-existemce of a cheap and reliable fuel supply. Gasoline, prior to its utilization as a source of power was a little thought-of by-product of crude oil and was used almostexclusively for cleaning purposes and in necessarily small quantities. The potentialities of this hydrocarbon were easily recognizable. Being clean, inexpensive and light in weight, it embodied all the desirable features of coal or wood with practically none of their drawbacks. The new power-plant then was no chance invention, but was the expression of an effort to harness this liquid form of power.

The discovery by Hellriegel and Wi1farth (7) that leguminous p1ants in symbiotic re1at1on with bacteria secured nitrogen from the air and stored it in nodules on their roots explained the effect that had been observed by many previous investigators, that oertain plants made much stronger growth a£ter leguminous crops. We now know from the work done by Russel (11) and others that other forms of soil organisms also increase the supply of nitrogen in thesoi1 when conditions are favorable. The forage crops that are grown for their stems, 1eaves and roots require large quantities of nitrogenous food during their early growth. This can be secured by having them follow leguminous crops and by applying manure rich in nitrogen. The cereal crops that require a larger proportion of phosphates can be placed to advantage following the rank growing forage crops which use up the abundanoe of free nitrates from the clover sod and the farmyard manure.

Schiff (1867) was the first to show that the stimulation of the splanchnic nerves and of the coeliac ganglion causes contraction of the spleen.Bulgak (1877) found that stimulation of anterior root fibres over a considerable extent of the thoracic cord causes contraction of the spleen by way of the great splanchnic nerve. Roy (1881) introduced the plethysmograph for study of splenic contraction. He observed that the organ is normally subject to regular alternation of volume, in virtue of which it acts as a pump. Schafer and Moore (1896), using Roy's plethysmographic teohnique, were able to confirm and to extend many of Bulgak's results.

When Henry V111 died in 1547 and young Edward VI ascended the throne, England had undergone a great change touching the final authority in civil and religious questions. The issue was whether the Pope or the King was to be the final authority in the realm. Henry settled the question in the beginning of the second half of his reign and the results were far reaching. Henry had been educated for the Church but upon the death" of his father and brother he married his sister-in-law Catherine of Aragon, and ascended the throne with the brightest of prospects for his future and that of his kingdom. During the first half of his reign, he distinguished himself in the service of the church, and the Pope, in recognition conferred upon him the title of "Defensor Fidei."

Today, however, we know as also the rest of the world knows, that the finest quality wheat in the world is produoed north of this boundary, in the three prairie provinoes of Canada, and the area of wheat production is still extending northwards. Within more recent years a belief paralleling that already mentioned existed in regard to the growing of corn. It is but a very short time ago that the belief held that corn oould not be grown successfully as far north as the international boundary. But once again Scienoe has prevailed and has overoome the obstacles set up in her path by Nature, for we have today thousands upon thousands of acres devoted to the production of corn each year in the Canadian Prairie provinces and the acreage is steadily increasing.

These authors injected an aqueous extract of the whole gland into an anaesthetized animal and obtained a rise in blood pressure. Later, in 1898, Howell (2) localized this pressor activity in the posterior lobe of the gland. Subsequent investigations have shown that extracts of the posterior lobe have physiological activities which manifest themselves on the cardio-vascular, renal, smooth muscle, and glandular structures of the body. The most important of these activities are generally held to be thepressor, oxytocic, and renal actions, or, as the latter is sometimes termed, diuretic-antidiuretic. As the experiments reported in this paper deal with the unity or multiplicity of the constituents responsible for these three activities, a resume' of the history and present state of our knowledge concerning them is given below.

I have not given the biographical facts of writers resident in Canada, but only of those who have left their home land and are too frequently considered natives of other countries. I do not presume to speak with finality. After all, in drama as well as in all forms of literature, time is the supreme test, and either fortunately or unfortunately, a graduate student does not belong to that aristocracy of time, by which a work of art is ultimately judged. Canada has been so busy building her house, hewing it, as it were from a wilderness, that she has had little time to decorate it. Statements are frequently made, however, that Canada has produced neither playwright, play nor player. This is not justified by the facts. What I have tried to do in this discussion, is to examine that statement and to disprove it, by evidence, some of which has been exceedingly difficult to obtain.

Being the first part of south-eastern Quebec to be surveyed after the English manner, it was divided into counties, townships, ranges and lots instead of into seigniories, and parishes, according to the custom that prevailed during the French rule in Canada. Thus the distr is generally known as the "Eastern Townships." These early surveyors instead of dividing the district symmetrically into rectangular areas, split up the oountry in a most complicated, and irregular manner. Then, as if not satisfied with the puzale already created, they proceeded to number the ranges and lots in a still less systematic manner. The compiling of maps, particularly on small scale, is thus rendered slow and tedious. [...]</description><creator>Ellis, David H.</creator><contributor>Graham, R. &amp; Adams, F.

Although this product has been exported in varying quantities since the introduction of mechanical refrigeration on steamships in 1897, the period of rapid growth prior to the war steadily reduced the volume available for export, until in 1913 this country imported six times as much as she exported. More recently, there has been a decided increase in butter production, not only in Ontario and Quebec, but also in the three Prairie Provinces. In the latter, the phenomenal growth of the dairy industry can be attributed largely to the development of a system of mixed farming, as a result of the poor returns from grain-growing after 1920. Thus these provinces, which not long ago imported butter, now manufacture nearly as much as is made in Ontario. Unlike the latter province, these provinces have few industrial centres to provide a home market, and are forced to seek a market for any surplus farther afield.
