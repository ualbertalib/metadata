The use of modern cytological techniques has made possible detailed studies of fungus nuclei with important consequences in the fields of cytotaxonomy and cytogenetics in particular.

The same problem is encountered in the important tomato-producing areas in the south during the summer. In extreme cases, crop failures have been reported (Went 1957). The poor setting in apparently healthy tomato plants has been shown to depend largely upon the climatic conditions at the time of pollination. Low light intensity, short photoperiod, and high night temperatures may all be limiting factors.</description><creator>Hassan, Soheir. H.</creator><contributor>Taper, C.

Since there are many natural chemical constituents present in plants which may be used in systematic studies many techniques for their analysis have been devised. The advent of paper chromatography in 1944, followed by the development of such techniques as electrophoresis, thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography, which enables the separation of a wide range of compounds in a relatively short time, has removed the difficulty of isolating many biochemical compounds which had been the main drawback to this type of study in the past.</description><creator>Harney, Patricia.

Using the circuit, the time characteristics of the beta-ray Orange Spectrometer are determined to be such that for most coincidence measurements the lower limit of resolution will be determined primarily by the photomultipliers and scintillators, and not the spectrometer. A method for calculating the electron path lengths - and so, times of flight - which can be applied to spectrometers of this type is outlined and tested. The circuit provides a ready means for measuring the time characteristics of the avalanche transistor itself, and such a study is made. On this basis it is shown that the coincidence only “sees” the photomultiplier pulse for that instant at which it reaches a certain predetermined voltage.</description><creator>Hardy, John.

In 1924 Warburg reported that rat brain cortex slices incubated in a glucose-Ringer medium yielded an oxygen quotient (Qo2) of 10.7. Though higher rates have been recorded for the Qo2 of brain cortex slices in normal physiological media, these values have invariably been round to be lower than those calculated for the brain in vivo. Elliott estimating the respiratory rates of the whole brain invitro found that they approximate the rates observed in vivo in conditions of diminished functional activity.</description><creator>Haber, Andrew.

Employing the isolated guinea pig atrium and ileum, this study shows that phenoxybenzamine is a patent and specific atropine-like agent. Chlorpromazine is less patent than phenoxybenzamine, and other adrenaline antagonists - phentolamine, prosympal, and yohimbine – are even less patent than chlorpromazine. The work originated from observations that phenoxybenzamine reverses the effect of vagal stimulation on the isolated guinea pig atrium so that stimulation instead of inhibition occurs (Benfey and Greeff, 1961).</description><creator>Grillo, Samuel.

The purpose of making the analysis was two-fold: 1. To compare the composition of garnets from diamond-bearing, with those from non diamond-bearing kimberlites. 2. To evaluate the results of analysis by physical methods, by comparing them with the results of chemical analyses. Analyses by physical methods were made by measuring the refractive indices, the lattice constants and the specific gravities of the garnets and plotting them, along with chemical composition, on a three dimensional tetrahedral diagram (after Winchell, 1958). No difference was found between the garnets from diamond bearing and those from non diamond-bearing kimberlites.

New recording techniques are being introduced every year, and the accuracy of this method increases with improvement in instrumentation. The kidney lends itself well to this technique, as its major job is to concentrate various substances from the blood, and excrete them in the urine. Therefore hippuran, an end product of metabolism, and neohydrin, a foreign compound, are rapidly removed from the circulation, and concentrated in the kidney. "Tagging" these substances with radio-active isotopes, makes the detection of their distribution in the body easy by means of external counting techniques.</description><creator>Goodwin, David.

It is shown that the apparatus of this experiment operates in a manner similar to one of the models considered by them. The relative importance of the various theoretical parameters is shown through an experimental study carried out for this purpose. It was found that the most relevant parameters for the resolution obtained using a given scintillation materiel were the time spread in the photomultiplier and the pulse height, while the photon collection time spread had little effect. From the results of this study the minimum resolution of the apparatus was improved to 2x10^-10 sec.

Lying partly beneath the uncus, and beside the hippocampus, it becomes blended with the grey matter on its infero-medial aspect, and with the lentiform nucleus dorsally. The differentiation of the various nuclei within the amygdala has remained essentially unchanged from marsupials to man. The study of more primitive animals, however, shows a phylogenetic division into a primitive centromedial group and a more recent basolateral group (Johnson, 1923; Koikegami, Fuse, Yokoyama, Watanabe, &amp; Watanabe, 1955). The centromedial group is composed of the central and medial nuclei and the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract. The small-celled medial portion of the basal nucleus is also sometimes included.</description><creator>Goddard, Graham. V.</creator><contributor>Milner, P.

It has been shown that sulphur is needed in amounts of the same order as phosphorus, even greater sometimes, by most crops. An investigation of the sulphur status of Quebec soils was initiated at Macdonald College in 1957. Particular attention was paid to the methods of total sulphur and sulphate determination. It was concluded (58) that no signs of deficiency seemed to occur in these soils. The distribution of sulphur in soil profiles has been studied by various workers (30, 70, 74). Relatively high sulphate contents in subsoils have been found (30) and the availability of this sulphur to plants was demonstrated.</description><creator>Ghanem, Ibrahim.

It was known for a long time that after exposure and recovery from an infectious disease one usually did not contract it again. In 1798 Jenner performed the first successful immunization against smallpox and his vaccination procedure is still used today. Kraus (2) observed that resistance could be developed not only by exposure to the intact bacteria, but also to their extracts or toxins. Later it was shown that the introduction of a foreign substance into an animal induced the formation of globular serum proteins, which possessed the unique property of reacting specifically with the foreign substance.</description><creator>Froese, Arnold.</creator><contributor>Sehon, A.

It may express itself by alterations in structure, function, or a combination of both. The structural alterations may be visible to the naked eye, such as greying, baldness and wrinkling of the skin. Others are more subtle and may only be seen with the microscope, such as neuronal degeneration in the cerebral cortex; and still ethers cannot be seen when examined by present methods. Examples of functional alterations that may occur with age are presbyopia, presbycusis and a fall in the lung diffusing capacity (17).</description><creator>Frank, Harold.</creator><contributor>Christie, R.

The proportions, however, of rural to urban concerns, are different for the literary and the social historian. The social historian may properly begin with the French regime in the early seventeenth century, proceed to the British Conquest in 1763, and on to the effects of the American Revolution in 1775, and through to Confederation in 1867 and to the establishment of “The Railway” and the opening up of the Canadian West, all this time - nearly three hundred years of history - being concerned mainly with topics related to a predominantly rural mode of life.</description><creator>Francis, Wynne.</creator><contributor>Dudek, L.

If X and Y are triangulable manifolds of dimensions m and n respectively, and if Q(X) is isomorphic to Q(Y), then m=n. (Q(X) is the maximal ring of quotients of the ring of all continuous real valued functions defined on X.) The contents of the thesis is divided into three parts. In the first, we prove some general propositions, which will be needed later. In the second part, we prove that, if X and Y are triangulable manifolds such that the dimension of X is 1 and Q(X) is isomorphic to Q(Y), then the dimension of Y is also 1.</description><creator>Fortin, Jacques.

The most important factors being the resistance of the rocks to weathering and erosion, and the tectonic activity, both local and regional, to which they have been subjected. These are the factors which, under the tropical conditions obtaining, control to a large extent the development of the various landforms characteristic of the area. In general, the views outlined are those at present accepted by the geologists working in the area. No radically new ideas with respect to rock type, lithologies, or stratigraphic sequences are presented. Much of the tectonic history however has been deduced from photogeomorphologic evidence and may not agree entirely with presently held views.</description><creator>Erb, David.

Turner (1) obtained by catalytic hydrogenation of 5-oxo-3,5- seco-A-norcholestane-3-oic acid (lIa) (2), two lactones, m.p. 116-116.5°C and m.p. 109.5-110°C, the latter in large amount. He provisionally assigned to these compounds the structures IXa and VIIIa respectively because of their optical rotations and because hydrogenation of 4- oxacholest-5-en-3-one (IIIa) (3), which should be expected to give lactone IXa, gave the higher melting isomer.</description><creator>Ferland, Jean-Marie.</creator><contributor>Edward, J.

One is quite liable to fall victim to his own prejudices, pre-conceived opinion, likes and dislikes, and, -to use a Marxist concept, to be influenced by one's own social and economic background. This task, however, becomes even more difficult if we consider that the present Hungarian regime and its official organs abroad never are overanxious to publish the truth. Moreover the history of Hungary, and especially the history of the Hungarian Labour movement is, from time-to-time, re-written according to the psychological demands of the current political order. Consequently, it would not be difficult for an effort such as this to fail within a very short time after its conception.</description><creator>Feledy, Julius. A.</creator><contributor>Mladenovic, M.

Investigations concerned with the problem of PMD were inaugurated in the Department of Biochemistry, at McGill University in 1957. From the time of its inauguration to the present, the various aspects of this research program have been under the direction of Dr. E. A. Hosein. PMD, in humans, is characterized by the degeneration and atrophy of striated muscle (1), and is accompanied by a number of non-specific biochemical abnormalities which have been shown by numerous investigators to extend to several different aspects of normal muscle metabolism (2-11).</description><creator>Eisenstein, Sam.</creator><contributor>Hosein, E.
