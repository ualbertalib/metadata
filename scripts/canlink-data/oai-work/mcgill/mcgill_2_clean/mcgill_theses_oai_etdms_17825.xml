However, it is only in recent years thot extensive aerial photography has been undertaken, and this, together wlth certain military and economie developments within the peninsule, has led to an increasing awareness of the significance of the glacial history of the a rea. These developments led ultimately to the establishment in 1954, of the McGi Il Sub-Arctic Research La bora tory, through which it was proposed to develop a scientific research programme related to this little known a rea. With the establishment of the Laboratory, a Field Director was appointed by McGill University to supervise the studies of the younger workers on the staff. A natural outcome of the system was for an emphasis to develop along the lin es of the research interests of the senior man. Under the direction of Dr. J. D. Ives the system developed into what Matthew (196la) has termed the 1 McGill Programme in relation to the deglaciation of the peninsula.

These characteristics are the result of distinct geomorphic and geophysical processes operating in late glacial and post glacial times and therefore a study of these characteristics reveals certain facts about the glacierization of Labrador-Ungava* and the deglaci erization of Southwest Labrador. The tilt of the glacial lake shoreline features is a result of glacial isostatic recovery and therefore the tilt of the shorelines reflects the differentiai thickness of the laurentide lee Sheet over Southwest Labrador during a certain stage in the Wisconsin period. If tilts of shorelines in other areas are used in conjunction with the tilts from Southwest Labrador it is possible to locate a point which represents a centre of ice dispersal of the Laurentide lee Sheet during a certain stage in the Wisconsin period.</description><creator>Harrison, David Alan.</creator><contributor>Bird, J.

The present thesis has thus a two-fold objective: a general and a specifie purpose. The general purpose is to contribute to the body of anthropological knowledge wbich concerna itself with the understanding of the processes of culture change and culture growth. Such knowledge is essential to the planning and effective implementation of governmental policies among these people. The specifie purpose will be to descr!be and analyze some aspects of the process of culture change, or acculturation, among the Montagnais Indiana of the seven Islands band of the Quebec-Labrador region of canada.

Low. Despite this knowledge the peninsula has received very little attention until recently, due undoubtedly to its inaccessibility, and to the practical difficulties of field research in the subarctic environment. Until about 1945 the studies of glacial geomorphology that had been completed ( with the exception of the early work of Low) were almost entirely confined to the coastal regions, in particular to the Atlantic coast of Labrador. The most significant scientific contribution was that of Tanner, who visited the coast of Labrador in 1937 and 1939. The investigations of Tanner and his colleagues, and Tanner (1944) synthesis of the reports of earlier geologists were published in a summary of the glaciations of the entire peninsula, which remains the standard regional reference to this day. Inevitably, with the meagre, and o:tten not entirely accurate information of the interior parts of Labrador Ungava there is a marked contrast in the degree to which detailed evidence is available to the glacial geomorphologist, attempting to decipher the details of glaciation over the whole peninsula.</description><creator>Matthew, Edward Michael.</creator><date>1961</date><subject>Glacial epoch -- Québec (Province) -- George River Region.</subject><subject>Geomorphology -- Québec (Province) -- George River Region.</subject><title>The glacial geomorphology and deglacierization of the George River Basin and adjacent areas in Northern Quebec.</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9c67wr52f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kd17cx947</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jw827g554</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:23:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Until recently the tumor process has been regarded as a one-step cause and effect event.

Three views have been put forward concerning this regulation; a) that ACTH secretion is controlled by the systemic blood level of adrenaline; b) that its secretion is controlled and regulated by the systemic blood level of adrenal cortical hormones and; c) it may be controlled by the hypothalamus via the hypophysial portal vessels (1).

Among the psychological studies that have employed physiological techniques one can distinguish two rather different approaches: one aims at discovering the physiological mechanisms underlying behavior, while the other has borrowed the methods of physiology to obtain additional variables for observation.

In the case of the neurohypophysis and the adrenal medulla this control is probably direct, as both these glands are richly innervated. On the other hand the control exerted by the central nervous system over the adenohypophysis and thereby the gonads, thyroid and adrenal cortex is incompletely understood (1), but the evidence points to a neurohumoral type of control (1). From the work of Harris and ethers it appears, that both the hypothalamus and the neurohypophysis are involved in the integration of the activity of the adenohypophysis.</description><creator>Schally, Andrew.

Recent work on these organisms has revealed that they are particularly favourable organisms for studying the physiology and morphology of differentiation. The term "slime mould” commonly refers to the members of four different groups of organisms; the Labyrinthulales, the Acrasiales, the Myxogastrales or Myxomycetes, and the Plasmodiophorales. With the exception of the Plasmodiophorales, the members of these groups are non-parasitic in higher plants.</description><creator>Ross, Ian. K.</creator><contributor>Wilson, C.

It is a question to which very divergent answers have been made by a great variety of people. Not infrequently untutored individuals have held views at wide variance with men of vast learning; of men of erudition themselves it would seem true to say that there has never been unanimity of belief; and, if of bygone centuries it be true that no common point of view regarding miracles received assent, it is equally true to affirm that in our own time there is a like disparity of opinion.</description><creator>Rogers, Allison.

Their first practice was to fill paper bags with hot air, which ascended by the thermodynamic force produced. Following their original discovery, they made larger and larger bags until they eventually evolved a great balloon which was capable of carrying a man into the air. Development was so rapid that within ten years from the first successful man-carrying ascent, balloons were successfully employed in warfare by the French, against the Austrians in 1794 at Maubeuge, in the battle of Fleures.</description><creator>Rippon, Clive.

In this, no easy pattern can be followed, because of the many factors influencing the settlement of the Island. Its geographical location made it a resting place for explorers, and provided harbours for whaling fleets of earlier years. Trading posts were placed by the Hudson' s Bay Company at accessible points along the coast, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police has, in recent years, established stations at four localities.</description><creator>Riley, George.

For administrative purposes, Transjordan was included in the province (vilayet) of Syria which itself was divided into 4 districts (sanjaks). After the defeat of the Turks in 1918, the Ottoman Empire disintigrated and Emir Faisal, son of Sherif Hussein ruler of the Hejaz, was proclaimed King on March 8th 1920. This, however, conflicted with the policy of the Allies as revealed by the Sykes-Picot secret Agreement concluded in the spring of 1916 and which contemplated the division of that area into spheres of influence.</description><creator>Rezek, Gabriel.
