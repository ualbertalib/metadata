The toxicity and mobility of a trace element are affected by the element's solubility, which in turn is influenced by the soil properties. When mobile, trace elements can be leached out of the soil. If leaching occurs at a faster rate than atmospheric deposition, element concentrations in the soil will decrease by natural attenuation. We analyzed soil properties in 40 soils and their soil solutions to obtain a set of equations with the most significant predictors of As, Cd, Co, Cu, Mo, Ni, Pb and Zn in solution. The total element concentration and the pH were the best predicting variables of the amount of element in solution for all trace elements analyzed, while organic carbon and Al or Mn oxides also influenced the solubility of some trace elements. Using the equations predicting elemental solubility, we wrote a model for natural attenuation in the computer program Stella that considers atmospheric deposition as the input for trace elements and leaching as the output. Simulations were carried out for the 40 soils during 1,000 years with steady deposition inputs. At current atmospheric deposition rates and the neutral to alkaline pH of these soils, attenuation occurred in most soils for Mo. For As, Cd, Co, Cu and Ni it occurred only in soils with abundant total element concentrations or an acidic pH. Minor retention occurred with Pb and Zn. Only Cd and Cu were of concern in leaching waters. The developed model can serve as a decision making tool in the selection of natural attenuation as a remediation strategy.</description><creator>Reyes Delgadillo, Dulce B.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Soils -- Trace element content.</subject><subject>Trace elements -- Environmental aspects.</subject><subject>Metals -- Environmental aspects.</subject><title>Modeling natural attenuation of trace elements in soils</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Dulce B.

These tropopause level, synoptic scale Rossby waves are of primary importance for weather development at the surface. In particular, extreme weather events have been linked to the existence of overlying upper level meridionally elongated filaments of stratospheric (high potential vorticity) air which form during the breaking of these waves. Motivated by the desire to understand the conditions under which these waves are formed and to improve their predictability, the current thesis discusses one excitation mechanism---the potential vorticity anomaly associated with a hurricane approaching the extra-tropics. Attention is directed toward the adiabatic interaction of the cyclone with the polar jet before the two features meet. The hurricane's ability to excite Rossby waves is verified from observations of past interactions and theoretical study using a mechanistic model with idealized settings. The nature of the interaction between the cyclone and the polar jet is found to be sensitive to parameters such as the cyclone's radius and PV anomaly. Three different regimes have been identified. It is also concluded that the same parameters have influence on the skill of the Rossby wave prediction. The more intense the cyclone is, the harder it is to accurately predict the response of the polar jet.</description><creator>Ravia, Roni.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Hurricanes.</subject><subject>Rossby waves.</subject><subject>Jet stream.</subject><title>Excitation and dispersion of a Rossby wave train on the polar jet by an extra-tropical transition of a hurricane</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Roni Ravia, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c534fs94v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36v276s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ww72bg921</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Many different methodologies have been developed for analyzing multithreaded programs. These analyses present a wide variety of approaches and tend to be rather complicated because they work on applications formed by several threads executed in a nondeterministic order. To address these issues this thesis introduces XThread, a flexible and modular framework for developing different concurrency analyses over multithreaded applications. The main objective of XTHREAD is to reduce the complexity of developing concurrency analyses by providing high level abstractions that close the breach between the language spoken by the researcher and the language the framework provides. Moreover, this framework provides different tools that are often required for solving issues common to many concurrency analyses. XTHREAD's modular organization also delivers a flexible environment for developing and testing different analysis implementations. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the framework a client analysis representing known but non-trivial multithreaded analysis is developed which is composed of several other concurrency analysis. A substantial number of benchmarks are used in order to test the implementations, showing that complex programs are accepted and correctly handled by the abstractions provided by the framework. Using the XTHREAD framework we demonstrate implementations that have both comparable accuracy and much better generality than is typically found in existing, research-level implementations of concurrency analyses.</description><creator>Ressia, Jorge Luis.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Simultaneous multithreading processors.</subject><subject>Computer multitasking.</subject><title>XTHREAD : a flexible concurrency analysis framework</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Jorge Luis Ressia, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nk322j96w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bg921</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:t722hf109</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Ecotones are gradients of change between expanses of similar species composition. These regions often mark co-occurring range limits for several species, and thus are ideal for elucidating ecological and biogeographical phenomena. The forest to tundra transition (FTT) is one of the world's most prominent ecotones, but remains poorly studied especially with regard to vertebrate species occurrence. Vertebrate diversity, ecological structure and resource selection were characterized across the Yukon FTT using diversity metrics, ordination, hierarchical clustering, and resource modeling. The FTT represents an abrupt drop in vertebrate species richness within the more gradual, continental scale diversity gradient. Despite the patchiness and complexity in vegetative structure over this ecotone, the terrestrial vertebrate community is divisible into boreal, taiga, and tundra compartments. Most species conform to resource associations reported closer to the core of their range, generating remarkably consistent habitat and species associations despite a complex patchwork of contrasting habitat types.</description><creator>Pretzlaw, Troy.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Taigas -- Yukon.</subject><subject>Ecotones -- Yukon.</subject><subject>Mammals -- Habitat -- Yukon.</subject><subject>Tundras -- Yukon.</subject><title>Pattern, composition and resource selection of terrestrial vertebrates across the Yukon forest to tundra transition</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Troy Pretzlaw, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5t34sp62s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t722hf109</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vh53x1230</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Maintaining a safe water supply is particularly crucial for karst islands such as Barbados. In order to take proper measures to prevent and reduce saltwater intrusion and to safely extract the right fraction of recharge, karst characteristics must first be fully understood. Geomorphologic investigations of karst surface features of the Porters &amp; Trents groundwater catchments (Barbados) employed GIS technologies to explore the development and distribution of sinkhole features. Contour-based digital elevation models, surface geology, lithology, and remote sensing images were incorporated in this investigation. Seventy-six sinkholes were investigated and occupied approximately 1% (0.16 km2) of the total area (16.41 km2) under study. It was found that age of karstification is not related to age of a terrace. The middle terrace was the one found to be most karstified. Yet, degree of karstification within a terrace is age related. Also, cluster density increases with age of coral within the middle terrace. Density of sinkholes within a cluster also increases with age of coral within the middle terrace. Finally, this study shows that sinkhole long axis, cluster elongation direction, sinkhole alignment and karst lineament all have a tendency to a northeast alignment. This supports the idea that underlying coral rock fracture and conduits have a northeast orientation.</description><creator>Huang, Hsin-Hui, 1976-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Geographic information systems -- Barbados.</subject><subject>Geomorphology -- Barbados.</subject><subject>Sinkholes -- Barbados.</subject><subject>Karst -- Barbados.</subject><title>Geomorphologic investigations on karst terrain : a GIS-assisted case study on the island of Barbados</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Hsin-Hui Huang, 2007</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cn69m8298.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vh53x1230</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Bioresource Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q237hw95n</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The manipulation of the molecular mechanisms that govern distraction osteogenesis (DO) in order to increase the biomechanical strength of new bone and to accelerate its synthesis has been the topic of intense research during the past decades. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play an important role in bone formation. In this study, using a rabbit model of DO, the expressions of BMP's major intracellular signalling molecules, Smad proteins, was analyzed and correlated with the expression of BMP ligands and receptors. Based on these results, which confirmed post-receptor activity for the BMP signalling pathway during DO, we hypothesized that exogenous BMPs injected early in the distraction phase will accelerate bone formation in cases of DO. The cellular changes induced by local application of rhBMP-7 (OP-1) on bone formation were therefore investigated, as well as the possible pathways through which OP-1 was responsible for these effects. The present study reveals that acceleration of bone formation can be attained after injection of OP-1 early during the distraction protocol. The enhanced bone formation, which occurs through the activation of numerous pathways, most likely depends on a non-vascular mechanism.</description><creator>Hrit, Manuela.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Acceleration of bone formation in distraction osteogenesis by bone morphogenetic protein-7</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Manuela Hrit, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b5644w882.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q237hw95n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Dentistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rx913v04g</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The importance of spatial variation in abundance for the assessment of climate change impacts was examined using the North American beaver ( Castor canadensis) in Quebec as a model species. A preliminary characterization of the beavers' range edge improved the core-sampling bias and revealed that beavers are present at low densities, in shrubby riparian habitats as far north as the communities of Tasiujaq and Umiujaq. Spatial variation in beaver abundance across the province follows a roughly logistic pattern, with abundance peaking in southern Quebec, declining steeply around 49°N, and remaining uniformly low as far as 58°N. Although climate sensitivity of beaver abundance and the greatest changes in future beaver density are predicted to occur near the middle of their range, beavers are expected to occupy most of the province by 2055. These results highlight the value of incorporating density estimates from across a species' range into climate envelope models.</description><creator>Jarema, Stacey Isabelle.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>American beaver -- Québec (Province) -- Geographical distribution.</subject><subject>American beaver -- Geographical distribution -- Climatic factors -- Québec (Province)</subject><title>The abundance and distribution of beavers (Castor canadensis) in Québec, Canada /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Stacey Isabelle Jarema, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5d86p464g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rx913v04g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0g354k536</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Nogo-66, a potent inhibitory domain of Nogo, signals through a tripartite Nogo receptor complex on neurons that leads to growth cone collapse and neurite outgrowth inhibition through cytoskeletal rearrangement. Here, we indicate that cofilin is one of the actin-binding proteins regulated by Nogo-66 under the influence of Rho GTPases. We observed a sequential change of cofilin phosphorylation from 0 to 60 minutes after Nogo-66 treatment. The increase and decrease of cofilin phosphorylation induced by Nogo-66 is regulated by LIMK1 and SSH1L, respectively. Both LIMK1 and SSH1L activity are regulated by Nogo-66 in a ROCK-dependent manner. 14-3-3 proteins are cytosolic scaffolding proteins that mediate Nogo-66 signals toward cofilin through interacting with SSH1L phosphatase.</description><creator>Hsieh, Sidney Hsein-Kang, 1978-</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Regulation of actin-depolymerizing factor cofilin in response to Nogo-66</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Sidney Hsein-Kang Hsieh, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d504rq569.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0g354k536</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9k41zj79b</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Diamonds have been discovered in a variety of potassic ultramafic rocks including group-I and group-II kimberlites, olivine lamproites and aillikites, all of which are macroscopically similar and can be difficult to differentiate when viewed under the microscope. However, group-I kimberlites, and to a much lesser extent group-II kimberlites and olivine lamproites, are known to contain economic concentrations of diamonds. This study addresses the problem of distinguishing among different types of kimberlitic and related rocks by developing a geochemically-based method for classifying them. Geochemical methods have been largely ignored in the classification of kimberlites and related rock types due to high concentrations of xenoliths. However, this problem can be largely overcome by only selecting matrix material for analysis. An evolving kimberlitic magma will become enriched or improvished in Si due to the fractionation of olivine and phlogopite, depending on the initial Si concentration of the magma. As they have low Si concentrations, group-I kimberlites and aillikites can be separated from group-II kimberlites and meimechites, which have higher Si concentrations for any Mg content. Furthermore, since aillikites and meimechites are relatively rich in Fe compared to group-I and group-II kimberlites, these rock types form four separate fields on a Si vs. Fe discrimination diagram. Similar rock-type separation is observed when the ratio of La to Yb is plotted against the ratio of Sm to Yb. Kimberlite and other potassic ultramafic rocks were sampled from nine areas in Quebec: the Otish Mountains, Wemindji, Torngat Mountains, Desmaraisville, Temiscamingue, Ile Bizard, Lac Leclair, Baie James and Ayer's Cliff regions. Major and selected trace element concentrations were determined by XRF analysis for all samples, while a subset of representative samples was selected for trace element analysis by ICP-MS. Electron microprobe analyses of unaltered olivine and phlogopite were also conducted. Of the 37 samples that were classified both mineralogically and chemically, 23 or 62% were correctly classified using Fe and Si. This number increases to 84%, if the REE are used in conjunction with Si and Fe. The Si vs. Fe discrimination diagram separates group-I kimberlite from most aillikite and meimechite rocks and group-II kimberlite/olivine lamproite rocks from most aillikite and meimechite rocks. Therefore, major and trace element geochemistry offers an important tool for the classification of kimberlitic rocks. Vasilenko et al. (2002) and Francis (2003) both suggested that diamond grades can be correlated with the major element compositions of the kimberlites. The data collected in this study confirm the inverse relationship between TiO2 concentration and diamond grade. The lowest TiO 2 values were obtained on samples from the Otish Mountains and Renard samples in particular. Other areas of Quebec are characterized by higher TiO2 contents with most samples containing greater than 2 wt% TiO 2. Therefore, the kimberlitic rocks from the Renard locality have the greatest potential for an economic diamond deposit. The origin of this correlation needs to be explored, however, because it is unclear whether this is a feature of the mantle source, or reflects the survivability of diamonds within the kimberlites.</description><creator>Hartzler, Joy R.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Geochemical prospecting -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Kimberlite -- Québec (Province).</subject><title>The geological exploration of kimberlitic rocks in Québec /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Joy R.

Exotic species also impact ecosystems in less conspicuous ways by provoking native species to alter their foraging behaviour. Subtle impacts such as diet shifts are frequent, and can have consequences for food web dynamics and the fitness of native predators. Diet shifts involving the consumption of exotic species require native predators to recognize, capture and handle novel prey. In this thesis, I document a diet shift in the St. Lawrence River involving a common native fish and Eurasian mussels that invaded the river in the early 1990s. I conducted diet analysis of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) at multiple sites in the upper St. Lawrence River and discovered that they consumed substantial quantities of zebra and quagga mussels (Dreissena spp.) in the Soulanges Canal, an artificial waterway west of Montreal. This was unexpected because perch lack adaptations for crushing molluscs. This foraging innovation was not observed at the same site in the early 1990s or at other sites at any time. Mussel shells were weaker at this site, probably because of exposure to calcium-poor water. This suggests that water chemistry mediates yellow perch predation on mussels. This study provides an example of diet shifts involving exotic prey and illustrates the influence of abiotic factors on species interactions.</description><creator>Harper, Kathryn M.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Zebra mussel -- Predators of -- Saint Lawrence River.</subject><subject>Yellow perch -- Food -- Saint Lawrence River.</subject><subject>Quagga mussel -- Predators of -- Saint Lawrence River.</subject><title>Yellow perch consumption of invasive mussels in the St. Lawrence River</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Kathryn M.

Results reveal that the environment explains the largest portion of variability in tree growth. Moreover, of the small amount of variation explained by diversity, species identity is found to be twice as important then species richness.

PLIC-1 is a Ubiquitin- like (UBL) protein that binds the ubiquitin- interacting motif (UIM) of the proteasomal subunit S5a, and has been proposed to act as a proteasomal shuttle. Here, we show the UBL of PLIC-1 also binds the UIM-containing EPS15, an endocytic protein, and they function together in the transport of aggregates to the perinuclear aggresome. We also show PLIC-1 changes localization upon expression of an endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) substrate, as well as binds an ERAD component, E4B. This indicates a role in shuttling ERAD substrates in particular to the proteasome for degradation. Taken together, this allows the proposal of a dual model for PLIC-1 function: under low aggregation, ubiquitinated proteins such as ERAD substrates are shuttled to the proteasome, but under high aggregation the proteasome is overwhelmed and PLIC-1, with EPS15, promotes aggresome formation.</description><creator>Heir, Renu.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>PLIC-1 plays a dual role in protein aggregate transport and proteasomal shuttling</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Renu Heir, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1z40kz089.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7p88cm82n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8s45qd975</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Understanding culturally related health values and identifying ethnically specific health seeking pathways can help health care providers supply culturally competent services and enhance cooperation with patients of different backgrounds. Cultural competency training, notably through cultural awareness courses, promotes understanding of the impact of social factors on illness and thus prepares medical and dental students to better serve their patients. Cultural awareness can also help preventive health programs fit community needs and cultural contexts. Despite the fact that Chinese immigrants are the fastest growing ethnic minority in North America, few studies have been published on their beliefs and health-seeking behaviours following immigration. We thus lack information on how Chinese immigrants regard dental health and manage their dental problems. Objective. The aims of this study were to explore how oral illness is viewed by Chinese immigrants in Montreal, Canada and how they manage dental problems. Methods. We conducted a qualitative research study based on semi-structured, one-on-one interviews and thematic analyses of the transcribed interviews. Twelve adult Montreal Chinese immigrants with a high level of education participated in the study. Results. Chinese immigrants in Montreal have a good understanding of dental caries in terms of its etiology, process, and ways to prevent and treat it. It thus seems that there is no major cultural barrier between this type of immigrant and oral health care professionals in regard to dental caries. However, we also observed that traditional beliefs and medications coexist with scientific dental knowledge and professional treatments concerning problems such as gingival swelling, gingival bleeding, and bad breath. In the case of gingival swelling, for instance, participants identified etiological factors that referred to both cultures: local factors referred to oral hygiene and were related to scientific culture, whereas general factors referred to traditional knowledge ("internal fire"). Chinese immigrants' dental health seeking pathways include self-treatment, consulting a dentist in Canada or in China during a return visit, and obtaining Chinese traditional medicine. The dental health seeking pathways varied depending on the circumstances. For dental caries and other acute diseases such as toothache, Chinese immigrants prefer to consult a dentist. For chronic diseases, some of them rely on self-treatment or an alter-native treatment such as traditional Chinese medicine. The language barrier, financial problems and lack of trust are the main factors affecting Chinese immigrants' access to dental care services in Canada. Former bad medical or dental experience among Chinese immigrants causes a loss of trust in Western medicine and dentistry and influences the decision to seek alternative treatments. Conclusion. This study suggests that, in order to facilitate dentist-patient communication; oral health professionals should be informed of immigrants' representation of oral health and illness, and that Chinese immigrants should be provided with basic scientific knowledge.</description><creator>Dong, Mei, 1966-</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Health Sciences, Dentistry.</subject><subject>Sociology, Ethnic and Racial Studies.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</subject><title>Oral health beliefs and dental health care-seeking behaviors among Chinese immigrants</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Mei Dong, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6969z5112.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8s45qd975</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Dentistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8p58pj16x</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:14:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The use of an ocean surface velocity dependent wind stress is examined in the context of a 3-layer double-gyre quasigeostrophic wind-driven ocean circulation model. The new wind stress formulation results in a large reduction of the power input by the wind into the oceanic circulation. This wind stress is proportional to a quadratic function of Ua--u o, where Ua is the wind at 10m above the ocean surface and uo is the ocean surface current. Because the winds are typically faster than the ocean currents, the impact of the ocean surface velocity on the wind stress itself is relatively small. However, the power input is found to be greatly reduced with the new formulation. This is shown by simple scaling argument and numerical simulations in a square basin. Our results suggest that the wind power input may be as much as 35% smaller than is typically assumed. The ocean current signature is clearly visible in the scatterometer-derived wind stress fields. We argue that because the actual ocean velocity differs from the modeled ocean velocities, care must be taken in directly applying scatterometer-derived wind stress products to the ocean circulation models. This is not to say that the scatterometer-derived wind stress is not useful. Clearly the great spatial and temporal coverage make these data sets invaluable. Our point is that it is better to separate the atmospheric and oceanic contribution to the stresses. Finally, the new wind stress decreases the sensitivity of the solution to the (poorly known) bottom friction coefficient. The dependence of the circulation strength on different values of bottom friction is examined under the standard and the new wind stress forcing for two topographic configurations. A flat bottom and a meridional ridge case are studied. In the flat bottom case, the new wind stress leads to a significant reduction of the sensitivity to the bottom friction parameter, implying that inertial runaway occurs for smaller values of bottom friction coefficient. The ridge case also gives similar results. In the case of the ridge and the new wind stress formulation, no real inertial runaway regime has been found over the range of parameters explored.</description><creator>Duhaut, Thomas H.

We hypothesized that: (1) the prevalence of vitamin D and K deficiencies would be high despite routine vitamin therapy, (2) bone health would be reduced and (3) vitamin K and D status would be associated with bone health. Our results showed poor bone mineral mass in these CF children despite mild disease and good nutritional status. Neither vitamin K nor D was a predictor of bone health but weight and height Z-scores, fat-free mass, physical activity and lung function were all consistent predictors. These results indicate that nutritional status as well as physical activity are key determinants of bone health in CF children and offer a unique opportunity in the prevention of CF-related bone disease. Further vitamin intervention research needs to be done in this population.</description><creator>Drury, Donna.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Osteoporosis in children.</subject><subject>Vitamin D.</subject><subject>Cystic fibrosis in children.</subject><subject>Vitamin K.</subject><title>Vitamin D and K status and bone health in pediatric cystic fibrosis patients</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Donna Drury, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wd376191p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9593v066d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:w9505477b</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:14:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The objective of this study was to understand the pattern of variation in group structure and feeding behaviour of wintering Common Goldeneyes ( Bucephala clangula) on the Saint-Lawrence River, by comparing two major habitats for this species in the province of Quebec, one in freshwater and one in saltwater.

At Montreal, goldeneyes spent more time feeding under water. Temporal variables had a major influence on group structure and on diving time.

The two halves of the thesis discuss problems in standard propositional planning (STRIPS) and in planning with numeric state variables respectively. In the context of STRIPS, the primary focus is on the widely used relaxed plan heuristic (h+). A variety of cases are shown in which h+ provides systematically bad estimates of goal distance. To address this breakdown, a planning system called RRT-Plan is presented. This system is inspired by the concept of Rapidly-exploring Random Trees, which was originally developed for use in mobile robot path planning. Experimental results show that RRT-Plan is comparable to leading planners in terms of number of problems solved and plan quality. We conclude that the effectiveness of RRT-Plan is based on its ability to search the space of artificial goal orderings. The second half of the work considers heuristic search planning in numeric domains. Two particularly significant obstacles are identified. The Curse of Affluence is due to the vast blowup in the search space caused by the addition of numeric variables. The Curse of Poverty relates to the difficulty of finding relevant lower bounds on resource consumption. Exploration of the Curse of Affluence leads to the new concepts of reduced search and enhanced states. In reduced search, certain simple operators are not used to expand states. Instead, enhanced states are constructed which represent all possible states which could be achieved by suitably inserting simple operators in the plan. Enhanced states are represented by a set of constant discrete variables, and a convex hull of numeric values. This representation can be queried and updated in a natural way. Experimental results show that there are domains for which reduced search gives order of magnitude performance improvements over Metric-FF, a leading heuristic search planner for numeric domains.</description><creator>Burfoot, Daniel.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Heuristic programming.</subject><title>Limitations of and extensions to heuristic search planning</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Daniel Burfoot, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5712mc11x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/47429f707</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xp68km38m</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:14:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In the past 20 years, boron has been identified as an essential trace element for animals and humans but also as an increasingly important industrial pollutant. We examined first whether boron influenced survival of the gastrointestinal nematode Heligmosomoides bakeri. Female Balb/c mice were fed deficient (0.1 mug B/g), marginal (2.0 mug B/g) or control (12.0 mug B/g) diets, and infected with third-stage larvae. Although liver boron concentrations did not differ among diet groups, dietary boron deficiency impaired survival of the parasite and modulated a broad range of cytokines and chemokines. On the other hand, infection history altered liver mineral concentrations. Second, we examined whether elevated boron concentrations would exert toxic effects on H. bakeri in vitro. Boron toxicity was evidenced by reduced motility, fecundity, infectivity and survival. Feeding stages and free-living stages were more sensitive than non-feeding stages and parasitic stages respectively in a dose-dependent manner.</description><creator>Bourgeois, Annie-Claude.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Heligmosomatidae.</subject><subject>Trace elements in animal nutrition.</subject><subject>Boron in animal nutrition.</subject><subject>Helminthiasis -- Nutritional aspects.</subject><subject>Mice -- Parasites.</subject><title>Dietary boron deficiency and elevated in vitro boron concentrations reduce survival of the murine gastrointestinal nematode, Heligmosomoides bakeri</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Annie-Claude Bourgeois, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dn39x546k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xp68km38m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Parasitology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4m90f045w</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:14:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Improving our ability to identify the top quark pair (tt̄) primary vertex (PV) on an event-by-event basis is essential for many analyses in the lepton-plus-jets channel performed by the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) Collaboration. We compare the algorithm currently used by CDF (A1) with another algorithm (A2) using Monte Carlo simulation at high instantaneous luminosities. We confirm that A1 is more efficient than A2 at selecting the tt̄ PV at all PV multiplicities, both with efficiencies larger than 99%. Event selection rejects events with a distance larger than 5 cm along the proton beam between the tt¯ PV and the charged lepton. We find flat distributions for the signal over background significance of this cut for all cut values larger than 1 cm, for all PV multiplicities and for both algorithms. We conclude that any cut value larger than 1 cm is acceptable for both algorithms under the Tevatron's expected instantaneous luminosity improvements.</description><creator>Buzatu, Adrian.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Physics, Elementary Particles and High Energy.</subject><title>High-luminosity primary vertex selection in top-quark studies using the Collider Detector at Fermilab</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Adrian Buzatu, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dr26z232g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4m90f045w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vx021k38m</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:14:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The monograph [Mak95] introduced a multi-sorted first-order logic with dependent sorts (FOLDS) likely to serve as a 'perfectly invariant' foundational language for general category theory.

This infection is a well-established ailment in tropical and subtropical countries and recently the drug ivermectin has been introduced for the LF control programs. Ivermectin (IVM) is an excellent microfilaricide, but is not markedly macrofilaricidal. However, it causes a long-lasting reduction in the production of new larvae by female worms, suggesting that adult stages are affected. However, the mechanism by which IVM produces such effect in the adult worm is not well understood. One major reason is our incomplete understanding about the biological effect of IVM on adult stages. The present study was carried out to examine the in vitro effects of IVM on B. malayi adult worms using Brugia-gerbil animal model. And also to have some leads in understanding the drug-uptake and location of probable targets in the worm body by using fluorescent labeled IVM and confocal microscopy. The antifilarial effects of IVM were examined using three parameters: mf release by female worms, and motility, and viability in both male and female worms. The results reported in this study demonstrate that although IVM did not kill the adult worm, but showed significant antifilarial effects on B. malayi adult stages when examined in an in vitro system. Confocal microscopy images of the worms incubated in bodipy FITC-IVM showed strong specific localization signal in the anterior cephalic region of both male and female worms. These observations suggest the early/initial interactions of the drug with its probable receptors that could be located specifically in the head region.</description><creator>Bhatnagar, Barkha.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Ivermectin.</subject><subject>Elephantiasis -- Chemotherapy.</subject><subject>Ivermectin -- therapeutic use.</subject><subject>Filarial worms -- Effect of drugs on.</subject><subject>Brugia malayi -- drug effects.</subject><subject>Elephantiasis, Filarial -- drug therapy.</subject><title>An examination of the effects of ivermectin on Brugia malayi adult worms /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Barkha Bhatnagar, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5712mc126.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n296x342b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Parasitology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2j62s902f</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:14:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The generation of bioactive proteins is key to the cell's homeostasis. Proprotein convertases (PCs) are the enzymes responsible for this spatio-temporal regulated processing of inactive protein precursors into their active form. Until recently, PCs had been implicated in tumorigenesis in vitro and in animal models but not in human colorectal cancer. Our group showed that the expression of PC1/3, PC2 and 7B2 are aberrant in colorectal liver carcinoma. In this study, we have shown that the expression of PC5 but not NARC-1 was aberrant in colorectal cancer and their metastases. NARC-1's expression was not altered in either primary colorectal cancer or their metastases. Nevertheless, we found that its expression was greater in the liver than in the colon. PCS was overexpression in the primary tumor but downregulated in the metastases. We do not know if this altered protein expression profile is a cause or a consequence of tumorigenesis. Nonetheless, this aberrant expression may result in an alteration of the secretory pathway and consequently of the cellular microenvironment and thus favour tumor growth and/or metastasis.</description><creator>Bénay, Cassandre E.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><title>Abnormal expression of proprotein convertases PC56 but not NARC-1 in human colorectal cancer and their liver metastases</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Cassandre E.

In this regime, large oscillator motion modulates tunnelling in the SSET, which in turn affects the oscillator. This interplay leads to interesting strong feedback effects, including a highly non-thermal stationary oscillator state and a significant enhancement of the low-frequency current noise in the SSET. These effects and others are reminiscent of laser physics: the SSET corresponds to population-inverted atoms while the oscillator corresponds to cavity electro-magnetic field modes. We discuss the extent of this analogy and investigate the linewidth of the oscillator's noise spectrum. Our results are relevant to current experiments, and we point out several feasible measurements that could be done to observe strong feedback effects.</description><creator>Bennett, Steven, 1980-</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Physics, Condensed Matter.</subject><title>Strong feedback effects in nanoelectromechanical systems</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Steven Bennett, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/08612s89t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1z40kz10b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2514nq56j</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:14:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The objective of this thesis is to present the fabrication of a multiphoton microscope and the underlying theory responsible for its proper functioning. A basic introduction to nonlinear optics will give the necessary knowledge to the reader to understand the optical effects involved. Femtosecond laser pulses will be presented and characterized. Each part of the microscope, their integration and the design of the microscope will be discussed. The basic concepts of laser scanning microscopy are also required to explain the design of the scanning optics. Fast scanning problems and their solutions are also briefly viewed. As a working proof, the first images taken with the microscope will be presented. Fluorescent beads, rat tail tendon, gold nanoparticles and pollen grain images using various nonlinear effects will be shown and discussed.</description><creator>Bélisle, Jonathan.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Scanning electron microscopy.</subject><subject>Fluorescence microscopy.</subject><subject>Three-dimensional imaging.</subject><subject>Scanning electron microscopes -- Design and construction.</subject><title>Design and assembly of a multimodal nonlinear laser scanning microscope</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Jonathan Bélisle, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pk02cf93q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2514nq56j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:76537534n</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:14:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>L'effet de la vitamine E (VE) et l'arginine (ARG) sur les systèmes hummoraireet cellulaire de l'immunité a était évalué chez la volaille dans deux recherches. Lesystème hummoraire de l'immunité a était évalué en utilisant les paramètres tels que laproduction d'anticorps après une injection des globules rouge provenant des moutons(SRBC) et le niveau d'anticorps maternelle après une infection avec les virus causantla maladie 'infectious bursal disease' (lBDV), tandis que les effets sur le systemcellulaire de l'immunité avaient aussi été évalués en utilisant les paramètres comme'cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity test to phytogemagglutinin (PHA)' et endéterminant la concentration des lymphocytes T. Deux concentrations de ARG avaientété utilisées: normale (NARG, 1.2 % de la diète) et une concentration élevée (HARG,additionel 0.3 % dans l'eau ou 1 % dans les diètes); et 3 concentrations de VE: 40, 80et 400 lU/kg dans les diètes dans la première recherche et 40, 80, et 200 lU/kg dans ladeuxième recherche.</description><description>The effects of vitamin E (VE) and Arginine (ARG) on humoral and cellular immunity in chickens were investigated in two experiments. The humoral immunity was measured by antibody responses to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) and maternal antibody titers to the infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), while the cellular immunity was studied using the cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity test to phytogemagglutinin (PHA) and by counting subpopulations of T-lymphocytes. We used two levels of ARG: normal (NARG, 1.2% in feed) and high ARG (HARG, additional 0.3% in drinking water or 1% in feed in experiments 1 and 2, respectively); and three levels of VE were given: 40, 80, and 400 IU/kg feed in experiment 1, and 40, 80, and 200 in experiment 2. HARG improved the antibody response to SRBC compared with NARG ( P&lt;0.01 for experiment 1 and P&lt;0.013 for experiment 2) 4 days after injection in both experiments. In experiment 1, the VE80 birds maintained higher antibody titers to SRBC (P&lt;0.001) than the VE40 and VE400 birds 4, 8 and 16 d after inoculation. In experiment 2, the antibody titers to SRBC were higher in the VE80 birds compared with the VE200 birds at days 5, 8, and 12 after inoculation (P&lt;0.001). Maternal antibody titers (log10) to the IBDV were higher in the HARG than in the NARG diet in 17-day-old birds (P&lt;0.001) and higher in the VE80 than in the VE40 birds (P&lt;0.001), yet similar to those of the VE200 birds. No interactions were found between ARG and VE. Naive birds fed HARG exhibited a higher response than NARG birds (P&lt;0.05) to PHA-P at d 17 and to PHA-M at d 41, but, after a second exposure, high ARG levels did not have an effect. Also, in naive birds, the effects of VE were not significant at d 17, but showed an influence after a second exposure in 41-d-old birds. The percentage of T-helper (Th) and T-cytotoxic (Tc) cells in the blood of 29-d-old birds were not different between ARG levels (P=0.07 and P=0.06, respectively), but Th cells were higher in the VE80 and VE200 birds than in the VE40 birds, and Tc was higher in the VE80 than in the VE40 birds (P=0.02). The B-cell:T-cell ratio was higher in the HARG than the NARG birds (P=0.01) and in the VE40 compared with the VE80 and VE200 birds (P&lt;0.001). Neither ARG nor VE had an effect on the ratio of Th:Tc cells, nor on the percentage of immature T-lymphocytes. A combination of high levels of ARG and high levels of VE (80 IU/kg of BW) has an important immunomodulation effect on the cellular and humoral immune responses in broiler chickens, improving both maternal antibody titers against the IBDV and antibody titers against SRBC. A combination of ARG and VE increases the proportions of Th and Tc cells, the B-cell:T-cell ratio, and growth performance. The evidence suggests that ARG and VE play complementary and regulatory role on immune response and may enhance the resistance of broilers to infectious diseases. Key words.
