In this thesis, we focus on value-based learning methods, which  rely on computing utility values for different behavior strategies. Value-based  reinforcement learning methods have a solid theoretical foundation and a growing  history of successful applications to real-world problems. However, most existing  theoretically-sound algorithms work for small problems only. For complex real-world  decision tasks, approximate methods have to be used; in this case there is a  significant gap between the existing theoretical results and the methodologies  applied in practice. This thesis is devoted to the analysis of various factors that  contribute to the difficulty of learning with popular reinforcement learning  algorithms, as well as to developing new methods that facilitate the practical  application of reinforcement learning techniques. In the first part of this thesis, we investigate properties of  reinforcement learning tasks that influence the performance of value-based  algorithms. We present five domain-independent quantitative attributes that can be  used to measure various task characteristics. We study the effect of these  characteristics on learning and how they can be used for improving the efficiency of  existing algorithms. In particular, we develop one application that uses  measurements of the proposed attributes for improving exploration (the process by  which the agent gathers experience for learning good behavior  strategies). In large realistic domains, function approximation methods have  to be incorporated into reinforcement learning algorithms. The second part of this  thesis is devoted to the use of a function approximation model based on Sparse  Distributed Memories (SDMs) in approximate value-based methods. Like for all other  function approximators, the success of using SDMs in reinforcement learning depends,  to a large extent, on a good choice of the structure of the approximator. We propose  a new technique for automatically selecting certain structural parameters of the SDM  model on-line based on training data. Our algorithm takes into account the  interaction of function approximation with reinforcement learning algorithms and  avoids some of the difficulties faced by other methods from the existing literature.  In our experiments, this method provides very good performance and is  computationally efficient.</description><creator>Ratitch, Bohdana</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>On characteristics of Markov decision processes and reinforcement learning in large domains</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z029p516s.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wm117p37c</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cj82k7751</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:28:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Important gender differences exist regarding affective  disorders, and depression affects women two times more than men. Accumulating  evidence suggests a functional interrelationship between ovarian steroids, the  serotonergic (5-HT) system and depression. The objective of this thesis was thus to  study the modulation of the 5-HT neuronal firing activity by neuroactive steroids  and compare it between genders. It was achieved by means of in vivo extracellular  unitary recordings of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) 5-HT neurons in anesthetized  rats. The basal firing rate of DRN 5-HT neurons was significantly  higher in males (M) and pregnant females (P17) as compared to freely cycling females  (F). During pregnancy, 5-HT1A autoreceptors were partially desensitized, which is  consistent with the higher 5-HT neuronal firing activity. The GABAergic tonic  inhibition of 5-HT neurons was lower in both M and P17 as compared to F, which is  also in agreement with their greater 5-HT neuronal firing rate. In F, 5beta-pregnane-3,20-dione (5beta-DHP),  5alpha-pregnane-3alpha-ol,20-one (3alpha,5alpha-THP), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA),  its sulfated form DHEAS, testosterone (T), 17beta-estradiol (17beta-E) and  ganaxolone (a synthetic analog to 3alpha,5alpha-THP) significantly increased the  firing activity of 5-HT neurons. Of those, only DHEAS, T and 17beta-E were also  effective in M. The effect of 3alpha,5alpha-THP and ganaxolone in F, as well as of  DHEAS in both M and F, could be seen as early as after a 3-day treatment.  Furthermore, 3alpha,5alpha-THP and ganaxolone prevented the initial decrease in  firing activity caused by citalopram (a selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor), which is  responsible for its delay of therapeutic action. However, DHEAS could prevent it  only partially in both genders. These results constitute strong evidence of gender differences  in both the basal firing activity of 5-HT neurons and in their modulation by  neuroactive steroids. They also present some mechanisms of action by which gender  and hormonal fluctuations influence the 5-HT neuronal function. Finally, the results  of this thesis offer a cellular basis for the putative antidepressant effects of  neurosteroids, which may prove important particularly for affective disorders in  women.</description><creator>Robichaud, Malika</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Modulation of dorsal raphe nucleus serotonergic neurons by neuroactive steroids in relation to mood disorders</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20ss997.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cj82k7751</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x346d473s</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:28:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A double-pipe helical heat exchanger was studied numerically and  experimentally for both heat transfer and hydrodynamic  characteristics. Results from the numerical trials show that the inner Nusselt  numbers in the heat exchanger were similar to literature data, despite the different  boundary conditions. Nusselt numbers in the annulus were correlated to a modified  Dean number. It was shown that the thermal resistance in the annulus to be the  greatest limiting factor for the heat transfer, and heat transfer rates could be  increased by increasing the inner tube diameter. The Prandtl number was shown to affect the inner Nusselt number;  however the effects were much greater at low Dean numbers. These differences were  attributed to the difference in the developing thermal and hydrodynamic boundary  layers. The studies with the thermally dependent thermal conductivities showed that  the Nusselt number correlated well with a modified Graetz number. Thermally dependent viscosity had little effect on the heat  transfer; however it affected the pressure drop. Furthermore, it was shown that by  keeping the flow rate in the inner tube or the annulus constant, the pressure drop  in that section can be affected by changes in the flow rate in the opposite section,  due to the change in the heat transfer rate and hence the average temperature and  viscosity of the fluid. Non-Newtonian fluids showed little effect on the heat  transfer rates, though they significantly affected the pressure drop  relations. The uniformity of the residence time and the temperature  distribution were both increased in the inner tube with increasing flow rates. It  was shown that a smaller gap size in the annulus resulted in more uniform residence  times. Temperature distributions in the inner tube and the annulus were affected by  changes in the flow velocity in the opposite section, with lower flow rates  resulting in more uniform temperature distributions. Implications of using parallel  flow versus counterflow, heating versus cooling, and flow rate are  discussed. Overall heat transfer coefficients and Nusselt numbers were  calculated for the experimental data. The inner and annulus heat transfer  coefficients were determined using Wilson plots. The results were compared to the  numerical data and literature values and showed reasonable agreement.

Even though  unions have rarely supported women's rights historically, and are currently losing  political power in the neoliberal economic context, I argue that union women have a  crucial role to play in the social struggle to expand women's labor rights. Building  on theories about the social construction of citizenship, I develop an original  theoretical framework suggesting that civil society acts on three levels to expand  citizenship rights: the individual level (working with individuals to make them more  rights-conscious), within social institutions (working to ensure that policies  within social institutions actually reflect the rights of individuals), and at the  level of the state, where civil society contributes to the construction of new  citizenship discourses. The framework is then applied to the Mexican case. Examining the  rise of working class feminism in the context of the debt crisis and transition to  economic liberalism in the 1980s, and the subsequent democratic transition in 2000,  I show how these contexts led union women to participate in civil associations  active at each of these three levels of citizenship construction. More specifically,  this participation has been important in raising awareness of women's labor rights  among women workers, challenging patriarchal union structures, and bringing the  issue of women's labor rights into the debate over reform of Mexico's Federal Labor  Law. I ultimately conclude that in the absence of support from a broad women's labor  movement, the chances that women's labor rights will be supported by the Mexican  government and Mexican unions will be low.</description><creator>Brickner, Rachel, 1974-</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Women -- Mexico -- Social conditions.</subject><subject>Women's rights -- Mexico.</subject><subject>Labor movement -- Mexico</subject><subject>Employee rights -- Mexico.</subject><subject>Women employees -- Mexico.</subject><title>Union women and the social construction of citizenship in Mexico</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ns064656v.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4t64gn64v</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:f4752h202</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:28:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The aim of this work was to investigate the role of CD4 + T  cells, central to airway inflammation in asthma, in airway remodeling. Structural  changes that occur in asthmatic airways in association with inflammation include an  increase in airway smooth muscle mass, which participates in causing airway  hyperresponsiveness. We aimed to gain further insights into the mechanisms that may  link inflammation with remodeling using a rat model of experimental asthma. We  hypothesized that CD4+ T cells drive airway smooth muscle remodeling. Adoptive  transfer of CD4+ T cells from ovalbumin-sensitized rats induced increased  proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis of airway myocytes in naive recipients  upon repeated antigen challenge, which resulted in an increase in airway smooth  muscle mass. CD4+ T cells genetically modified to express green fluorescent protein  were localized by confocal microscopy in juxtaposition to airway smooth muscle  cells, suggesting that CD4 + T cells may modulate smooth muscle cell function  through direct cell-cell interaction in vivo. We subsequently co-cultured  antigen-stimulated CD4+ T cells with cell cycle-arrested airway smooth muscle cells  and demonstrated by flow cytometry that CD4+ T cells induce myocyte proliferation,  dependent on T cell activation and direct T cell/myocyte contact. Reciprocally,  direct cell contact prevented activation-induced T cell apoptosis as well as  spontaneous apoptosis of resting T cells, suggesting T cell/myocyte cross-talk. Our  data demonstrate that CD4+ T cells drive airway smooth muscle remodeling in  experimental asthma, and suggest that a mechanism involving a direct  "synapse" participates in CD4+ T cell regulation of myocyte turnover and  induction of remodeling. The goal of genetically modifying CD4+ T cells involved  technical challenges relevant to the field of gene therapy and are dealt with in  detail in this thesis.

The testing  of this novel hypothesis required first and foremost that a reliable measure of  cultural identity generally, and the clarity of a person's cultural identity in  particular, be developed. To meet this goal Study 1 introduced an innovative method  in a story-telling form, the "Cultural Narrative". The Cultural Narrative  method is built on McAdams' (1996, 2001) Life Story Model for assessing personal  identity. In order to verify its generalizability, this novel methodology was  applied to two natural cultural groups: Francophone and Anglophone Quebecers.  Results showed that for Francophones, a clear cultural narrative was associated with  positive personal self-esteem and personal well-being, in support of the hypothesis.  Unexpectedly, however, results showed that for Anglophones, a clear cultural  narrative was associated with negative collective self-esteem, in complete  opposition to the hypothesis. In order to theoretically refine the nature of the  relationship between cultural identity clarity and individuals' esteem and  well-being, Study 2 explored the historical changes in the relative ingroup status  of Francophone and Anglophone Quebecers. Results indicate that when temporal  relative deprivation patterns are such that the status of one's ingroup is perceived  to be on the rise, cultural identity clarity is associated with positive personal  well-being. In contrast, when one's ingroup trajectory is perceived to be on the  downturn, cultural identity clarity is associated with a lack of personal  well-being.</description><creator>Bougie, Evelyne</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Group identity -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Self-esteem -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Québec (Province) -- Social life and customs</subject><title>The cultural narrative of francophone and anglophone Quebecers and their perceptions of temporal relative deprivation : links with esteem and well-being</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h702q6802.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sj139244f</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zs25x9085</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:28:08Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Proteins are known to be post-translationally modified. This  thesis will discuss arginine methylation, one of the many post-translational  modifications that occur within the cell. The enzymes that catalyze this  post-translational modification are called arginine methyltransferases. The three  main types of methylated arginines include monomethylated arginine (MMA), asymmetric  dimethylated arginine (aDMA) and symmetric dimethylated arginines (sDMA). Type I  arginine methyltransferases catalyze the formation of MMA and aDMA; Type II enzyme  catalyze the formation of MMA and sDMA. Protein arginine methylation has been  implicated in the regulation of many different cellular processes, including  transcription, cellular localization, protein-protein interaction and signal  transduction. The purpose of this work was to further characterize arginine  methylation by identifying new members of the arginine methyltransferase enzyme  family in Drosophila melanogaster and to study the effects of protein arginine  methylation on novel substrates. I identified and characterized nine homologues of  arginine methyltransferases in Drosophila that were named DART1 to DART9, for  drosophila arginine methyltransferases 1-9. All nine enzymes are expressed at  various developmental stages. I discovered that a substrate of mammalian enzyme  protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) can also be methylated by PRMT5. I also  identified HIV-1 Tat protein as the first substrate of the novel enzyme  PRMT6.</description><creator>Boulanger, Marie-Chloé</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><title>Arginine methylation, the characterization of a post-translational modification</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1831ck47b.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zs25x9085</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pg15bf392</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:28:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Let R(t) be the error term in Weyl's law for (2 n +  1)-dimensional Heisenberg manifolds.

The research subject reported in this thesis is on  theoretical investigations of thermal energy transport in systems whose linear  dimension is less than the wavelength of thermal phonons. Such situations occur in  mesoscopic and nanoscopic scale dielectric structures which can now be fabricated in  a number of laboratories. Due to the small system dimensions, phonons must be  treated as waves. Thermal energy transport, therefore, must be treated as phonon  wave propagation through the system. After reviewing the general physics of thermal energy transport  in the classical regime, we derive, for dielectric materials, a formula for thermal  energy flux in devices involving multi-terminals each connected to a thermal  reservoir at local equilibrium. The energy flux is driven by a temperature bias and  traverses the system by virtue of phonon wave scattering. A multi-terminal thermal  conductance formula is derived in terms of phonon transmission coefficient. Using  our theoretical formulation, we investigate thermal transport properties of both  two-terminal and four-terminal dielectric devices by solving the quantum scattering  problem using a mode matching numerical technique. For thermal transport in a T-shaped dielectric nanostructure  with two-terminals at low temperature, due to quantum interference the transmission  coefficient of phonons becomes quite complicated. We found that the value of phonon  transmission coefficients at zero energy may be unity or zero depending on a  geometrical ratio of the nanostructure. The transmission has an oscillation behavior  with quasi-periodicity and irregularity. The thermal conductance is found to  increase monotonically with temperature---a result that we conclude to be generally  true for any two-terminal device. We confirm the existence of the universal quantum  of thermal conductance which exists at the low temperature limit, and such a quantum  is robust against all the system parameters. The physical behavior of four-terminal thermal conductance for  mesoscopic dielectric systems with arbitrary shapes of scattering region is also  investigated in detail. If we make a two-terminal measurement in the four-terminal  device, the two-terminal conductance is a monotonically increasing function of  temperature, and is equal to the universal quantum of thermal conductance masked by  a geometric factor. If we make a four-terminal measurement, the four-terminal  conductance has a non-monotonic dependence. In the low temperature limit, we predict  that the four-terminal conductance diverges inversely proportional to  temperature. Finally, we discuss an interesting theoretical problem on the  general behavior of thermal conductance for multi-terminal systems when thermal  carriers satisfy fractional exclusion statistics. Our analysis allows us to conclude  that results for fractional exclusion statistics are quite different from those of  the Bose-Einstein statistics.</description><creator>Yang, Ping, 1961-</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Physics, Condensed Matter.</subject><title>Thermal transport in mesoscopic dielectric systems</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1n79h487k.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tm70mv64m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k3569506c</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:28:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Although heritability estimates of schizophrenia are high,  studies attempting to identify specific genes for schizophrenia have been only  modestly successful. Strategies to improve the power of genetic studies include the  creation of homogeneous subtypes of schizophrenia based on symptom presentation, and  the identification of behavioural abnormalities that reflect the presence of genes  for schizophrenia ("behavioural markers of risk") even in the absence of  the full clinical disorder. Oculomotor abnormalities are one of the most  well-documented markers of risk. It is not known whether abnormalities in motor  control are specific to the oculomotor system or whether they are found as well in  other domains such as skeletomotor control. It is also not known whether different  types of schizophrenia-related symptoms, which presumably have distinct neural  bases, are associated with different behavioural abnormalities. This thesis investigates oculomotor and skeletomotor function in  clinically unaffected individuals who are at elevated risk for schizophrenia based  on their scores on either a positive-symptom schizotypy questionnaire (Perceptual  Aberration Scale) (n = 21) or a negative-symptom schizotypy questionnaire (Physical  Anhedonia) (n = 20), and in Controls (n = 29). In Manuscript 1, we review the evidence suggesting that  skeletomotor deficits are present in neuroleptic-naive schizophrenia patients and  high-risk populations. The review supports the notion of skeletomotor dysfunction in  these groups and underscores the lack of studies using instrumentation to  characterize the deficits. In Manuscript 2, we compare the oculomotor performance of  positive-symptom and negative-symptom schizotypes to that of controls. Results  suggest that smooth pursuit deficits identify high-risk individuals with either  positive or negative symptomatology, while antisaccade deficits identify primarily  individuals with positive symptoms. In Manuscript 3, we use high-speed  instrumentation and kinematic measures to evaluate skeletomotor function, and to  assess the relationship between oculomotor and skeletomotor deficits in positive and  negative-symptom schizotypes. This study revealed differential patterns of  skeletomotor deficits in positive- and negative-symptom schizotypy, with both  patterns suggestive of frontal-striatal dysfunction. In general, oculomotor and  skeletomotor deficits were not associated. Together these results support the notion of motor deficits  across domains in risk for schizophrenia. In addition, they highlight the importance  of distinguishing between positive and negative symptomatology when investigating  the pathophysiology of risk for schizophrenia.</description><creator>Wolff, Anne-Lise</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Movement disorders.</subject><subject>Schizophrenia -- Genetic aspects.</subject><subject>Eye -- Movement disorders.</subject><title>A kinematic investigation of oculomotor and skeletomotor performance in schizotypy /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5x21tf91n.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k3569506c</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1544bp70w</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:28:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The continuing importance of literacy and the emergence of  electronic text forms have incited interest in the use of technology in a number of  domains, among them writing and multimedia authoring. The expectation is that  technology will facilitate the writing process by supporting cognitive processes and  align school instruction with real-world tasks by providing more meaningful learning  environments. This study tracked middle school students' task representation as they  participated in protracted multimedia design and writing tasks. Students were  engaged in the creation of a literary magazine over several weeks, with both written  and media products linked to a particular theme. Cognitive strategies and behaviours  associated with problem solving and communication are described through joint design  activities. Students' working activities and their competencies in English Language  Arts and Computer Science were identified, and cognitive processes tracked in  negotiating and defining the boundaries of the task. Teachers' task representations  were also examined in terms of their ability to address student variability;  strengths and weaknesses between members of a group as well as their inherent  dynamics are brought to the fore. Results point to the need for a better  understanding of complex cognitive activities in developing new and more  sophisticated repertoires of practice to realize the vision of children  'constructing' their own knowledge. Consequently, educators will gain new insights  into what students can achieve when given the opportunities and the tools to do so.  The role of educators is seen as instrumental in providing structure and mechanisms  for supporting students' engagement in complex tasks. Findings underscore the  importance of adopting a broader framework for thinking about the impact of  students' participation in literacy projects.

My negative experiences led to a quest for insight  and solutions through volunteer, professional and academic pursuits. It culminated  in this exploration of caregivers' experiences and their decision-making to expose  the educational support they need. Caregivers tend to be family members, and  overwhelmingly women. Studies from various disciplines confirm that caregivers need  educational support to make decisions. Yet, little is known about what type of  educational support they need and how it is to be provided. Caregivers' voices are  seldom included in research and they are frequently blamed for the problems they  confront. This qualitative study honours caregivers' voices. Through in-depth  semi-structured interviews, the perspectives of five women form my primary source of  data. Personal documentation, archival materials, and interviews with experts in the  field supplement these data. To analyze the data two complementary analytic  approaches are used: categorization and contextualization. A categorization approach  organizes the data into conceptual themes. These themes include activities of  multitasking, being locked into a state of heightened alert, interpreting the  disease, and managing care. These activities reveal physical and psychological  suffering. Contextualization approaches situate the dilemmas the women face in  particular contexts. These dilemmas highlight their lack of authority. The analyses  indicate that the women engage in a wide range of decision-making and that they need  both similar and specific types of educational support. These types of support  include (1) lessening their burdens and their frustrations of decision-making; (2)  facilitating ethical decision-making; (3) providing information about medical  treatments; and (4) assisting with the access to and with the assessment of suitable  resources.

This study departs from  typical military-centric civil-military relations literature by employing a  civilian-centric analysis. In particular, it shows how the former's focus on  changing levels of internal threat cannot account for variations in the levels of  civilian control over the military. The study instead adopts a framework that  focuses on the incentive structure of civilian leaders as determined by competitive  elections; the political capacity of leaders as reflected in their parliamentary  majority, political experience and the effectiveness of their economic policies; and  institutional rules, such as the system of government and organization of the  parties. The thesis argues that, depending on their incentive structure and  political capacity, the civilian leaders will either challenge a politically  powerful military or ally with that military by adopting its preference structures.  The relevance of this model for understanding civil-military relations in the  aftermath of a transition to democracy is explored in the Turkish case by examining  the shift from low to high levels of military influence between late 1980s and  mid-1990s. The thesis identifies this shift by looking at the incentive structure  and the political capacity of two civilian leaders: Prime Minister/President Turgut  Ozal and Prime Minister Tansu Ciller.</description><creator>Aknur, Müge</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Özal, Turgut</subject><subject>Çiller, Tansu</subject><subject>Turkey -- Politics and government -- 1980-</subject><subject>Civil-military relations -- Turkey</subject><title>Civil-military relations in Turkey : analysis of civilian leaders</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dr26xx76j.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36tz026</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p5547r812</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:28:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis contains new results on the subject of polygonal  structure reconfiguration. Specifically, the types of structures considered here are  polygons, polygonal chains, triangulations, and polyhedral surfaces. A sequence of  vertices (points), successively joined by straight edges, is a polygonal chain. If  the sequence is cyclic, then the object is a polygon. A planar triangulation is a  set of vertices with a, maximal number of non-crossing straight edges joining them.  A polyhedral surface is a three-dimensional structure consisting of flat polygonal  faces that are joined by common edges. For each of these structures there exist several methods of  reconfiguration. Any such method must provide a well-defined way of transforming one  instance of a structure to any other. Several types of reconfigurations are reviewed  in the introduction, which is followed by new results. We begin with efficient  algorithms for comparing monotone chains. Next, we prove that flat chains with  unit-length edges and angles within a wide range always admit reconfigurations,  under the dihedral model of motion. In this model, angles and edge lengths are  preserved. For the universal model, where only edge lengths are preserved, several  types of hexagons that cannot be reconfigured are exhibited. New bounds are provided  for the number of operations required to reconfigure between triangulations, using  "point moves" and "edge flips". Finally, unfolding motions are  proven to always be possible for specific slices of polyhedra.</description><creator>Aloupis, Greg</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Reconfigurations of polygonal structures</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9c67wn34w.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p5547r812</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:r207tp85f</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:28:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Allyl propargyl ethers undergo cobalt-mediated  cycloisomerization reactions to form dihydrofurans in good yield and with excellent  diastereoselectivity. The reaction is proposed to proceed by way of an allylic C-H  activation and a formal 5-endo-dig cyclization. The reaction works with a range of  allylpropargyl ether substrates. 1,6-Enynes and allyl propargyl ethers undergo a cobalt-catalyzed  formal 5-endo-dig cyclization to form vinyl cyclopentenes and dihydrofurans,  respectively. The use of equimolar amounts of dicobalt octacarbonyl and trimethyl  phosphite affords optimum yields and improved selectivity for cycloisomerization vs.  alkene isomerization. The utility of the cycloisomerization reaction is exemplified  through the synthesis of the bis-tetrahydrofuran core of the annonaceous  acetogenins. A key feature of the approach centers on the cycloisomerization  reaction for the installation of two of the four stereocenters found in the  THF-subunit. An approach towards the total synthesis of Stolonoxide C is  described. The mono-THF subunit is synthesized from the corresponding cobalt  catalyzed cycloisomerization of an appropriate allylpropargyl ether.</description><creator>Ajamian, Alain</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Chemistry, Organic.</subject><title>Diastereoselective cobalt mediated and catalyzed cycloisomerization of allylpropargyl ethers and 1,6- enynes : application towards the total syntheses of the annonaceous acetogenins and stolonoxide C</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9p290995j.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r207tp85f</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:v692t6855</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:28:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The dissertation offers a critical analysis of the Epitome de  Caesaribus, a fourth-century Latin series on the lives of the emperors from Augustus  to Theodosius (c. AD 395), and consists of seven chapters defining the text, the  genre, its sources, its religious milieu, and its political and social ideas. The  political ideas in the Epitome were deeply marked by the influence of the ascetic  ideal honouring moderation in drink, food, sleep, sex, and emotions such as anger.  Within the fourth-century Roman Empire, the epitomator offers moderate pagan views  which show interest about dreams, asceticism, and the providential nature of the  divinity. The dissertation proposes to see the Epitome as a literary artefact which,  through comparison with contemporary authors, allows one to extract from a bland  text ideas found among fourth-century elites in the emperor Honorius' Italy  (395-423).</description><creator>Gauville, Jean-Luc</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Emperors -- Rome</subject><subject>Rome -- Historiography</subject><title>Abbreviated histories : the case of the Epitome de Caesaribus (AD c. 395)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vd66w039t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v692t6855</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mk61rh47b</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:28:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A new methodology is proposed to solve the runner balancing  problem.

This fundamental issue in high-level vision is addressed by the use of  a novel molecular mapping technique that was developed for this  purpose. In the first study, the temporal dynamics of c-fos and zif268  expression were delineated in detail in the rat visual cortex. Knowing the precise  temporal parameters of up-regulation (after onset of sensory stimulation) and  down-regulation (after offset of sensory stimulation) of these genes was integral to  optimising the temporal aspects of the stimuli to be used for subsequent mapping  experiments. This study provided the critical information for devising stimuli with  corresponding temporal parameters to those of c-fos or zif268 so that one could take  advantage of the disparity between the expression of their mRNA and protein products  in order to visualise activated neurones. In the second study, the newly developed molecular mapping  technique was validated in the rat auditory, visual and multisensory systems. First,  bimodal audiovisual stimuli were designed using the data obtained from the first  study. Then, through the combined histological detection of the mRNA and protein  products of zif268, discrete populations of neurones responsive to either component  of the bimodal stimulus were visualised. It was also observed that a third  population of neurones was found that responded to the stimulation through both  sensory modalities. The combined results from these two studies set the stage for  addressing the issue of the organisation of face- and object-selective neurones of  the inferior temporal cortex in the vervet monkey brain. In the third study, the functional organisation of face- and  object-selective neurones was examined using the molecular mapping technique. Based  on the data gathered from the first two studies, suitable stimuli containing two  distinct object classes (conspecific faces and non-face familiar objects) were  designed with appropriate temporal parameters. Finally, the last study provided an opportunity to address the  issue of hemispheric asymmetry of function in the context of face processing in the  non-human primate brain. Results support the notion that there may indeed be  phylogenetic explanations for the hemispheric asymmetry observed in the human brain.</description><creator>Zangenehpour, Shahin</creator><contributor>Chaudhuri, Avijit (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Form perception -- Physiological aspects.</subject><subject>Brain mapping.</subject><subject>Face perception -- Physiological aspects.</subject><subject>Molecular neurobiology.</subject><subject>Cercopithecus aethiops -- Physiology.</subject><subject>Visual cortex -- Physiology.</subject><title>Bilateral distribution of face- and object-selective neurones in the adult vervet monkey inferotemporal cortex : a molecular mapping study</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/th83kz84v.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4b29b654j</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bz60cw782</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:28:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Studies have revealed that upon recognition by cytotoxic T  lymphocytes (CTL), apoptosis of the target cells is initiated by at least two  distinct mechanisms; the Fas-Fas ligand (Fas-L) pathway, in which surface Fas-L on  CTL cross-links Fas on target cells, and the granule exocytosis pathway whose major  components consist of perforin, a putative pore-forming protein, and serine protease  granzymes, particularly granzyme B (GrB). The DNA fragmentation into nucleosomal  fragments is the most recognizable biochemical feature of apoptotic cell death that  is regulated mainly by the DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) complex. DFF is composed  of an inhibitor molecule (DFF-45/ICAD) tightly associated with a nuclease known as  caspase-activated DNase (CAD/DFF-40/CPAN). Cleavage of the two caspase-3 specific  sites on DFF45 during apoptosis was shown to result in the release of DFF-40 and the  induction of DNA fragmentation. To investigate the ability of GrB to induce cell  death in a caspase-independent fashion, we first analyzed the importance of putative  caspase-3 cleavage sites within the DFF45 protein during apoptosis. In our study we  provide direct evidence that the cleavage of DFF45 after aspartic acid 117 (D117) is  both necessary and sufficient to induce DNA fragmentation through several apoptotic  stimuli. Site directed mutation of D117E completely blocked oligonucleosomal DNA  fragmentation without affecting other morphological and biochemical features of  apoptotic cell death. GrB shares with caspases the cleavage specificity for aspartic  acid at the P1 cleavage site. Based on our observations that (i) GrB cleaves DFF45  at the same site that is necessary and sufficient for the induction of DNA  fragmentation (D117) and (ii) DFF complex is constitutively localized in the  nucleus, we next investigated the ability of GrB to induce DNA fragmentation in the  absence of caspase activity. Using caspase-3 specific inhibitors, we show that GrB  indeed can directly target DFF45 protein and induces DNA fragmentation. More  importantly, we show the ability of GrB to directly cleave DFF45 and liberate CAD  endonuclease activity. Taken together, these results revealed a new apoptotic  pathway that provides a critical back-up system when the caspase pathway is  inhibited in the target cells by viral or tumor proteins.

By developing methodologies on database mining, we explored the  existence of MUtator (Mu)-Like Elements (MULEs) in  Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa. Mu elements were first discovered in Zea  mays; so far, a dozen of the elements have been identified in the genome. We  identified a total of 1392 MULEs from the sequenced Arabidopsis genome. They  represent one of the most abundant, diversified, yet still mobile DNA transposon  families in eukaryotes. The Arabidopsis MULEs are composed of not only the elements  showing the typical Mu-family-specific terminal structure (that is the long  Terminal Inverted Repeat, TIR), but also a  novel type of non-TIR MULEs. Some of this latter type of elements was found to be  active both transcriptionally and transpositionally. To understand host-mediated  genome-wide regulation(s) on the MULE system in Arabidopsis, we characterized 235  MULE mobility-specific genes (or mudrA-like genes) by mapping them on the sequenced  Arabidopsis chromosomes and performing a genome-wide expression assay utilizing  Arabidopsis METHYLTRANSFERSE1 (MET1) mutant (met2) plants, we showed that  MET1-mediated global CpG methylation can only repress a portion of the gene family;  its efficiency depends largely on the gene locations within the context of  Arabidopsis chromatin remodeling: stronger in heterochromatic regions but weaker in  euchromatic ones. This finding suggests that the Arabidopsis heterochromatic regions  are not just a graveyard for the accumulation of defective elements; rather, they  may have been playing an important role on the repression of TE activity via, at  least in part, exerting MET1-mediated silencing effect. Our expression analysis also  suggested that a TIR structure is not necessarily required for the MET1-mediated  si</description><creator>Yu, Zhihui, 1963-</creator><contributor>Buyeau, Thomas E.

When this partial isolation is maintained for many generations genetic  variability can be geographically structured. Populations of temperate-zone anuran  amphibians are often considered to be geographically isolated on relatively small  spatial scales due to the animals presumed high site fidelity and strict dependence  on moisture for respiration and breeding. As a result, temperate, pond-breeding  anuran amphibian populations are considered likely candidates to test hypotheses of  metapopulation theory, movement and phylogeography. Using data from the Fowler's  toad, (Bufo fowleri) I test the applicability of metapopulation theory, the  likelihood of limited movement and the strength of phylogeographic structure.  Specifically, I show that the generalization of the amphibians-as-metapopulations  paradigm, due to their limited dispersal capabilities, is not supported (I). Bufo  fowleri movement is well described by an inverse power function. Whereas most  individuals do not move, some move long distances. There is no sex bias to this  movement and I propose the hypothesis that the animals moving the longest distances  are aided by the passive action of lake currents (II). B. fowleri juveniles are not  a dispersal stage. They move neither farther nor faster than adults. The observation  of predominantly juvenile contribution to a dispersal pool is due to their  abundance---there are simply many more juveniles than adults (III). My observations  of amphibian population turnover do not support the predictions of two specific  metapopulation models when parameterized on a local (&lt;10km) or regional scale  (~300km) (IV).

The database needs to be  periodically updated to ensure its consistency with reality, since it reflects at  best a nominal state of the environment. This thesis presents an approach for  automatically updating the geometry of synthetic vision system databases and 3D  models in general. The approach is novel in that it profits from all of the  available prior information: intrinsic/extrinsic camera parameters and geometry of  the world. Geometric inconsistencies (or anomalies) between the model and reality  are quickly localized; this localization serves to significantly reduce the  complexity of the updating problem. Given a geometric model of the world, a sample  image and known camera motion, a predicted image can be generated based on a  differential approach. Model locations where predictions do not match observations  are assumed to be incorrect. The updating is then cast as an optimization problem  where differences between observations and predictions are minimized. To cope with  system uncertainties, a mechanism that automatically infers their impact on  prediction validity is derived. This method not only renders the anomaly detection  process robust but also prevents the overfitting of the data. The updating framework  is examined at first using synthetic data and further tested in both a laboratory  environment and using a helicopter in flight. Experimental results show that the  algorithm is effective and robust across different operating  conditions.</description><creator>Simard, Philippe</creator><contributor>Ferrie, Frank P.

The importance of caspase-6 was  confirmed by the fact that direct microinjection of recombinant active caspase-6  causes a protracted cell death in human neurons. Furthermore, an AD-related insult,  intracellular amyloid beta (Abeta)1-42 delivered by microinjection of Abeta  peptides, induces a rapid cell death mediated by caspase-6 in human neurons in  primary cultures. Based on the hypothesis that decreasing or suppressing neuronal  loss by inhibiting neuronal cell loss may benefit early AD patients in retaining  cognitive capacities and preventing or delaying disease progression, we have  searched approaches to inhibit caspase 6 activity. To inhibit active caspase-6,  several known neuroprotective hormones have been examined against caspase-6 toxicity  induced by microinjection of recombinant active caspase-6 into human neurons.  17-beta-estradiol, but not the transcriptionally inactive estrogen  17-alpha-estradiol, induces a caspase inhibitory factor (CIF) that inhibits active  caspase-3, -6, -7 and -8. CIF induction occurs through estrogen receptors, but does  not require de novo synthesis of protein. Furthermore, estrogen and androgen protect  neurons against intracellular Abeta1-42 toxicity through estrogen and androgen  receptors respectively through genomic activation. In summary, the present study directly proves the critical role  of active caspase-6 in human neuronal cell death and demonstrates the  neuroprotection of estrogen and androgen can be neuroprotective against  intracellular amyloid toxicity.</description><creator>Zhang, Yan, 1974-</creator><contributor>LeBlanc, Andrea (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Critial role of caspase-6 and inhibition of active caspase-6 by hormones in human neurons</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3484zh34h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qf85nb71f</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2r36tz04r</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:28:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Objective. To examine the temporal change in fetal death risk in  the U.S. from 1991 to 1997 and to assess the extent to which changes in registration  practices and labor induction have contributed to that change. Setting. United  States. Design. Cohort study. Participants. All singleton pregnancies 20--43 weeks  of gestation in 1991 and 1997. Main outcome measure. Fetal death risk (fetal deaths  per 10,000 fetuses at risk at each completed gestational week). Results. From 1991 to 1997, the overall fetal death rate fell  from 77.7 to 67.8 per 10,000 total births. However, fetal deaths at 20--22 weeks as  a proportion of total births increased from 14.5 to 16.9 per 10,000. In a Cox  regression analysis, the crude period effect (1997 vs 1991) at 40--43 weeks was 0.87  (95% CI 0.80--0.94) and remained virtually unchanged (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81--0.96)  after adjustment for maternal sociodemographic, medical, and lifestyle risk factors.  In ecologic (Poisson regression) analysis based on states as the unit of analysis,  the crude period effect in non-Hispanic Whites (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.74--0.84)  disappeared (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82--1.16) after adjusting for induction of labor. No  such effect of induction was observed in Blacks. Conclusions. Increased registration is probably responsible for  an increase in fetal death risk at 20--22 weeks of gestation, whereas the increasing  trend toward routine labor induction at and after term appears to have reduced the  risk of fetal death, at least among Whites.</description><creator>Yuan, Hongbo</creator><contributor>Kramer, Michael S.

There are two main contributions. First,  the concept of the visual map is developed, a representation of the visual structure  of the environment, and a framework for learning this structure is provided. Second,  methods for automatically constructing a visual map are presented for the case when  limited information is available about the position of the camera during data  collection. The core concept of this thesis is that of the visual map, which  models a set of image-domain features extracted from a scene. These are initially  selected using a measure of visual saliency, and subsequently modelled and evaluated  for their utility for robot pose estimation. Experiments are conducted demonstrating  the feature learning process and the inferred models' reliability for pose  inference. The second part of this thesis addresses the problem of  automatically collecting training images and constructing a visual map. First, it is  shown that visual maps are self-organizing in nature, and the transformation between  the image and pose domains is established with minimal prior pose information.  Second, it is shown that visual maps can be constructed reliably in the face of  uncertainty by selecting an appropriate exploration strategy. A variety of such  strategies are presented and these approaches are validated experimentally in both  simulated and real-world settings.</description><creator>Sim, Robert</creator><contributor>Dudek, Gregory (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2004</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><subject>Artificial Intelligence.</subject><title>On visual maps and their automatic construction</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f4752h21b.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dr26xx77t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):44225</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
