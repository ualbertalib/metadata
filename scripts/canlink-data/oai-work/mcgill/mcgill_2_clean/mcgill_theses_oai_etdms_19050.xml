In the thesis a study was made of the quartz eyes which occur at the base of the Intermediate Siltstone to determine their lateral distribution, their possible origin, and whether or not they have preferred optic orientation. The Sullivan mine Is on the south slope of Sullivan Hill, 1.5 miles north-west of the town of Kimberley in southeastern British Columbia, and 50 miles north of the International Boundary.</description><creator>Marler, Peter.</creator><contributor>Stevenson, J.

The rotations are superimposed upon the translational motions, thus causing the particles to undergo "cart wheel" or rolling movements. The type of rotational motion described by a particle is characteristic of its shape; the rotations are periodic and in the case of elongated particles result in preferred orientations. The two types of motion are of considerable interest in connection with viscosity thixotropy, flow anisotropy, particle aggregation etc., in solutions of macromolecules, colloidal sols and suspensions of large particles.</description><creator>Manley, Rockliffe.

The majority of the specimens, which are granitic, posses B-B' - tectonite fabrics comparable to those of other granulite areas. An important feature brought out by the diagrams is the lack of correspondance between the megascopic fabric axes, determined by lineation and foliation, and the fabric axes determined by the quartz diagrams.

For example, when a direct current is passed through a copper sulphate solution between two copper electrodes, copper dissolves from the anode and deposits upon the cathode.

Investigations concerned with the preservation of blood and the survival of red blood cells, and the use of plasma expanders were inaugurated in the Department of Biochemistry, at McGill University, soon after the onset of the second World War. From the time of its inauguration to the present, the various aspects of this research have been under the direction of Dr. O. F.

Prefrontal lobotomy is an operation involving bilateral subcortical section of the anterior portion of each frontal lobe. Patients selected to undergo this operation were those who were unresponsive to all other available treatments, and in whom the disease process appeared intractable.

Its task is to delineate the processes by which the genotype is ultimately resolved into the phenotype. In order to describe and explain the normal processes whereby this is accomplished, it has been necessary for the scientist in this field to investigate the abnormal. For this purpose, spontaneous deviations, mutants, have been the main objects of study. Recently, induced abnormalities have been added, to widen and stimulate investigation.</description><creator>Kalter, Harold.</creator><contributor>Fraser, F.

The ovum is of relatively enormous size and consists almost entirely of yolk material. It is surrounded by a complex of membranes comprising the albumen, the shell membranes and the shell.

Before examining the activities of this group in Parliament, it is necessary to consider, first, the problem caused by the retreat of Turkey from Europe and to examine, brietly, the factors which made up that problem. As soon as there appeared to be the slightest possibility of forcing the Turk out of Macedonia, three countries began to lay claims to that Turkish province.</description><creator>Jennings, Peter.

Further variations in composition were associated with such factors as the age of the tree, the height at which the bark sample was taken and the season of cutting. All attempts at elucidating the nature of the various bark components depended on the separation achieved by extraction with a variety of organic or aqueous solvents.</description><creator>Jablonski, Werner.
