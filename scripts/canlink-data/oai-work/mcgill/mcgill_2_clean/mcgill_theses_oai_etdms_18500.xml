Outstanding among the pioneer workers was Dareste who on the basis of extensive observations on the effects of temperature variations on chick embryos, concluded that teratogeny was always the consequence of a deviation from normal embryonic pathways, and that almost all malformations were caused by arrest of development. He further noted that induced defects in the chick closely resembled those found in mammals, especially in man.</description><creator>Clark, Karin Heiberg.</creator><contributor>Fraser, F.

The phenomenon of antibiosis, the production by one organism of a specific chemical substance or substances which have an injurious effect upon another organism, was noticed by many of the early microbiologists. Although Tyndall, Pasteur, and DeBary worked in different fields of biology, each mentioned this phenomenon of antibiosis in his writings.</description><creator>Wallen, Victor.

The medical profession is concerned about cleft palate because it is of sufficiently frequent occurrence to distress many people. Knowledge of the mechanisms and materials involved in palate development might be useful in designing preventive measures for prenatal care. The cleft palate condition is of interest to embryologists because it so often turns up in the list of defects caused by various teratogenic agents, and a better understanding of this defect would help in assessing the specific defects of a teratogenic substance.</description><creator>Walker, Bruce.

M. Fenneman, discussed what he called “the circumference of geography”. On that circumference Fenneman placed climatology, biogeography, commercial geography, political geography, mathematical geography, and physiography (geomorphology); all of which overlapped, in both data and techniques, the territories of related disciplines. If geography consisted of no more than an aggregate of these peripheral subjects, said Fenneman, it would have little right to exist.</description><creator>Thompson, Hugh.
