The partnership construction is identified in 4 interpretive communities within long-term community services to the elderly population. This analysis focuses on the placement decision for cognitively impaired clients in home care. Interpretive policy analysis is employed to examine 3 policy documents and 3 client files, while grounded theory serves to analyze 13 semi-structured interviews with 2 administrators and 3 open triads of client, caregiver, and case manager. The findings show partnership to be an egalitarian, collaborative ideal widely adopted but with little consensus on the pertinent objects and actors. Important differences emerge in how partnership is applied to the placement decision, indicating a too flexible application. Specific restrictions are recommended on the application of the partnership metaphor in order to improve community services and organizational structures in health care.</description><creator>Boxenbaum, Eva.</creator><contributor>Brotman, Shari (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Medical policy -- Québec (Province)</subject><subject>Older people with mental disabilities -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Nursing home care -- Québec (Province)</subject><title>The partnership metaphor in Quebec health care policy : the decision-making process with cognitively impaired elderly clients in home care</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4f16c4451.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h702q8066</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7s75df396</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:48:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In conformity with the principles laid down in article 26 of the Chicago Convention and its Annex 13 concerning technical aircraft accident investigations, the United States and France respectively set up and developed their own investigation Boards, the NTSB and the BEA, which may be different by their organization and functioning but both aim at the same objective: the promotion of Air Safety. To fulfil their complex mission in the best possible conditions and despite eventual pecuniary constraints, the pressure of the media, or the occasional tensions which may arise in case of concomitance with other investigations, the NTSB and the BEA rely on the renowned professionalism and high technical skills of their employees as well as on the participation in the investigation of members of the aeronautical industry who bring their expertise and contribute to the improvement of air safety.</description><creator>Lamy, Christophe A.</creator><contributor>Richard, Helene (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Aeronautics -- Safety measures.</subject><subject>France.

If that trend continues, there could be a major accident once a week by the year 2010. European States first joined their aviation policies for geographical and economical reasons. To that end, following the American deregulation, they started liberalizing their air transport. Today, they also work on the safety aspects of this activity. Together with the European Community and the DGCA's, three organisations have a relevant function in the regulation of safety: they help States to coordinate new preventive actions. Furthermore, in order to unify the measures that are currently implemented, a discussion on a single European aviation safety authority has been raised in the last few years. In the course of this thesis, the above-mentioned topics will be studied, whereby a preliminary chapter will focus on the origin of the unification of European air transport and the liberalization aspects, and the three following chapters will review the institutional and legal aspects of the safety of European air transport.</description><creator>Geoffroy, Marion.</creator><contributor>Weber, Ludwig (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Aeronautics -- Safety measures.</subject><subject>Aeronautics, Commercial -- Europe.</subject><subject>Aeronautics, Commercial -- Law and legislation -- Europe.</subject><title>La securite du transport aerien europeen : aspects institutionnels et juridiques</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5d86p2111.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v692t813b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7d278w000</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:48:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>To date, the debate concerning the aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Quebec has focussed primarily on the assertion of the territorial integrity of Quebec on the one hand, and the assertion that those rights can prevent secession or force partition, on the other. Understanding the historical and contemporary relationship between aboriginal peoples and the governments of Canada and Quebec is necessary if a rapprochement between these adversarial positions is to be achieved. This paper explores the legal and historical basis of aboriginal rights, focussing on self-government and the fiduciary relationship between aboriginal peoples and the Crown. It discusses international law principles under which Quebec will seek recognition as an independent state and the relevance of aboriginal rights to that recognition. Finally, it urges that the current debate provides an opportunity to establish a new partnership between Quebec and aboriginal peoples, to their mutual benefit.</description><creator>Grenier, Guylaine.</creator><contributor>Gaudreault-Desbiens, Jean-Francois (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Québec (Province) -- Politics and government.</subject><subject>Indigenous peoples -- Québec (Province) -- Politics and government.</subject><subject>Indigenous peoples -- Québec (Province) -- Government relations.</subject><title>Le droit des peuples autochtones à l'autonomie gouvernementale dans le contexte de l'accession du Québec à la souveraineté /</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dz010r974.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7d278w000</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4j03d177j</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:48:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The setting of an 'age of criminal responsibility' by States across the international spectrum is a formal recognition that children do not possess the same mental capacity to comprehend the extent of the criminality of their actions, and their implications, as adults. Any such legal threshold which abruptly deems a child 'criminally responsible' upon the dawning of a birthday is inherently arbitrary, yet a necessary legal fiction. The central conundrum addressed by this discussion is "which direction?"---at what age should policy-makers draw the line. Should legislators be advocating low ages of criminal responsibility, or should they be championing higher ages? An examination of the juvenile justice regimes of the UK and Canada provides an informative backdrop against which to base a sound conclusion: higher ages of criminal responsibility should be adopted in order to counteract and safeguard against the current climate of 'zero tolerance' and retributive 'just deserts' currently motivating youth justice policy.</description><creator>Lees, Charlotte.</creator><contributor>Healy, Patrick (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Juvenile justice, Administration of -- Great Britain.</subject><subject>Criminal liability -- Great Britain.</subject><subject>Criminal liability -- Canada.</subject><subject>Juvenile justice, Administration of -- Canada.</subject><title>The age of criminal responsibility, which direction? : a comparative study of the United Kingdom and Canada</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3x816p27h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d177j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2z10ws05q</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:49:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The presence of hospital foundations inside a public healthcare system raises the question of whether they are charitable organisations doing charitable acts and how they differ from state institutions. A charitable act is based on the notion of gift. A gift relationship, compared to a commercial relationship, is founded on sharing and mutual responsibility rather than common interests. Among friends and relatives, giving reveals strong and lively relationships. In modern society, giving also takes place between strangers. It reveals strong community ties. The charitable sector, including hospital foundations, is the most common form of giving among strangers. Those who participate in this sector show a high level of involvement in many sectors of society and have strong community ties. State action takes place irrespective of the quality of community ties, although it ultimately depends on it. Charitable action complements state action. However, state action remains essential since charity is alien to the concepts of justice and equity.</description><creator>Laroche, Vincent.</creator><contributor>Macdonald, Roderick A.

The notion is understood differently in distinct jurisdictions. Nevertheless, corporate governance widely refers to the way corporations are managed. The present study firstly concentrates on the United States since the latter has been the first country to host debates on the topic. Different governance models basically distinguish the North-American and European (Continental Europe) governance systems. However, debates in the United States and Canada concentrate on distinct issues. The third studied country, France has also its own characteristics. International organisations' initiatives on the topic such as the OECD, illustrate the importance given to "corporate governance". Although the uniformity of distinct national governance systems is not likely to be reached in the near future, certain similarities might be pointed at, especially through the recent activism of institutional shareholders.</description><creator>Inal, Burcu.</creator><contributor>Smith, Lionel (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Corporate governance -- Canada.</subject><subject>Corporate governance -- United States.</subject><subject>Corporate governance -- France.</subject><title>Corporate governance in the United States, Canada and France</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tt44pp842.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5h73px82v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ws859h40m</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:49:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Background. Up to 1600 Canadians/yr suffer a serious complication due to the diagnostic test ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) used in the management of patients with suspected biliary obstruction. MRCP (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography) is a new highly accurate noninvasive alternative that is not associated with any significant complications. Aims. To assess the real-life effectiveness and costs of MRCP versus ERCP in a planned interim analysis of a randomized clinical trial, in intermediate risk patients. To assist in the decision regarding study continuation versus termination. Methods. 200 patients with a clinical and/or ultrasonographic (US) suspicion of obstruction were randomized to MRCP or ERCP, using block allocation stratified by level of obstruction. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of a negative outcome attributable to the biliopancreatic disease or procedures within 12 months of randomization. Secondary outcomes included complication-related length of stay (CRLOS), number of procedures, costs, mortality and accuracy. Results. 102 patients were randomized to MRCP and 98 to ERCP with mean ages of 56.4 +/- 18 (SD) and 51.8 +/- 19 yrs, respectively. Median follow-up was 12 months. According to intention-to-treat analysis, 18 (17.6%) MRCP patients had a complication (CRLOS = 0.80 d/patient (excluding 1 outlier with CRLOS = 157d) versus 14 (14.3%) ERCP patients (CRLOS = 0.68d/patient); difference = 3.3% (95%CI: -7 to 13%). There were 45 fewer ERCPs but 90 extra MRCPs in the MRCP arm. ERCP was "dominant", with both marginally lower complications and lower costs by $1411/person (ITT). There was neither evidence for confounding nor effect modification. Conclusions. In this interim analysis, it appears that a strategy that involves a screening MRCP in this group of patients is not cost-effective. The results of this primary analysis are unlikely to change with the recruitment of 200 additional patients into the trial.</description><creator>Romagnuolo, Joseph.</creator><contributor>Joseph, L.

The use of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in studying central auditory pathways expanded our knowledge of the neurophysiology of hearing. In various studies, an array of diverse auditory stimuli has been used, including pure tones and words, in a "Block" design. Few studies, thus far, have been performed using an event-related design. None of these has used pure tone stimulation. Subjects and methods. In eight out of 13 subjects enrolled and scanned in this project, data have been acquired and processed. Binaural pure tone stimulation at 2kHz and one higher frequency at 6, 8, or 12 kHz, at 90 dB SPL was presented to all subjects, using a stroboscopic design in an attempt to eliminate cortical response to scanning noise. In addition, an unusually long time of repetition (TR) interval of 10 seconds was utilized. The aim in data processing was to generate: (a) a Peak Height Map (PHM) with selection of areas of stimulation based on the maximal response; (b) a statistical map from the raw data of the images. Results. No consistent morphology was detected in the BOLD event-related curves, corresponding to the percentage change from baseline over time. Such curves revealed significant oscillation with marked dips below baseline, highly suggestive of an irregular noise pattern. Comparing the curves to each other, no discernible shape or similarities were noted. Conclusion. Attempting to extract both the temporal and spatial characteristics of the cortical response to pure tone stimuli resulted in a dispersal of data over many parameters, therefore "diluting" it. This, in turn, yielded a negative result where the responses were "drowned" revealing but a noise pattern.</description><creator>Samaha, Mark.</creator><contributor>Katsarkas, Athanasios (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Radiology.</subject><title>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the auditory cortex : an event-related study using pure tone stimulation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gm80hx231.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dj52w659q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Otolaryngology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3j333417f</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:49:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Dynamic beam delivery (DBD), either in the step-and-shoot or dynamic mode, promises to be useful for developing conformal radiotherapy techniques. The introduction of DBD in the clinic requires stringent evaluation of the DBD system before any dynamic technique can be performed clinically. In this work, a series of quality assurance tests were performed to evaluate a DBD system (DBD Toolbox) on a linear accelerator. The results of the tests have shown that the DBD Toolbox is capable of precisely controlling jaw motion, collimator rotation, and gantry rotation for dynamic beam delivery to within a 1 mm tolerance for jaw motion and 0.5° tolerance for collimator or gantry rotation. In addition, a simple model for dynamic jaw dosimetry was evaluated. The quality assurance tests and model evaluation are presented in this thesis.</description><creator>Ruo, Russell L.</creator><contributor>Evans, M. D. C.

We chose for a Lagrangian a polynomial in the curvature tensor of degree at most two. For compact surfaces we show that all solutions of the field equations must be locally symmetric. We then develop an equivalence between symmetric symplectic surfaces and symplectic symmetric triples and determine the list of isomorphism classes of two dimensional symplectic symmetric triples.</description><creator>Roche, Austin D.</creator><contributor>Kamran, Niky (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Mathematics.</subject><title>On a natural variational principle for symplectic connections</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5x21th23x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s4655j38g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:br86b515w</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:49:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In dairy cattle, treatment with exogenous growth hormone (GH) affects growth and function of mammary gland. The actions of GH are mediated via interaction with GH receptors (GHR). The first step in signal transduction is homodimerization of two GHR molecules by GH. This step is critical since mutation in either GH or GHR can block dimerization and thus target cell activation. However, association between milk related traits and combination of GH and GHR variations are not known. Accordingly, DNA genotypes in the GH and GHR genes were investigated for association with milk, fat and protein lactation yields in Holsteins. The marker data were obtained on 873 progeny tested bulls by using PCR-RFLP and PCR-SSCP analysis. There were five markers in GH and three in GHR. Estimated breeding values (EBVs) were obtained from Canadian Dairy Network for milk, fat, and protein lactation yields for the 873 genotyped bulls. There was significant difference among GH6.1 alleles (C-to-G transversion at position 2141) for the milk yield (P &lt; 0.05) and protein yield (p &lt; 0.05). There were significant differences in GHR AluI (A-to-T transversion at -1182) for milk (p &lt; 0.05) and fat (p &lt; 0.05), and GHR StuI (C-to-T transversion at -232) for fat (p &lt; 0.0001) and protein (p &lt; 0.05). Allele frequencies for GH6.1 (C), GHR AluI (A) and GHR StuI (C) alleles in bulls genotyped were 0.95, 0.63 and 0.95, respectively.

This is particularly true in establishing the timing of infection in pregnant women and in demonstrating reactivation of disease in immunocompromised hosts. The wide tissue tropism and distinct life-cycle stages of toxoplasmosis raise the possibility that the detection of circulating tachyzoite antigens may be of use in these situations. We have developed a series of antigen capture Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs) using a panel of novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against T. gondii tachyzoite antigens. Using a pool of these mAbs to capture whole tachyzoite lysate antigen in 'spiked' negative serum, the detection limit of our ELISA was 1--2mug/ml of protein. The sensitivity of this ELISA was 52% (n = 412). We postulated that our low sensitivity was mainly due to circulating immune complexes. This was confirmed by the disappearance of 'spiked' tachyzoite lysate antigen in antibody positive samples followed by the reappearance of antigen upon 12% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) treatment. Furthermore, the use of 12% TCA significantly increased antigen detection (p = 0.00001). Preliminary results suggested that assay sensitivity was 96% (n = 254) while assay specificity was 97% (n = 253). Early reports suggest that Toxoplasma antigen levels in serum are transient. The magnitude and kinetics of antigenemia with the specific Toxoplasma products recognized by our panel of mAbs remain to be determined. This optimized assay can now be used to test sera from otherwise healthy and immunocompromised subjects to determine its clinical utility.</description><creator>Grushka, Daniel</creator><contributor>Ward, Brian J.

The regulatory subunit (RSU) was uniformly labeled with 13C/15N and then reconstituted with the unlabeled catalytic subunit (CSU) to form the holoenzyme. The activity of the holoenzyme was shown to be unaffected by the isotopic labeling of the RSU. The VT-FTIR investigation of the isolated CSU and the CSU in the holoenzyme revealed that the CSU is more thermally stable when bound to the RSU (i.e., in the holoenzyme). The RSU also showed more thermal stability when bound to the CSU. The sequences of events leading to the unfolding of the isolated CSU and RSU and the CSU in the holoenzyme were deduced by 2D correlation analysis of the VT-FTIR spectra. The results for the isolated CSU demonstrated that beta-sheets unfold first, followed by a-helices and then turns, and finally aggregates form. The sequence of unfolding of the RSU showed an increase of turns followed by a loss of intramolecular beta sheets, then a loss of alpha-helices and the formation of aggregates. The CSU in the holoenzyme exhibited a slightly different unfolding pathway and was observed to unfold subsequent to the unfolding of the RSU, consistent with the two thermal transitions observed by differential scanning calorimetry.</description><creator>Haque, Takrima.</creator><contributor>Ismail, Ashraf A.

This study examines two showings with contrasting mineralization styles. The Ryne showing is underlain by intermediate to felsic metavolcaniclastic rocks, and features a brittle-ductile shear zone with disseminated low-grade gold mineralization, whereas the Hourglass showing contains high concentrations of gold disseminated in narrow felsic dykes. Mineralization proceeded with an initial stage of pyritization, which decreased aH2S and fO 2 of the fluid, while coeval carbonatization decreased the pH. These changes in physico-chemical parameters lead to the second mineralization stage, in which pyrite was replaced by arsenopyrite and pyrrhotite. Chalcopyrite and gold co-precipitated and both replaced pyrite. The decrease in aH2S, which reduced Au(HS)2- and Cu(HS)2- stabilities, was the principal control of gold and chalcopyrite deposition. The absence of copper in most mesothermal deposits is explained by the extreme solubility of this metal as a bisulfide complex, which prevents its precipitation as chalcopyrite. The rare occurrence of chalcopyrite at Onaman reflects unusually low solubility of copper due to the combined effects of an abnormally low initial pH of the fluid and a low fluid/rock ratio.</description><creator>Grondin, Olivier.</creator><contributor>Williams-Jones, Anthony E.

NC, RHD and LHD subjects performed a cross-modal lexical decision task, in which they heard sentence contexts that were biased toward the dominant or subordinate meanings of ambiguous words occurring before the end of the sentence. Written target words related to the dominant or subordinate meaning of the ambiguous words were introduced either at the onset of the ambiguous word (immediate condition), or 1000 ms later (delayed condition). Results revealed that both dominant and subordinate meanings were primed in the immediate condition, irrespective of context type or group. In the delayed condition, only the contextually-appropriate dominant meanings were primed in normal control subjects, whereas both patient groups showed significant priming only for the contextually-inappropriate dominant meanings. Findings for the NC subjects are interpreted in support of a modular model of lexical ambiguity resolution, and more specifically of an exhaustive access view. Patients' results are discussed with reference to a delayed suppression mechanism of inappropriate meanings, which is thought to be involved in these patients' language comprehension deficits.</description><creator>Barrette, Martine.</creator><contributor>Baum, S.

We evaluated the involvement of NO synthases (NOS) and heme oxygenases (HO) in nitrosative and oxidative stresses in sepsis-induced diaphragmatic contractile dysfunction. Sepsis was elicited by injecting rats and transgenic mice deficient in either inducible (iNOS) or neuronal (nNOS) isoforms with 20 mg/kg E. coli lipolysaccharide (LPS). Peroxynitrite formation was monitored by measuring nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity with selective antibodies. Oxidative stress was assessed by measuring protein oxidation (carbonyl groups), lipid peroxidation (hydoxynonenal protein adducts), and muscular glutathione concentrations. HO expression was evaluated using anti-HO-1 and -HO-2 antibodies, and biological significance using HO inhibitor, and contractility studies. We conclude that the iNOS isoform plays a major role in nitrotyrosine formation and protein oxidation in septic ventilatory muscles, and that HO protect muscle contractile machinery from the deleterious effects of ROS in control and septic muscles.</description><creator>Barreiro, Esther.</creator><contributor>Hussain, Sabah N.

Using Jurkat cells engineered to inducibly express a transdominant form of IkappaBalpha (TD-IkappaBalpha), we have found two novel genes regulated NF-kappaB transcription factor, interleukin 13 and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) apoptotic signaling protein. Treatment with a variety of T cell receptor mimetics resulted in a rapid and dramatic increase in the expression of TRAIL mRNA as well as cell surface protein. The induced expression of TRAIL was linked to the presence of a c-Rel binding site at position -256 to -265. Mutation of this site or an adjacent kappaB site resulted in a complete loss of inducibility of the TRAIL promoter. The regulation of TRAIL expression may represent a general mechanism that contributes to the control of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in T lymphocytes.</description><creator>Baetu, Tudor Mihai.</creator><contributor>Hiscott, John (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Expression of cytokine and apoptotic genes : a role for NF-kB in the regulation of TNF- related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) expression</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bv73c2375.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0r9675439</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:dz010r98d</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:49:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The technique of ion transfer in radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) systems is described.

The quality improvement is focused on the efficient coding scheme of voiced speech segments, while keeping the basic coding format intact. In the WI paradigm voiced speech is modelled as a concatenation of the Slowly Evolving pitch-cycle Waveforms (SEW). Vector quantization is the optimal approach to encode the SEW magnitude at low bit rates, but its complexity imposes a formidable barrier. Product code vector quantizers (PC-VQ) are a family of structured VQs that circumvent the complexity obstacle. The performance of product code VQs can be traded off against their storage and encoding complexity. This thesis introduces split/shape-gain VQ---a hybrid product code VQ, as an approach to quantize the SEW magnitude. The amplitude spectrum of the SEW is split into three non-overlapping subbands. The gains of the three subbands form the gain vector which are quantized using the conventional Generalized Lloyd Algorithm (GLA). Each shape vector obtained by normalizing each subband by its corresponding coded gain is quantized using a dimension conversion VQ along with a perceptually based bit allocation strategy and a perceptually weighted distortion measure. At the receiver, the discontinuity of the gain contour at the boundary of subbands introduces buzziness in the reconstructed speech. This problem is tackled by smoothing the gain versus frequency contour using a piecewise monotonic cubic interpolant. Simulation results indicate that the new method improves speech quality significantly. The necessity of SEW phase information in the WI coder is also investigated in this thesis. Informal subjective test results demonstrate that transmission of SEW magnitude encoded by split/shape-gain VQ and inclusion of a fixed phase spectrum drawn from a voiced segment of a high-pitched male speaker obviates the need to send phase information.</description><creator>Khan, Mohammad M.

The 3D orbital navigator method proposed addresses the speed requirements of a fast acquisition technique, namely echo planar imaging (EPI), used in functional MRI. Three orthogonal magnetic field gradient pulses were designed and implemented to produce circular sampling trajectories in the volume of the resonating spins of the subject under study. The variations in phase and magnitude of the subsequent navigator data samples serve as markers for motion occurring between repeated acquisitions. Algorithms to estimate the parameters of motion from the navigator signals were developed and their correctness and stability in the presence of noise were tested by means of numerical simulation. The phantom studies involving controlled rotation and displacement of an inhomogeneous test object during an MRI acquisition established the technique's accuracy. In-vivo experiments showed that the navigator echoes can be used in measuring the gross patient movement, as well as in monitoring the small displacements that may correlate with the respiratory cycle.</description><creator>Khalili Mahani, Najmeh.</creator><contributor>Pike, G.

Our task is to verify whether locally optimized modules can replace parts of an existing circuit under certain assumptions regarding the operation of the optimized modules in context. Two main difficulties in verifying peephole optimizations are state explosion in the implementation models and increased complexity of the interfaces of optimized modules. A novel technique is proposed for constructing in a modular manner specifications and functional models of pulse-mode circuits. A verification rule related to assume-guarantee and hierarchical verification is presented, using relative timing constraints as optimization assumptions. We present two case studies to illustrate the proposed techniques: verification of speed-optimizations in an asynchronous arbiter, and verification of one step of communication refinement in a globally asynchronous, locally synchronous (GALS) architecture.</description><creator>Kong, Xiaohua, 1974-</creator><contributor>Negulescu, Radu (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Formal verification of peephole optimization in asynchronous circuits</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fj2363918.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w0892c65d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mp48sf447</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:49:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The challenges encountered while designing the silicon ASICs for three short reach optical interconnects will be described.

The first one is the story of Jonas. The day of his solemn vows, Jonas leaves the monastery after having seen a woman who has awaken in him a desire of freedom absent until then. The second tells the story of Denise, a waitress in a restaurant stuck in a feeling of deep solitude. She regains contact with the world through a cat that awakes in her the desire to share her life. The third story will be of Maryse, the woman whom Jonas saw. Maryse is a country girl who had left her small town to live with her fiance in the city. She leaves him to regain the purity and calm of her small country town. The last story is the story of Jean, Maryse's fiance. After she leaves, he goes looking for his missing cat, witch will lead him to Denise. The notion of chance is omnipresent in the works of Milan Kundera.

Various mystics have conceived of this journey in different ways. For one early Sufi, al-Ḥakim al-Tirmidhi, this journey is conceived as an inward one through the concentric circles of the Heart. The focus of this thesis is on Tirmidhi's maqamat al-qalb, the "Stations of the Heart" as described in his work the Bayan al-Farq Bayn al-Ṣadr wa al-Qalb wa al-Fu'ad wa al-Lubb (The Elucidation of the Differences Between the Chest, the Heart, the Inner Heart, and the Intellect). To appraise Tirmidhi's elucidation, the discussion begins with a mentioning of the concept of the Heart in the Near East before Islam (in the Ancient Egyptian, Hindu, and Jewish traditions) and Tirmidhi's Muslim precursors and contemporaries who also dealt with this topic. Explication of the Bayan al-Farq itself is centered on the text itself, which follows an initial discussion of the usage of the terms ṣadr, qalb, fu'ad, and lubb in the Arabic language as well as a discussion of how the terms are used in the Qur'an. Central to the subject matter of the Bayan al-Farq is not only Tirmidhi's elucidation of the differences between these layers of the Heart, but also his concepts of light and knowledge ( nur and ma'rifat).</description><creator>Pavlis, Natalie A.</creator><contributor>Ormsby, Eric L.
