The many similarities between anaphylactic reactions and the manifest actions of "histamine liberators" suggest that these two conditions produce their effects in the same way: ie. by the activation of an enzyme system.

The first course was given in 1950 and the second one was given in 1951. Different techniques were used in each year. The 1950 course may be described as mechanical and task-oriented. The 1951 course, on the other hand, had a clinical orientation.

An apparatus was built to follow the decomposition of benzene-diazo-acetate in solution by measuring the pressure of the nitrogen evolved in a constant volume system - the evolution of air from solution occurred simultaneously due to an initial decrease in pressure to protect the system. One of two otherwise similar cells was fitted with electrodes for application of an electric field. 2. The rate of pressure increase for a concentration of 0.4 g. per 1. was greatly accelerated by an electric field of 3000 volts per cm. and 1.5 megacycles. The effect of the field decreased rapidly as the concentration was increased, and at 1.6 g. per 1. the acceleration was barely discernible. The greatest effect was obtained for the gas evolution alone. [...]</description><creator>Yates, Havelock Howard.</creator><contributor>Winkler, C.A.

The effects of nitrogen compounds, carbohydrates and growth factors, on the metabolism of the isolated strains were studied.

A study was carried out on the closely linked mutants miniature, dusky and miniature-dominant in Drosophila melanogaster. 2. The viability of miniature-dominant was measured for homozygous and heterozygous females and for hemizygous males. Evidence is presented that the death of such zygotes oceurs before hatching of the eggs. 3. Crossing over experiments showed a probable cross over between miniature and dusky but no crossing over between miniature-dominant and miniature or miniature-dominant and dusky. 4. Allelism was found to be shown between miniature-dominant and dusky, miniature-dominant and miniature, miniature-dominant and miniature259- 4, and miniature and miniature259- 4 5. The phenotypes of miniature dusky/+ + and miniature +/+dusky were found to differ and a position effect apparently occurs. 6. These mutants are compared to those at the lozenge, Star, and bithorax loci and the possibility that miniature and dusky represent repeated loci is considered.</description><creator>Willermet, David.</creator><date>1952</date><subject></subject><subject>Biology.</subject><title>Determination of the Locus of Miniature Dominant, a New Alliele in Drosophila Melanogaster.</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mg74qr133.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jq085q09s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:37720h90v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T21:15:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The past decade has witnessed a renewal of interest in the psychology of perception.
