Airway closure was assessed by a single-breath N2 technique, gas exchange by A-aD02, venous admixture, and cardiac output (dye-dilution). Functional residual capacity (FRC) was measured by a helium technique. A posture change from seated to supine produced changes of lung volumes allowing functional effects of airway closure to be isolated. Closing volume (lung volume where airway closure starts to occur) was unchanged with posture while FRC fell in the supine position. When airway closure occured below FRC in both postures, gas exchange was improved in the supine posture. When airway closure involved increased lung volumes above FRC with the posture change, there was deterioration of supine gas exchange. It was concluded that airway closure was a factor tending to impair gas exchange. These findings disagree with previous reports of posture and gas exchange, which failed to consider effects of airway closure.</description><creator>Craig, Douglas B.</creator><contributor>Becklake, M.

The catecholamines, adrenaline, noradrenaline and isoprenaline, are known to increase the level of cyclic AMP in the heart before the maximum of their inotropic effect is reached, and it has been suggested that cyclic AMP is a mediator of the effect on contractility. The catecholamines act on cardiac beta adrenergic receptors. Phenylephrine, which is not a catecholamine, is known to act on alpha and beta adrenergic receptors in mammalian myocardium. In the chicken heart no evidence of alpha receptors was found in this study. The effect of phenylephrine on the formation of cyclic AMP from ATP was studied in rabbit and chicken heart homogenate. The drug did not significantly increase the level of cyclic AMP although it was as effective as the catecholamines in increasing contractility of the isolated heart. This result makes it unlikely that sympathomimetic drug effects on cardiac contractility are mediated by cyclic AMP. Cyclic AMP is known to be involved in glycogen breakdown, and it was found that adrenaline which increases cardiac cyclic AMP levels reduces cardiac glycogen concentration in the isolated perfused rabbit heart, while phenylephrine which does not increase the level of cardiac cyclic AMP, does not reduce the concentration of cardiac glycogen.</description><creator>Carolin, Ted</creator><contributor>Benfey, B.

Each child was tested over twelve sessions under each of the following conditions: vision, audition, vision supplemented by optimal audition, and vision supplemented by suboptimal audition. Speech material was presented by videotape and subjects responded by operating a same-different response device. Discrimination was better under bisensory conditions than under either unisensory condition. Vision supplemented by optimal audition was superior to vision supplemented by suboptimal audition. There was no significant difference between visual and auditory conditions. Dental consonants were visually discriminable when contrasted with alveolar consonants, and the vowels /a/ and /i/ had a more positive influence on consonant discrimination than /u/. Subjects' discrimination improved, and their response times decreased over training sessions. Pre- and post-tests of word recognition indicated that experimental subjects, compared to a control group, did not generalize from learning over the training program.</description><creator>Birtles, Gregory J.</creator><contributor>Ling, D.

Glucagon given over 10 days lowered plasma total cholesterol significantly in types III, V, lIa and lIb but neither in II homozygous nor in IV, as compared with the control period (5 days). Glucagon lowered plasma triglycerides significantly in types III and V but produced only a transient fall followed by a progressive rise in type lIa, lIb and IV. A statistically significant positive correlation was observed between the peak of glucose increase after a single dose of glucagon and after an oral load of glucose (100 gm).

In human prostatic tissue the LDH isoenzymatic changes were noted to be most reliable for diagnosing malignancy at an LDH V/LDH l ratio of 3.5 and over. The results of the serum studies were of no conclusive diagnostic value. In the golden hamster an SV 40 virus transformed hamster prostatic tumor was noted to possess a controversial resemblance with human prostatic cancer. Progestational agents seem to have interesting therapeutic possibilities and further investigative studies on their role in prostatic cancer is suggested. A transplantable prostatic carcinoma of benign human origin transformed by methyl cholanthrene has been successfully propagated in the golden hamster.

Floatability of the resultant hematite was determined using a new type of laboratory test cell. Amine adsorption followed a Freundlich type isotherm, T = KC^n , n varying with pH and starch concentration. Adsorption increased with pH, especially at pH 8 - 10, and was enhanced by starch at low pH. Starch decreased amine adsorption at high pH. Starch adsorption increased with concentration and rose with amine concentration to 10^-4 molar. Higher amine concentrations lowered starch adsorption. Floatability increased with amine concentration up to 10^-3 molar and fell at 10^-2 molar amine. Maximum flotation was achieved in slightly alkaline solution. Starch was most effective as a depressant at high and low pH but the maximum floatability value was little affected. Starch produced a shift of the maximum floatability peak to higher pH levels. An explanation, based on amine-starch complexing, is proposed.</description><creator>Partridge, Anthony C.</creator><contributor>Smith G.

Ce monde des objets et des environnements est la representation physique et littéraire de la détermination humaine par le milieu. Zola, qui en aborde au départ l'étude avec des pretentions scientifiques, découvre rapidement que les objets constituent un monde vivant. Dès lors, il s'applique à dégager la vie des objets et à la transposer dans son oeuvre. Représentation systématique du tout par une partie privilégiés,emploi d'un vocabulaire particulier, grossissement, répétition, généralisation, autant de procédés épiques qu'il utilise pour charger certains objets d'une valeur symbolique et lyrique, et pour les animer, au point d'en faire des personnages romanesques.</description><creator>Henry, Jacques F.</creator><contributor>Jones, H.

Maximal adsorption of reagins was obtained on incubation of serum and polymer for 75 min. For recovery of the adsorbed reagins, 2 M KSCN was shown to be a more effective eluting agent than 2 M KI and near quantitative recoveries were obtained by incubation of the immunoadsorbent-antibody complexes with this reagent for 75 min. The specificity of the immunoadsorbent was demonstrated in experiments with a mixed grass- and ragweed-sensitive serum. Under optimal conditions, recoveries of 35 to 60% of the initial reagin content of 3 ragweed atopic sera were obtained. The antigen E polymer was shown to be capable of multiple immunoadsorptions following regeneration by washing with 2 M KSCN. Finally, the polymer was employed to isolate reagins in a more highly purified state from a DEAE-cellulose fraction of ragweed atopic serum.</description><creator>Tannenbaum, Marion</creator><contributor>Goodfriend, L.

Using CBA "filtered" cells and C57BL normal spleen cells, derived from thymectomized, x-irradiated, and bone marrow protected mice; utilizing iso-antisera directed against CBA or C57BL cells the following was established: the C57BL spleen provided the majority of the precursors of PFC as well as an " adherent", radio-resistant cell; neither of these 2 cells were thymus dependent.

A contralateral nephrectomy was performed simultaneously. The post-operative effect of ischemia was followed with serial serum creatinine determinations and serial 131I hippuran renograms. Each animal was followed for four weeks from the date of the operation, or until death. An attempt was made to define the ischemic tolerance of the canine kidney. At the same time, correlation between serum creatinine and renogram was attempted, to determine the validity of the latter in evaluating renal function. No detectable renal damage was noticed in control and 1/2 hour ischemia groups. A variable amount of reversible renal insufficiency was evident in ischemia groups of 1-2 hours duration. The 50 % lethal dose of complete renal ischemia was demonstrated to be two hours. A qualitative classification of renograms was developed, and this was shown to correlate well with other parameters of renal function. The renogram was found to be particularly reliable in the acute phase of renal damage.

A group in which the joint was stored at -200C for one to four weeks and then homotransplanted. iii. Similar to group 2, but in addition the graft was irradiated at some point during storage. iv. Similar to group 2, but in addition the recipient was placed on an immunosuppressant agent post-operatively. Immune studies with respect to circulating and cell-bound antibodies to cartilage were also carried out. When each group was examined radiologically, clinically, and histologically, group 1 did the best, followed in turn by group 3, group 4 and finally group 2. We therefore concluded that immunological factors do play a role in the late degenerative changes seen and this was specifically related to the degree and rate of bone replacement and subsequent preservation of joint architecture. The cartilage did not appear to be highly antigenic.</description><creator>Seligman, Gerald</creator><contributor>Creuss, R.

The medium contained one amino acid, L-glutamic acid, as organic nitrogen source in addition to basal salts and glucose. In the preparation of cells for growth studies, a diluting fluid was chosen from several investigated which best protected the viability of the cells. Granules containing inorganic polyphosphate were found in the cells during the logarithmic and stationary phases of growth. These structures were isolated with the aid of an alkaline hypochlorite solution. The fatty acids of their lipid fraction were analysed by gas chromatography. The main fatty acids were chain length 14 to 18 carbon atoms.</description><creator>Rutter, Penelope J.</creator><contributor>Chan, E.

Two types of evoked response were seen - the large, rapidly habituating myogenic response i.e. Preyer Reflex Evoked Response (PRER) and the smaller, slowly habituating neurogenic response i.e. Evoked Cortical Response (ECR). The two evoked responses were shown to be different. Only the ECR (mean latency 37 msec) was used in evoked response audiometry. Audiograms were drawn up for each animal and a composite audiogram determined. The composite audiogram compares favorably with the audiograms drawn by the behavioral investigators. Pure tone threshold boundaries were calculated based on those animals whose cochleograms were normal. Using kanamycin and streptomycin, the receptor responsible for the ECR was found to be the cochlea. The vestibular system seemed to play no observable role.</description><creator>Rubin, Allan</creator><contributor>Gannon, R.

Case studies of the New York Bureau of Municipal Research, the Borough of Richmond, the United States Department of Defense and the Canadian Treasury Board are conducted because of their special significance. The study is divided into two parts. The first part describes the circumstances leading to the evolution of PPBS. Similar reform movements that were going on in Canada are briefly discussed and a special effort is made to assess the impact of the transplantation of PPBS in the Canadian system. The second part attempts to portray PPBS decision making both in theory and practice, the main aim being to relate PPBS policy alternative selection to political reality. An empirical study was conducted in the Canadian Treasury Board to test several hypotheses that portray PPBS as a hybrid rather than a rational or an incremental budgeting model.</description><creator>Milkias, Paulos</creator><contributor>Bruneau, T.

Two groups of dogs were fasted for 24 hours, then given intravenous injections of a suspension of E. coli bacteria. When severe bacteremia with prostration was evident, thoracic duct lymph, blood, liver and lung extracts were assayed for triglyceride, cholesterol and free fatty acids. While thoracic duct lymph showed little change, there was a significant increase in triglycerides in the other specimens. It is postulated that in sepsis the liver is unable to handle the marked mobilization of lipid that occurs. Triglyceride with minimal or abnormal protein binding is released via the hepatic veins into the circulation. Increased lung triglyceride and pulmonary fat embolism may be explained on this basis.</description><creator>Milne, George C.</creator><contributor>Duff, J.

Highest grain yields resulted from seeding prior to the last week in May or during early July. A seeding rate of 34-50 kg./ha. in 20-cm. drills was optimum, and the crop responded well to additions of fertilizer on low fertility soils. Harvesting date tests indicated that maximum grain yield in buckwheat is realized at a relatively early stage and remains stable over a period of 3-4 weeks. Attempts to harvest prior to Frost killing, however, gave rise to difficulties since conventional grain harvesting equipment is not designed to handle high moisture plant material. Treatment of buckwheat with the growth regulator, Ethrel, showed few beneficial effects.</description><creator>Martin, James W.</creator><contributor>Klinck, H.

Disease onset was accentuated by prior splenectomy. Deposition of isogeneic and xenogeneic antigen (FIA) host gamma globulin and complement were demonstrated along the glomerular basement membrane by immunofluorescence techniques. Ultrastructural examination demonstrated deposits beneath the glomerular epithelial cells. An antigen was demonstrated in the serum and urine of nephrotic animals. This antigen exibited immunologic identity with host tubular antigen. Arthus and delayed skin reactions were utilized to demonstrate the active role of the humoral system, in contrast to the lack of specific delayed (cellular) mechanisms. This latter observation was confirmed by the lack of specific monolayer destruction by isogeneic nephrotic lymphocytes in vitro, and by the positive cell transfer of sensitized lymphocytes into isogeneic kidneys.</description><creator>Mandl, Michael A.</creator><contributor>Watson, J.

Hitherto only those species of insects numerous enough to impair the health or efficiency of the trees and their products have been considered of sufficient economic importance to be worthy of extensive study. Now, insects capable of being vectors of virus diseases may assume a significance quite out of proportion to their relative density of population. It was therefore decided to commence a study from this point of view of the insects inhabiting the cherry orchards of the Niagara District of Ontario. The leaf hoppers were chosen as the first group to be investigated as it is in this family that vectors of many other important plant virus diseases are found.

This author’s hope is to make clear what prob-[sic] were common to both nobility and Crown, how they were met by both, and finally, why it was that the Crown emerged victorious from the struggle. 1594 was chosen as the starting date because it is the year in which Henry IV was finally recognized as king; the closing date, 1624, marks the entrance of Richelieu into Louis XIII’s council. Some mention is made, however, of events occuring after 1624, which indicate a strengthening of the Crown’s position. This effort is, at best, but an introction [sic] to the question. Much of the necessary material - histories of the various provinces, the “proces- verbaux” of the provincial estates, the Parlements, the Huguenots’ assemblies, collections of letters of the various nobles - in short, some of the most valuable sources for this period were not available. With the information at my disposal, however, I hope to have written something which will prove helpful, and perhaps even interesting to other students of this period.

The yellow colouring matter, citrinin, produced by several species or fungi, exerts considerable antibiotic activity against most gram-positive and some gram-negative organisms in vitro. Although some uncertainty existed as to its usefulness in vivo, the high yield and ease of production justified further investigation of this antibiotic. The purpose or this investigation was to study the chemistry of citrinin in order to elucidate its structure more fully with the object or relating its antibacterial activity to specific functional groups. At the same time derivatives were to be prepared to obtain compounds that would be more active than citrinin in vivo and also be more acceptable with regard to toxicity, stability, solubility and colour. The above objects, as far as they lay within the scope of this investigation, have been accomplished. [...]</description><creator>Pringle, Ross Barton.</creator><contributor>McFarlane, W.

This deficit will most certainly affect Canada’s overall supply in 1947, particularly as our production has declined, eg., the amount of lard produced in 1946 was only fifty percent of the 1944 production. [...] Linseed oil comprises by far the largest proportion of the vegetable oil produced in Canada and if it could be utilized for edible purposes it would assist materially in alleviating prevailing shortages of food oils. Some linseed oil is being used in the manufacture of shortening but the amount has to be strictly limited because of the undesirable flavour and odour its products acquire in baking. The problem of “flavour reversion” in linseed shortenings has recieved considerable attention in recent years and improved products have been obtained, but the undesirable flavours and odours have never been completely eliminated. There is considerable evidence that linolenic acid is the main source of the trouble. Linolenic acid is known to be more susceptible to the action of heat than the other component acids of linseed oil. The ensuing investigation, therefore, is primarily concerned with a study of the nature of heat polymerization with the object of establishing the conditions of thermal treatment of the oil which would eliminate “flavour reversion” in the final shortening.

Fertilization resulted in a considerable increase in the percent phosphorous in the fertilized forage over that in the unfertilized but this increased forage phosphorous was not fully available to the animals. The indications were that this was a direct result of the increased physiological age and resultant lower digestibility of the fertilized forage. This was borne out by the fact that the forage phosphorous in the hay cut at the pre-bloom stage, which had a higher digestibility, was more available to the animals than that cut at the more mature stage of growth.</description><creator>Proctor, William Clark.</creator><contributor>Crampton, E.
