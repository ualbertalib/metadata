In constructing a probability model for an experiment, the first step is a consideration of what are the possible outcomes of the experiment. We assume that all possibilities for the outcomes can be foreseen, and we refer to this collection of outcomes as the sample space H. An arbitrary outcome or point of this space is designated by x. The events to be studied are aggregates of such outcomes, they are represented by subsets of H which belong to the σ-algebra A.</description><creator>Tracey, Sister.

Although the liver probably plays an important role in this regard, the importance of extrahepatic tissues in steroid metabolism is becoming increasingly apparent. In 1948 Werthessen and collaborators (1, 2, 3) reported that incubation of estrone in blood resulted in destruction of the 17-keto function of the steroid accompanied by a loss of biological activity. On the other hand, Bischoff and associates (4, 5) incubated the red cells of rabbit or man with estrone and observed a marked increase in the biological activity of the added steroid. The discrepancy in the two sets of data was ascribed at the time to differences either in assay techniques or in experimental conditions.</description><creator>Trachewsky, Daniel.</creator><contributor>Hobkirk, R.

The main part of the thesis is Chapter IV, which is concerned with an analysis of the meteorological data. The final chapter offers some suggestions as to the use of the data in the field of applied climatology.

It deals with the taxonomy of the trematodes and with some of the relationships between the host and the parasite. Lake Hertel is situated at an elevation of 570 feet on Mont St. Hilaire one of the Monteregion Hills in the St. Lawrence Lowlands. The lake measures about 2,000 feet in length and in width. It has a surface area of between 75 and 80 acres and a maximum depth of between 24 and 30 feet depending on the season of the year. The shoreline is regular and most of the bottom is of a fine dark mud. There is little variety in the type of habitats available to the various species of fish and their parasites.</description><creator>Todd, John. H.</creator><contributor>Cameron, T.

Although nematodes, as parasites of vertebrates and plants, have been recognized as significant factors in reducing agricultural production, they are themselves victims of a number of parasitic organisms. Struggle for existence is universal among living organisms regardless of their biological level, and this competitive relationship between nematodes and other organisms in their environments is by no means unique.

This serum component is termed antibody and the material which stimulated its production is called antigen. The animal which has formed antibodies is said (by convention) to be immunized. The presence of antibodies in the serum of immunized animals may be recognized by the occurrence of certain characteristic reactions such as precipitation, agglutination, and complement fixation.</description><creator>Tenenhouse, Harriet.

It is part of a general investigation which aims to identify and evaluate factors affecting medical school performance with the ultimate goal of predicting academic standing in medical school applicants. In reviewing the major contributions in this field, Gottheil and Michael (1957) report that premedical grades, and, to a lesser extent, intelligence and aptitude, are associated with medical school achievement. Schwartzman, Hunter, and Prince (1961) have shown, however, that first year medical students who differed significantly in academic rank were similar in intelligence and aptitude. In a subsequent study, Schwartzman, Hunter, and Lohrenz (1962) have also found that the relation between achievement and aptitude progressively decreases from the second to the fourth years of medical training.</description><creator>Taylor, Nancy.

This has been especially true since the Second World War, when there was a great demand for dry milk products of high stability and good dispersibility. The process of "instantization" has made possible the production of spray dried skim milk powders which are readily dispersible in cold water. However, little progress has been made towards the production of a readily dispersible whole milk powder.

Prior to the Union and even well into the eighteenth century Scotland remained very poor. This state of poverty to a greater or lesser degree was common to all. If the farmer, the artisan, cottager and labourer suffered poverty the gentry experienced acute and chronic lack of money. In this predominantly agricultural country both the lowly and the high-born concentrated most of their energies to eke out from the land as best an existence as possible.</description><creator>Straka, Waclaw.

Critics have deplored the high rate of reading failure among high school students. Others claim that there is a lack of interest among adults and youths in good books. It has been alleged that reading materials lack interesting content, have been over-simplified, and are unduly repetitious. A more insistent criticism has been that reading problems and failures can be attributed to the lack of phonetic training in reading instruction. The controversy over the methods of teaching reading probably reached its peak in 1955. It was at that time, that Rudolph Flesch’s articles, entitled, "Why Johnny Can’t Read”, were syndicated in 120 American newspapers.</description><creator>Stinson, Franga, B.</creator><contributor>Hall, C.

Four types of insect viruses are recognized and these are: the nuclear polyhedroses (Borrelinavirus), the cytoplasmic polyhedroses (Smithiavirus), the granuloses (Bergoldiavirus), and non-inclusion viruses (Moratorvirus). Nuclear polyhedrosis viruses are rod-shaped, about 200 to 400 mμ in length and 20 to 70 mμ in diameter (Bergold, 1958). The virus particles are occluded by protein that crystallizes to form the polyhedral inclusion bodies which may range in size from 1.0μ to 10.0μ. Particles and inclusion bodies are formed in the nuclei of susceptible cells.</description><creator>Stairs, Gordon. R.</creator><contributor>McFarlane, J.

Since then a great deal of research has been done on this distribution and the distributions stemming from it. It enjoys remarkable application in medecine, psychology, genetics, biology, physics, economics and other areas. This work is an attempt to present, in an organized manner, the existing knowledge of the Poisson distribution, and so, is basicly expository in nature, and definitely not original. Complete references are given throughout. The Poisson distribution and four generalized Poisson distributions are first introduced and various properties are developed, properties which are used in the later chapters on estimation and hypothesis testing.</description><creator>Sproule, Raymond.

The beams were subjected to different loading conditions so that various combinations of shear and bending moment existed at the opening. A study of the stress distributions around the openings was made. The results were compared to the theories developed on the basis of the theory of elasticity and on the basis of the simplified method of the Vierendeel Truss solution. Expressions were derived for the stresses. The investigation showed the presence of high stress concentrations at the edge of the large circular opening and the reduction of the yield load capacity in every case examined. There was no reduction in the ultimate load capacity in the beams tested except in the case of pure bending.</description><creator>So, Wai-Cheong.</creator><contributor>Gersovitz, B.

Today, the sugar-cane plant is cultivated in a number of countries in the tropics and subtropics--in many of which, conditions do not appear to be ideal. Because of the increasing demand for this commodity over so long a period and in so many diverse areas, sugar-cane has spread widely with the discovery and settlement of new lands, beginning in the 15th century. Subsequent expansion of European and world trade, vagaries of evolving geopolitics, and later, inter-commodity competition induced under differing political conditions helped to continue the spread of the plant. The sugar-cane which remains a major commercial crop, can benefit from a climatological investigation into its growth requirements, for this, in fact, has been very little investigated during the three hundred years of prominence and dispersal.</description><creator>Smith, Samuel.
