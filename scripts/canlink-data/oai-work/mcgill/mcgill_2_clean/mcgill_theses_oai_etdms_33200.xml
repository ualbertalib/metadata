The thesis provides a review of the existing contributions made to the subject, identifying those areas that can be advanced in depth or breadth and making theoretical contributions to some of these areas. The design, manufacturing and commissioning of a full-scale representative example of a redundant manipulator designed for kinematic isotropy is also discussed. Although various theoretical methods of analysis and characterization of the kinematic performance have been reported in the past two decades, the kinematic architecture of industrial manipulators has not changed very much. The design requirements for these manipulators, have been mostly driven by issues such as kinematic simplicity and mechanical constructibility. These criteria have thus led to the existence of a particular class of manipulators whose axes are either parallel or perpendicular, i.e., orthogonal manipulators. It is believed that, in order to fully exploit the redundancy of the new generation of industrial manipulators, it is advantageous to consider general architectures. If improved kinematic performance can be achieved by examining novel manipulator architectures, then it becomes necessary to explore new design requirements. The aim of this thesis is to contribute to the above-mentioned exploration. In Chapter 2, the singularity and workspace of regional structures (i.e., three-axis manipulators) are discussed. Regional structures forming the positioning part of most industrial manipulators, they have been regarded as representatives of nonredundant manipulators. Chapter 3 contains a detailed review of the proposed measures of dexterity together with an extensive discussion on the invariance properties of these indices. Chapter 4 is devoted to the investigation of the condition numbers of matrices in general, and of the Jacobian matrix of the robotic manipulators in particular. In Chapter 5, the isotropic design of redundant manipulators is discussed in detail whereby several isotropic seven-axis designs are introduced. Anthropomorphic requirements are also included where, it is shown that seven- and eight-axis manipulators cannot possess isotropy and anthropomorphism simultaneously. Optimum postures of hyperredundant manipulators are then investigated and finally, singularity distributions in the workspace of isotropic manipulators are compared to those of their nonisotropic counterparts. In Chapter 6, kinematic performance of serial manipulators is discussed from a geometric point of view. A novel measure of conditioning based on an index of isotropy, defined elsewhere, is examined in detail, and several interesting features of this measure are provided. With the aid of this measure, explicit expressions for the determination of the characteristic length, and the characteristic point are derived. In Chapter 7, the kinematic and mechanical design of a full-scale seven-axis isotropic manipulator called REDIESTRO 1 are introduced. REDIESTRO 1 was designed, manufactured and commissioned during the course of this thesis at the McGill Centre for Intelligent Machines (CIM) of McGill University.</description><creator>Ranjbaran, Farzam.</creator><contributor>Angeles, Jorge (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>A methodology for the kinematic design and performance evaluation of serial manipulators /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q811km43z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8p58pf71c</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:dr26z0187</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:37:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The injection molding process, due to its versatility, cost effectiveness, and ability to produce precise complex articles is widely used in plastics processing. Mold cavity pressure is a good indicator of the processes taking place in the cavity and plays an important role in determining the quality of the molded articles. The dynamic modeling and control of cavity pressure, based on a physically-based approach, is studied in this research project. The work deals with the filling and packing phases. A lumped physically-based model was developed in order to study the behavior of the system. The model is derived from conservation laws and incorporates a physical understanding of the process. The whole system was divided into subsystems including the hydraulic system, ram-screw, barrel, and polymer delivery system. It was found necessary to account for polymer melt elasticity as well as non-Newtonian behavior of the polymer melt flow. Consideration of the growing solid skin in the polymer delivery system was found to be necessary. The dynamics of the cavity pressure during the filling phase were investigated and found to be non-linear and time-varying in relation to the hydraulic servo-valve opening which is the manipulated variable. The dynamic behavior of the cavity pressure is approximated by piece-wise linearization of the non-linear governing equations to derive a transfer function using the physically-based model which is of fifth order. Adaptive PI, PID, and IMC controllers were designed and tested for the control of the cavity pressure. Various tuning techniques, along with changes in set-point, were used to determine conservative settings for the PI and PID controllers. A similar approach was used to study the dynamics of the cavity pressure during the packing phase. A sixth order transfer function, with piece-wise linearization, was derived to approximate the non-linear and time-varying behavior of the cavity pressure during packing. The adaptive PI, PID, and IMC controllers were successfully applied into the packing phase. The transition of the filling-to-packing was selected to be detected by the derivative of the cavity pressure and adaptive controllers were successfully used for this phase. Two commonly used injection molding grade thermoplastics, polyethylene and polystyrene, were used in experimental part of this work for model validation and controller testing.</description><creator>Rafizadeh, Mehdi.</creator><date>1996</date><subject>Plastics Technology.</subject><title>Physically-based dynamic model for the control of cavity pressure in thermoplastics injection molding</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2v23vv96q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dr26z0187</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hq37vq28k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:37:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A common problem in medical research is the estimation of the prevalence of a disease in a given population. This is usually accomplished by applying a diagnostic test to a sample of subjects from the target population. In this thesis, we investigate the sample size requirements for the accurate estimation of disease prevalence for such experiments. When a gold standard diagnostic test is available, estimating the prevalence of a disease can be viewed as a problem in estimating a binomial proportion. In this case, we discuss some anomalies in the classical sample size criteria for binomial parameter estimation. These are especially important with small sample sizes. When a gold standard test is not available, one must take into account misclassification errors in order to avoid misleading results. When the sensitivity and the specificity of the diagnostic test are both known, a new adjustment to the maximum likelihood estimator of the prevalence is suggested, and confidence intervals and sample size estimates that arise from this estimator are given. A Bayesian approach is taken when the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test are not exactly known. Here, a method to determine the sample size needed to satisfy a Bayesian sample size criterion that averages over the preposterior marginal distribution of the data is provided. Exact methods are given in some cases, and a sampling importance resampling algorithm is used for more complex situations. A main conclusion is that the degree to which the properties of a diagnostic test are known can have a very large effect on the sample size requirements.</description><creator>Rahme, Elham H.</creator><contributor>Joseph, Lawrence (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Biology, Biostatistics.</subject><title>Sample size determination for prevalence estimation in the absence of a gold standard diagnostic test</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d504rn087.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hq37vq28k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k930c0037</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:37:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>On 1 October 1879 the German Imperial Court, the Reichsgericht, was formally opened in a ceremony in Leipzig. Decades of division among the German states, particularly in the years between the end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 and the creation of the German Reich in 1871, led to constant demands for national unification on political, economic, social and legal levels. Throughout those years proposals for Rechtseinheit, or legal unity, called for numerous substantive reforms as well as procedural or institutional reforms. Such proposals ultimately led to several important legal reforms, including the adoption of the Imperial Justice Laws of 1877. This dissertation argues that the successful establishment of the Reichsgericht, as an integral component of the larger movement towards German legal unity, provides an important example of contemporary struggles between centralization and particularism and between liberal political ideals and political realities in the new German Reich. Between 1806 and 1879 several contemporaries recommended the creation of a national supreme court for the German states. The failure of the pre-1867 court proposals contrasted sharply with the successful proposals of the 1867 to 1879 period. Nevertheless, the negotiations and debates which took place between the various German states, between the federal government and the states, and in the legislative organs of the German state itself, were intense and contentious. The creation of the Reichsgericht reflected several important issues, including the comparative abilities of the various states, the federal bureaucracy and the federal legislature to influence the form and substance of national judicial legislation. The documentary evidence for this dissertation has been gathered from several archival depositories, including relevant holdings in the Bundesarchiv sections in Potsdam and Dahlwitz-Hoppegarten and the Prussian state archives in Berlin-Dahlem, and from published government and contemporary sources. In addition, unpublished and published secondary sources have been utilized.</description><creator>Reynolds, Kenneth W.</creator><contributor>Hoffmann, P. C.

A prohibitively large deposition of energy is required for direct initiation of higher-hydrocarbon fuels in air. Consequently, methods are being sought to reduce the run-up distance required for DDT. It has been proposed that the addition of a very sensitive fuel, or of nitrate-based sensitizers typically used in diesel fuels, could increase the sensitivity of hydrocarbon fuel-air mixtures by increasing the chemical kinetic rates. Studies have indicated that the effect of nitrates on diesel fuels occurs through the action of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) abstracted from the nitrate molecule. Experiments were therefore carried out in order to evaluate the effect of acetylene (C2H2) and NO2 addition to propane (C3H8)---oxygen (O2)---nitrogen (N 2) mixtures at ambient conditions. The run-up distance for mixtures of C3H8/C2H2-O2-N 2 was first investigated for varying proportions of C3H 8 and C2H2 in the fuel. Then, the run-up distance and detonation cell size were established for C3H8-O 2-N2 mixtures without NO2 and with NO2 added as a 10% to 50% fuel additive. The results show that the effect of C 2H2 is a very gradual reduction in run-up distance with increasing C2H2 concentration, making it an ineffective additive. The addition of NO2 causes no change in either the run-up distance or the cell width, indicating that the kinetic changes brought about by the NO2 are not significant to the initiation of detonation. This result is shown to agree with kinetic models that suggest that NO2 is not very effective at promoting ignition at very high temperatures such as that characteristic of detonations.</description><creator>Pinard, Pierre Francois.</creator><contributor>Higgins, Andrew J.

The installation requirements for these types of systems are such that manual tuning of the antenna is impracticable. The antenna impedance may not match that of the cable and radio receiver, resulting in electrical reflections in the cable. These reflections create intersymbol interference (ISI), which distorts the received signal and limits the performance of the communication link. It is shown that this distortion can be modelled using only four parameters: the transit time, the amplitude and the angle of the reflection coefficient and the synchronization offset. A joint maximum likelihood (ML) block estimator for the parameters is presented with the corresponding Cramer-Rao bound. The performance of the estimator is evaluated using simulations and compared to the bound. A more practical iterative estimator algorithm for the joint estimation of the parameters is also suggested. To compensate for the distortion at the receiver, a filter design technique based on the estimated parameters is introduced. The method, obtained from the least squares procedure, produces an approximate inverse filter for the channel, minimizing the distortion at the receiver. Results comparing the proposed method to traditional adaptive equalizers are presented. They show that the minimum mean squared error (MSE) achieved by the proposed method approaches the power of the noise, the minimum value attainable.</description><creator>Pelletier, Benoît, 1977-</creator><contributor>Champagne, B.

The embedded memory is one of the vital parts of any system-on-chip. Today it is not enough just to design and fabricate the embedded memory. In order to put the System-On-Chip in mass production, the designer has to be concerned about yield and reliability of the embedded memory. This thesis provides background on fault tolerance improvement theory, and gives several new solutions on how to improve reliability and enhance yield of the embedded memory in efficient ways. A complete fast embedded SRAM and Control Block for Programmable Clock Manager have been designed, implemented, integrated into a System-On-Chip and tested. The thesis incorporates two novel circuits that significantly improve embedded memory yield and reliability. This thesis describes new embedded memory architecture for enhanced yield, performance and power consumption. The architecture is able to tolerate major defects including memory kill defects. The mathematical model of the new architecture is presented as well and shows the advantages of new architecture. The new induced Error-Correcting Code (ECC) for Multilevel Dynamic Random Access Memory (MLDRAM) is introduced. The ECC is able to correct 2-bit error and detect 4-bit error. The new ECC also improves reliability and power consumption of the embedded MLDRAM.</description><creator>Polianskikh, Boris.</creator><contributor>Zilic, Zeljko (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Fault tolerance and yield improvement of embedded memories</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p8418p964.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z029p649j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zk51vj51w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:37:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A thickener is a continuous gravity separation device that reduces or removes suspended solid particles from liquor. Clarified liquor is removed from the top and thickened solids are discharged from the bottom. Thickeners are an essential part of plant water management. A conductivity-based sensor has been developed for use in a thickener and has been successfully tested in industrial applications. Data from at Falconbridge's Kidd Creek operations, Inco's Thompson and, in particular, Inco's Sudbury operations are discussed. The probe designed for this work is a multi-cell arrangement that exploits the difference in conductivity between the liquor and the slurry. Conductivity measurements are taken as a function of depth to provide a profile of the solids content of the thickener. Conductivity measurements can be converted to solids concentration (percent solids) using a model developed by Maxwell. The resulting solids concentration versus depth profile was used to interrogate the behaviour of the solids and to develop thickener control signals.

As system complexity increases, interconnect becomes the dominant factor over transistor sizes in determining the overall performance. Theoretically, systems-on-a-chip implementations eliminate most packaging interfaces to improve the system-level performance. Manufacturing cost is also reduced by integrating both analog and digital circuits using monolithic CMOS technologies. Unfortunately, substrate coupling is found to be a major obstacle for the advancement of system-on-a-chip. Accurate predictions of substrate coupling in large-scale systems demand a modeling algorithm with high speed and high resolution, which are difficult to achieve simultaneously. This thesis provides a comprehensive approach towards predicting and preventing substrate noise coupling issues in large systems efficiently. We are primarily interested in modeling the epitaxial-type heavily-doped bulk substrate, that is commonly used in system-on-a-chip designs. An efficient substrate parasitics extraction algorithm based on Delaunay triangulation is proposed. It is optimized for large-scale design applications. Active noise suppression circuits that improve guard band noise insulation efficiency are also developed. SPICE simulation results of circuit layouts comprising the proposed substrate model are compared against those with substrate models generated from Cadence AssuraRTM Substrate Coupling Analysis tool. Various experiments are performed to obtain fabrication-related substrate parameters, measure the circuit performance and validate the modeling results.</description><creator>Chan, Henry H.Y., 1977-</creator><contributor>Zilic, Zeljko (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Substrate coupling analysis and noise reduction methods</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pk02cc67p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k643b2858</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4t64gq06c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:37:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>An analysis and comprehensive solution to the direct kinematics problem (DK) of all planar 3-legged platforms with lower pairs, called general planar Stewart-Gough platform (PSGP), is presented. There are 10 types of PSGP DK problem formulation including those with mixed leg architecture. Planar kinematic mapping expresses pole position and rotation angle of a planar displacement as a point in 3-dimensional projective space represented by 4 homogeneous coordinates. This provides a universal tool for kinematic analysis. Its application will be demonstrated in the derivation of a general algorithm for planar DK. For each type of PSGP, the problem is reduced to a 6th order univariate polynomial whose roots reveal all solutions. An example of a PSGP with 6 real assembly configurations is presented. Furthermore, this algorithm was implemented and tested exhaustively. A complete self-contained version, coded in C, is available at http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~paul/.

Mixtures of hydrogen, ethylene, propane, and methane with air at ambient conditions over a range of equivalence ratios are used. In contrast to the previous results obtained in circular cross-sectioned tubes, it is found that only the quasi-detonation regime and the slow turbulent deflagration regimes are observed for ethylene-air and for propane-air. The transition from the quasi-detonation regime to the slow turbulent deflagration regime occurs at D/lambda ≈ 1 (where D is the tube "diameter" and lambda is the detonation cell size). When D/lambda &gt;&gt; 1, the quasi-detonation velocities that are observed are similar to those in unobstructed smooth tubes. For hydrogen-air mixtures, it is found that there is a gradual transition from the quasi-detonation regime to the high speed turbulent deflagration regime.

Solid and liquid alkanes or fatty acids were used as lipophilic substrates in shake flask experiments. With a few of these substrates, there was a significant amount of direct incorporation into the sophorolipid products. Of all substrates tested, only hexadecane and heptadecane resulted in the exclusive production of crystalline, diacetylated lactone sophorolipids that contained a single type of hydroxy fatty acid. It was determined that the presence of a single type of sophorolipid structure was necessary to obtain crystalline products. It was also possible to obtain the crystalline product using larger scale experiments with hexadecane. The direct incorporation of hexadecane was shown to result in increased sophorolipid production efficiency with hexadecane being used as the sole source of the hydroxy fatty acids needed for sophorolipid production and the hydrophilic substrate being used as a source of energy. With the other lipophilic substrates, this efficiency was lost because there was appreciable de novo synthesis of the fatty acids.</description><creator>Cavalero, David A.</creator><contributor>Cooper, D.

However, such schools are also very complex to develop and difficult to maintain and operate. Within Canada though, there are many examples of successful outdoor school operations, three of which are considered here: the North Vancouver Outdoor School, the Olympic Park Institute and the Golden Ears Learning Centre. From these case studies lessons can be learned regarding issues such as: land tenureship, program design, staffing options, administrative systems, facility requirements, finance options and abilities to attract students. The discussion of these factors can then be applied to the development of a nation wide network of residential outdoor schools within the framework of Canadian Biosphere Reserves. Currently there are ten Biosphere Reserves in Canada which, when analyzed, prove to be very adequate sites for environmental education from both physical and social stand points. The Canadian Biosphere Reserve Association is the coordinating body which fosters communication and cooperation between individual Reserves. If a network of residential outdoor schools were to be developed within this association framework, it would serve, both to fulfill the Canadian Biosphere Reserve Associations mandate to support environmental education and would help partially alleviate the lack of adequate environmental education facilities in Canada today.</description><creator>Webbe, Jaime Alexandra.</creator><contributor>Meredith, Thom (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Open-air schools -- Canada.</subject><subject>Canadian Biosphere Reserves Association.</subject><subject>National environmental study areas -- Canada.</subject><subject>Environmental education -- Canada.</subject><subject>Canada Man and the Biosphere Program.</subject><subject>Biosphere reserves -- Canada.</subject><title>An analysis of the feasibility of developing a network of residential outdoor schools within the Canadian Biosphere Reserve Association /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7w62fb075.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f1881n80g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pr76f530r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:37:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis examines the identity of the students at the Montreal Hoshuko and the factors that affect the way in which they identify themselves as Japanese, drawing upon a framework of political economy and concepts of globalization and transnationalism. It also explores how Japanese identity is changing in this globalized world. The fieldwork demonstrates that the identity of the Hoshuko students is somewhat commoditized based on Japanese popular culture such as Pokemon. It suggests that increasing communication and contact with external forces has changed and will further change the way Japanese people understand their own culture, identity, and themselves. It is argued that identities are not fixed or frozen in time; rather, they should be understood as flexible and a process shaped by history, a given context, and multiple external factors, and that a more fluid understanding of Japanese culture and identity is needed in a globalized, transnationalized world.</description><creator>Yoshida, Reiko.</creator><contributor>Attwood, Donald (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Education -- Japan</subject><subject>Japanese -- Canada -- Psychology</subject><subject>National characteristics, Japanese</subject><subject>Education -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</subject><title>Political economy, transnationalism, and identity : students at the Montreal Hoshuko</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6t053h86r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pr76f530r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anthropology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vt150k87p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:37:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis was to examine the interaction of players' skill level, body strength, and various types of stick construction and stiffness on the performance of the hockey shots. Forty subjects were tested, and each subject performed the slap and wrist shots with different stick shaft constructions and stiffness. Shot mechanics were evaluated by simultaneously recording of ground reaction forces, stick movements and peak puck velocity. Data analyzed with a 4-way ANOVA for several dependent variables. The results indicated that: (1) the slap shot was faster than the wrist shot corresponding to greater vertical force, stick bending and hand placement; (2) the puck velocity was influenced by skill level and body strength not stick type; and, (3) the skilled players generated greater vertical force and stick bending by adjusting their hand positions.

In my thesis, through the examination of selected images and writings, I determine how a differentiation between doctrinal and secular spirituality can be established. The importance of a rooted cosmopolitan outlook with respect to cross-cultural artistic manifestations is explored with the aim of synthesizing spiritual elements that transcend all cultures. The political, social and educational implications of ignoring spirituality are examined. A proposal to incorporate spirituality into education is introduced using art as a means to self-knowledge and understanding the implications of interconnectedness.</description><creator>Walsh, Dale.</creator><contributor>White, Boyd (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Education -- Philosophy.</subject><subject>Spirituality in art.</subject><title>Art and secular spirituality</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8623j065w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z9031678</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Culture and Values in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q811km447</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:37:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The socio-political tranquility of Hyderabad-Deccan preceding 1948 facilitated much educational and cultural advancement. This rapidly developing environment provided Hamidullah with the ideal opportunity for educational growth, having earned five degrees related to the field of law by the age of 28 in 1936. He began writing at age 18, and thereafter he dedicated his life to literary pursuits. Today, he has written over 100 books and 900 articles; he speaks over 20 languages and writes in over 10 languages. Along with one of his major areas of focus, Islamic constitutional law, he has written on a variety of other subject areas, ranging from Islamic theology to Islamic history, from Qur'anic exegesis to Orientalism. This thesis attempts to study five books in the field of Islamic constitutional law by Dr. Muhammad Hamidullah in order to provide a sample to judge and analyze his scholarship. Against the background of Hamidullah's historical and political context coupled with his high level of religiosity, the thesis will examine his utilization of the scientific approach throughout his writings. This thesis furthermore looks at the potential reasons he chose the path of study that he did, dedicating his entire life to the literary sphere and to a lesser degree the political sphere. It focuses on Hamidullah's thought and methodology as they emerged from his social and political background and as he expressed them in his literary achievements. This thesis, therefore, sets out to develop a critical analysis of Hamidullah's works, his philosophical perspective, and his contribution to contemporary scholarship. Hamidullah has contributed to Islamic scholarship by making available Islamic literature to mixed audiences since he follows the scientific approach, writes in a variety of languages, and covers a wide range of unique topics. Indeed Dr. Muhammad Hamidullah is a well-esteemed scholar of formidable status and prestige in numerous fields of Islamic history.</description><creator>Mustapha, Nadira.</creator><contributor>Turgay, A.

Five-minute ECG and breathing recordings were obtained at rest at spontaneous breathing (SP) and at paced breathing rates of SP+4 (M4) and SP-4 (P4) breaths/minute. Spectral power components of HRV were computed from the RR interval sequences; amplitude and phase of RSA were computed from the sinusoid fitted to the instantaneous heart rate within each breath. RSA sensitivity was obtained from the slope of the RSA amplitude versus breathing frequency relationship. Four weeks of training caused significantly increased in VO2max (37.3 +/- 4.4 versus 40.0 +/- 5.4 ml/kg/min; (p &lt; 0.01); a significant decrease in DBP (p &lt; 0.001); a slight decrease in SBP (p &lt; 0.08), and max HR slightly decreased (P &lt; 0.06). None of these variables were changed significantly in control subjects. No change in resting HR was found after training (74 +/- 14 versus 74 +/- 7 bpm). Pre versus post-training results in total and high frequency spectral powers (ms2) of HRV taken at SP were as was RSA amplitude. A significant reverse correlation was found between RSA-amplitude and breathing frequency (r = 0.40). Results suggest a trend towards an increased gain in the amplitude of RSA for varying breathing frequencies after training. In conclusion, four weeks of intensive endurance training may significantly increase maximal aerobic power and provide some health related benefit such as a decrease in diastolic pressure, without concurrent changes in resting heart rate or its modulation by cardiac vagal activity.</description><creator>Ofir, Dror.</creator><contributor>Turcotte, Rene (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Perrault, Helene (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Heart beat.</subject><subject>Respiration.</subject><subject>Physical education and training -- Physiological aspects.</subject><title>Time course of adaptation in heart rate variability and respiratory sinus arrhythmia to intensive endurance training</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7w62fb08f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nz806166r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p8418p97d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:37:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The current state of preimplantation genetic diagnosis technology is presented, as are the biological principles and medical procedures that make it possible. The arguments of both proponents and those with social and ethical reservations about the broader implications of the technique are carefully reviewed, and the limitations of the dominant medical model approach to the technique are exposed. A discussion of reproductive autonomy in light of emerging testing applications of PGD not directly related to the avoidance of serious genetic abnormalities in the resulting child demonstrates the complexity of both clinical decision-making and public policy formulation with regard to PGD. Recently proposed legislation in Canada reflects such complexities, and highlights the lack of social consensus on the appropriate uses of, and restrictions on, PGD. A variety of "soft law" instruments, notably professional codes of practice and research guidelines implemented by institutional ethics committees, may mitigate some of the uncertainty surrounding PGD in Canada, but their limited applicability and espousal of the medical model approach render questionable their capacity to reconcile tolerance of pluralism with respect for human life, diversity, and reproductive autonomy.</description><creator>McDougall, Christopher W.</creator><contributor>Manfredi, Christopher (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Prenatal diagnosis -- Canada.</subject><subject>Prenatal diagnosis -- Moral and ethical aspects -- Canada.</subject><title>Uncertain risks, responsibilities &amp; regulations : the ethics &amp; control of PGD in Canada</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nk322g115.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p8418p97d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ff3656997</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:37:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Since the end of the Cold War, considerable attention has been paid to "ethnic" or "identitive" conflicts. Some scholars argue that these conflicts tend to draw in 'kin' states who support the belligerent(s) with whom they share identitive affinities. This thesis examines such involvement, based on identitive affinities, in ethnopolitical conflicts. In particular, it analyses the pattern of involvement of one country: Iran. Specifically, it looks at Iran's policy towards five conflicts: Afghanistan, Nagorno-Karabakh, Iraq, South Lebanon and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This thesis argues that kinship is only a permissive cause of involvement while the presence and scope of involvement are determined by other factors, in the following order: security threats, non-security interests (influence, economic interests), and ideology. Proximity is of great importance as security threats usually emanate from neighbours and not from far-away enemies.</description><creator>Pagé, Charles, 1978-</creator><contributor>Noble, Paul (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Iran -- Foreign relations.</subject><subject>Ethnicity.</subject><subject>Political sociology.</subject><title>Involvement based on identitive affinities : the case of Iran</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nv935473x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ff3656997</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6969z2661</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:37:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Although civil war affects all civilians, it impacts men and women in different ways, and it influences their gender roles and responsibilities. Comparatively little attention has been given to assessing the gender sensitivity of international organizations who implement post-conflict reconstruction programs. The different social, economic and political dimensions of war to peace transitions, and how they impact on gender relations, can shed some light on the complicated intersections of needs and interests in wartorn societies. An examination of the policies of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the World Bank reveals that there is relatively little gender mainstreaming within their post-conflict operations. This research finds that the lack of resources and coordination, the failure to build on local capacities, and a lack of commitment to gender mainstreaming are the main obstacles these organizations face. To improve the situation it is recommended that organizations develop and use a 'gender checklist' at all stages of project planning, implementation and monitoring to ensure increased gender sensitivity in post-conflict programming.</description><creator>Barnes, Karen, 1977-</creator><contributor>Brynen, Rex (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Sex role.</subject><subject>Women and war.</subject><subject>Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</subject><subject>Women and peace.</subject><subject>World Bank.</subject><subject>Women -- Social conditions.</subject><subject>Economic assistance -- Evaluation.</subject><title>Through a gendered lens? : institutional approaches to gender mainstreaming in post-conflict reconstruction</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9g54xk36w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6969z2661</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q811km46s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:37:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study was conducted using the Leadership Scale for Sports research instrument on 61 high school, 62 CEGEP, 86 university, and 34 professional football players to determine if these players' preferences for five leadership behaviours differed with respect to level of play, unit of play (offensive and defensive), and team success.

His main sources are the Volsungensaga, the Thidreksaga and the Nibelungenlied. Certain portions of the Ring follow closely the events described in some of the sagas, other portions have been changed and elaborated to achieve theatrical effect. I have endeavoured to explain the differences between the sources and the finished masterpiece. Whether his version of the tales was to ensure good theatre or whether he felt that he was improving on the originals is a moot point. The similarities are sufficient to prove that he had totally immersed himself in the literature available and no doubt felt himself to be a worthy protagonist of this culture. There is no doubt that his music is a masterpiece which may be enjoyed with or without any depth of knowledge of its origins.</description><creator>Berger, Emile.</creator><contributor>Richter, Horst (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Wagner, Richard, 1813-1883.

H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover and Radclyffe Hall's The Well of Loneliness as it relates to the social, linguistic and political elements of literary modernism. Both novels "think sex," allowing specific concepts of sex to act as methods of communication between artists and readers. By writing sex, Hall and Lawrence address the modern reader, providing a script for ideal readerly and writerly approaches to the novel. The first chapter examines contemporary cultural and gender theory's understanding of the relationship between sex and discourse and relates this to political and literary considerations of modernism. The second chapter looks at psychosexual medical texts that influenced modernism's understanding of sex and art; the final chapter examines "thinking sex" in Lady Chatterley's Lover and The Well of Loneliness by examining the content and reception of both works.</description><creator>Balzer, David.</creator><contributor>Hickman, Miranda (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Hall, Radclyffe.

According to a composite index of malnutrition, 19% of them were found malnourished whereas the Mini-Nutritional Assessment, a validated nutritional screening tool, found that 56% of the elderly were malnourished or at risk for malnutrition. Malnourished persons, as determined by the composite index, had a lower lean body mass (LBM) by bioelectrical impedance analysis compared with the well-nourished group (40.5 +/- 9.7 vs. 42.0 +/- 8.7 kg, p = 0.0001). LBM correlated significantly with handgrip strength (r = 0.34, p = 0.0001) but not with gait speed (r = 0.04, p = 0.27). There were no significant differences between nutritional states for any of the two tests of physical function. The score of the MNA, correlated with gait speed (r = 0.24, p = 0.02) but the performance at the physical tests was not different according to the nutritional status defined by this tool. We conclude that malnutrition is relatively prevalent among frail persons participating in the Geriatric Day Hospital and that malnutrition is one among many other factors that contribute to their low level of physical performance. As such, a nutritional intervention may be of benefit in improving the physical function of frail elderly persons who are malnourished.</description><creator>Subki, Manal.</creator><contributor>Morais, Jose A.
