A quantitative carbon-13 NMR spectrum of PVC in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane-d$ sb2$ (TCE-d$ sb2$) was recorded. Theoretical predictions using Bernoullian statistics permitted the reassignment of several resonances. Carbon-13 spin-lattice relaxation times and NOE values were measured as a function of temperature at two magnetic fields for PVC in two solvents, di-butyl phthalate (DBP) and TCE-d$ sb2$. The difference found in the simulation parameters, from the Dejean-Laupretre-Monnerie model, for PVC in the two solvents were rationalized by assuming a specific interaction between DBP and the CHCl group of PVC and to the relative solvent quality. The permeability coefficients, P, of PVC films to oxygen were measured as a function of temperature and plasticizer type and concentration. The plasticizers used were di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DOP), tri-butyl phosphate (TBP), and a binary mixture of the two with a concentration of $ rm Phi sb{DOP}$ = 0.6). The effect of plasticizer type on the permeation coefficients of oxygen followed the trend: P(TBP) $&gt;$ P($ rm Phi sb{DOP}$ = 0.6) $&gt;$ P(DOP). Arrhenius plots of the permeability coefficients showed that the unplasticized and plasticized PVC films of low concentration of plasticizer ($ rm Phi sb{plas} &lt; 0.2$) displayed a discrete change in the slope, in the vicinity of the glass transition temperature, that reflected changes in the activation energy for permeation. In addition, the permeation and diffusion coefficients of oxygen and hydrogen chloride gases in an unplasticized PVC film were measured as a function of temperature. The results suggest that the increase in segmental mobility of the polymer chains above the T$ rm sb{g}$ increases the diffusivity as well as the zone of activation for diffusion leading to the increase in segmental mobility of the polymer chains above the T$ rm sb{g}$ increases the diffusivity as well as the zone of activation for diffusion leading to the increase in both energy and entropy of activation. A computer program has been written which simulates, according to Bernoullian statistics, the relative handedness of successive monomer units during polymerization and calculates the probabilities of configurational sequences before and after a specified degradation mechanism. At levels of degradation that are accessible to experimental verification by solution NMR ($&lt;$2%), the changes in isotacticity that are predicted by these simulations are at (or under) the limits of experimental error. Furthermore, the simulations indicate that for the degradation to result in double bond lengths that correspond to experimentally determined values requires that the dehydrochlorination also include some atactic and syndiotactic sequences which, in turn, reduces the changes in P$ rm sb{mm}$.

A relatively limited complementary experimental investigation was also undertaken to measure vortex-shedding frcquencies for turbulent flows in the ducts of interest. The fluid flows considered in this work are characterized by the Reynolds number, Re, and four geometric parameters: The dimensionless streamwise length and half-thickness of the plates, L/H and $ delta /H$, respectively; the nondimensiond streamwise inter-plate spacing, s/H; and the aspect ratio of the rectangular duct cross-section, b/H. Here, H is the half-height of the ducts. In the numerical investigations, it was assumed that $b/H gg 1$ and the fluid flow is two-dimensional. In the numerical investigation of laminar flows, six different values of the integer periodicity index, m, which refers to the number of geometrically similar modules included in the calculation domain were considered: m = 1, 2 3, 4, 5, and 6. The main findings of this investigation are the following: For $m&gt;1$, multiple stable solutions are possible; the one-module ($m=1$) solution represents one of the possible stable solutions for the multiple-module ($m&gt;1$) calculation domains; the magnitude of the maximum difference between the single- and multiple-module results of the Strouhal number, S, and the time-averaged friction factor, f f, can be as high as 29.2% and 13.9%, respectively; and the critical Reynolds number for the onset of temporally and spatially periodic oscillations increases as the nondimensional plate thickness, $ delta /H$, decreases. It was also found in this investigation that for the thinnest plates considered, $ delta /H$ = 0.12, the numerical solution of the steady-state formulation of the problem provides good estimates of the time-averaged friction factor, f f, and the average nondimensional viscous shear stress, $ tau sbsp{w}{*}$, on the top and bottom surfaces of the plates. However, for $ delta /H$ = 0.20 and 0.32, the unsteady simulations are necessary to obtain accurate values of ff and $ overline{ tau sp{*}} sb{w}$. It was concluded that at present, a combination of complementary experimental and numerical investigations with fine-tuning of some of the closure coefficients in relatively simple turbulence models such as low-Reynolds number two-equation eddy-viscosity models, may be the most effective approach to the prediction of temporally and spatially periodic, fully-developed turbulent flows in interrupted-surface geometries.

A "pseudo-micelle" model has been proposed. The aggregation of pseudo-micelles on the forming polymer chains is believed to be the key step in the stabilization process. Only when the aggregation is possible and fast enough to follow the polymer formation, will the polymer be stabilized. Colloidal polypyrrole and polyaniline were prepared in the presence of the sodium salt of poly(styrene sulfonate). The polymerization is believed to follow a template-guided fashion in which poly(styrene sulfonate) functions as a molecular template for pyrrole and aniline polymerization. The stability and water solubility of the colloids are attributed to the presence of excess poly(styrene sulfonate) sulfonate groups in the resulting complexes. It was found that the chemical polymerization of pyrrole is catalyzed by anionic surfactants and polyelectrolytes. The catalysis is believed to arise from the accumulation of protons, neutral pyrrole monomer and oligomers, and their radical cations in the micellar or polyelectrolyte pseudophase via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Nucleation was found to be a necessary and important step in the chemical polymerization of conducting polyaniline and polypyrole. A nucleation process has been proposed. A polyaniline-polypyrrole graft- or block-copolymer was produced by adding colloidal PANI to a similar amount of pyrrole. Hollow conducting polypyrrole nanoparticles with diameters of ca. 140 nm or 60 nm and wall thicknesses of ca. 10 nm were fabricated. The shape and size of the hollow particles are determined by the core particles and the wall thickness is controlled by reaction conditions. A $ gamma$-Fe$ rm sb2O sb3$-polypyrrole composite possessing both magnetic and electrically conductive properties was also produced. Polypyrrole and polyaniline nanofibers with highly uniform diameters between 10 and 50 nm were fabricated via the templating by lipid microstructures. The hydrophobic edges of the lipid microstructures function as the template. The polymer thickness is readily controlled by the polymerization time. Well-defined conducting polymer nano-rings were also produced. Finally, the sensitivity enhancement of the electroanalysis of halides through the accumulation of trihalides in an overoxidized polypyrrole film was presented. This reveals a new method of using polymer-modified electrodes in electroanalysis, and we term the accumulation of a reaction product "product concentration".</description><creator>Qi, Zhigang</creator><contributor>Lennox, R.

This factor, named seminal plasma motility inhibitor (SPMI), was orignally isolated from seminal plasma and shown to orginate exclusively from the seminal vesicles, where its specific activity is 5- to 10-fold higher than it is in seminal plasma. The present study aimed at investigating the mechanism responsible for this difference in activity. Analysis of semen after ejaculation allowed to demonstrate that this difference in SPMI specific activity is due to the presence of a predominant 52 kDa SPMI precursor form in seminal vesicle fluid which is rapidly degraded after ejaculation by prostatic proteases. In addition, SPMI precursor was found to be associated with semen coagulum proteins and abnormal processing of the precursor in semen was associated with poor sperm motility. A novel method was developed to purify SPMI precursor from seminal vesicle fluid and semen coagulum. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) hydrolyzed SPMI precursor in a manner reminiscent of its processing in whole semen. Biochemical analysis of the precursor protein and its hydrolysis products provided evidence that SPMI precursor is identical to semenogelin, the main structural protein of semen coagulum. The purified precursor inhibited the motility of intact spermatozoa in a reversible and dose-dependent manner. Finally, the characterization of SPMI molecular processing by PSA was addressed. The results directly demonstrate for the first time the restricted chymotrypsin-like specificity of PSA on its major physiological substrate. The sites of hydrolysis by PSA were identified along the precursor molecule and specific domains within the SPMI precursor responsible for biological activity and reactivity with various antibodies were mapped. Overall, these results shed light on the photeolytic precessing of SPMI precursor occurring after ejaculation, and the associated change in SPMI activity on spermatozoa. The present findings provide evidence, for the first time, that a specific protein appears responsible for the observed low sperm motility in freshly ejaculated semen, and that its processing by PSA parallels the progressive increase in sperm motility observed during semen liquefaction.</description><creator>Robert, Martin, 1967-</creator><contributor>Gagnon, Claude (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><title>Purification, characterization, and molecular processing of the precursor of a sperm motility inhibitor present in human seminal plasma</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1v53jz82q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5d86p1939</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Surgical Research</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z603r010t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:45:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The goldfish (Carassius auratus) is a hardy exotic species that have established sporadically distributed feral populations throughout North America. In one shallow seasonally anoxic pond goldfish formed a large stunted population of 15-17,000 ind ha$ sp{-1}$, with 53% being small young of the year. Goldfish were predominantly benthic herbivores with little diet overlap with resident red-spotted newts (Notapthalmus v. viredescens). Thus in relatively simple systems lacking fish predators goldfish can be very successful. However in systems with a complex native fish community, goldfish have had less success in colonizing. This could be related to an inability of goldfish to cope with native predators. Tests for assortative shoaling between brown and gold coloured morphs showed that gold coloured fish exhibited no colour based assortive shoaling, while brown fish showed slight but significant colour preferences for like-coloured fish. This level of shoaling preference did not improve after visual exposure or interaction with native predators, indicating that goldfish showed limited behaviourial responses to predators, and that they were unable to modify their response to a predation threat. Further trials allowing goldfish to interact with either pike (Esox lucius) or bass (Ambloplites rupestris), in both single species groups of predator-naive goldfish, and mixed species conditions of goldfish with predator-experience minnows, showed that goldfish did not alter their behaviour in the presence of minnows (Pimephales notatus) when the predators were not present. However, with the predators present goldfish altered their activities to a more minnow-like pattern and showed a significant improvement in anti-predator behaviour. This improved behaviour continued by goldfish when they were retested on their own, indicating that the goldfish were reacting to the predator and not the minnows. Goldfish colonization may therefore be limited not so much by predation or competition from native cyprinids, but more by the absence/presence of a suitable, native, predator-experienced fish from which to copy the appropriate anti-predator behaviours.</description><creator>Richardson, Michael John</creator><contributor>Whomskey, F.

Consequently, in order to investigate whether dictionary support improves text comprehension, this study compared readers' first-language (L1) and second-language (L2) text comprehension across three dictionary conditions and two proficiency levels. Recall, dictionary usage and reading times were the measures employed. Subjects were anglophone members of the Canadian Armed Forces military personnel with high-intermediate to advanced French second-language skills. Procedural texts were used: subjects read both an L1 and an L2 text in each of three conditions: (a) no dictionary access; (b) access to hard-copy dictionaries; and (c) access to on-line computerized dictionaries. The number of words looked up varied greatly by language, by proficiency level and by dictionary modality, with a far greater number of words accessed in L2 than in L1, by intermediate- than by advanced-level readers and in the on-line rather than in the hard-copy dictionary condition. The variance in dictionary usage was explained by the two-way interactions between language, proficiency level and dictionary condition. Reading times were higher for intermediate-level readers than for advanced-level readers, and when L2 rather than L1 texts were read. These reading time results are consistent with the patterns of dictionary consultation, where intermediate L2 reading produced the most look-ups. Most readers expressed a preference for on-line dictionaries, reporting that the ease of access led to faster and better text comprehension, but this impression was not confirmed by the findings. Analyses of recall protocols indicated that there was no main effect for the type of dictionary consulted. Similar levels of recall were found on all passages read with access to dictionaries, regardless of the language of presentation. Significantly lower recalls were found on passages read with no access to dictionaries, with L2 recall lower than L1 recall. This study indicates that the type of dictionary accessed does not significantly influence comprehension. The high number of L2 dictionary look-ups does suggest that readers may use dictionaries to compensate for weaker second language vocabulary skills, resulting in similar levels of text comprehension across languages.</description><creator>Goyette, Els Spekkens</creator><contributor>Lajoie, Susanne P.

This study examines the issues pertaining to this question through reference to Nancy Fraser and Linda Nicholson, Susan Thistlethwaite, Sheila Davaney, Rebecca Chopp, and Morny Joy. In order to situate this critical question and its implications for feminist theology, the work of the Italian philosopher Gianni Vattimo (1936-$ ...)$ is explored. Vattimo's work is analyzed in relation to three central aspects of his thought: Vattimo's genuine interpretation of the relation of Martin Heidegger to Friedrich Nietzsche, Vattimo's own approach to nihilism, Vattimo's interpretation of Heidegger's notion of ontological difference compared to Jacques Derrida's differance. Questions of gender and of sexual difference are rarely addressed by Vattimo. Vattimo's silence on these questions is queried with the help of the work of Carol Bigwood, a Heideggerean ecofeminist, and through the writings of Derrida on sexual diffcrence. It is argued that Vattimo implicitly understands sexual difference in terms of emancipation emerging today in communication technology and the mass media. The link between sexual difference and technology is related to the work of Donna Haraway to indicate some features of today's feminism with regard to technology. Vattimo's philosophical perspective is related to questions of feminist theology through Heidegger's notion of Verwindung understood by Vattimo as closely related to secularization and the biblical notion of kenosis. This study concludes with an analysis and a critique of the work of Rebecca Chopp, Sallie McFague, and Rosemary Radford Ruether, and it emphasizes the secularizing, kenotic dimension of their thought as the most promising approach to central issues of today's feminism.</description><creator>Frascati, Marta</creator><contributor>Boutin, Maurice (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Feminist theology</subject><subject>Difference (Philosophy)</subject><subject>Nihilism (Philosophy)</subject><subject>Vattimo, Gianni, 1936-</subject><title>The kenosis of feminism : an exploration of Christian feminist theology with special reference to Gianni Vattimo</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8336h343m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wp988m67s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Religious Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:r781wh65m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:45:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The goal of this study is to develop a general theoretical perspective for the archaeological study of intersocietal interaction among hunter-gatherers. Several theoretical frameworks have been offered for the study of interaction, including acculturation, ecological interdependency, peer polity interaction, world-system theory, and a number of more particularist approaches. Although all offer valuable insights, only world-system theory has the potential for application to all types and scales of intersocietal interaction, past and present. The perspective developed here represents an experimental modification of the world-system perspective, with the addition of aspects of previous hunter-gatherer studies, most of which are strongly influenced by cultural ecology. This theoretical perspective is used to develop a model of change in hunter-gatherer world-systems. Particularly important factors in this model are the density and spatio-temporal distribution of subsistence resources, and the availability of "preciosities" (exchanged objects of high value). These factors are hypothesized to affect hunter-gatherer world-systems in terms of three variables: (1) "breadth", the number of interacting regional groups; (2) "depth", the relative importance of the interaction to each regional group; and (3) "internal differentiation", the degree of variability among regional groups within the interacting system. Finally, the model is tested on the archaeological and ethnographic records of the Inuit inhabitants of Herschel Island, northern Yukon Territory, and adjacent regions during the "contact period" of the past 500 years. The test predictions are largely supported by the data, which indicate that the increasing availability of preciosities and the changing distribution of subsistence resources during the contact period caused the indigenous world-system to increase in depth and breadth, and to begin to change in pattern of internal differentiation.</description><creator>Friesen, Trevor Max</creator><contributor>Savelle, James M.

Beginning with the play entitled Les Belles-Soeurs (1968) and up to Marcel poursuivi par les chiens (1992), this thesis presents a threefold analysis of the males in Tremblay's dramatic and romanesque universe. The first part of this thesis focuses on Tremblay's methods of characterization; this provides us with the description of the physical and psychological attributes of the character. This first part also features a chapter describing the physical environment and socio-historical context in which the male character evolves. The second part of this thesis and by far the most important, describes the masculine archetypes in Tremblay's works. Since the male archetypes have so far been set aside in favor of extensive study of the female archetypes, our research in the former seems most appropriate. Finally, the third part presents the symbolic representation of the characters: Is the male, according to Tremblay, the image of a powerless and tortured Quebec, as it has often been claimed? In conclusion, this thesis attempts to show that the males, in Tremblay's works, play an important role despite appearances and statements to the contrary made by the author in the course of many interviews.</description><creator>Gouin, Lorraine</creator><contributor>Smith, Andre (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Tremblay, Michel, 1942- -- Characters -- Men</subject><title>Le personnage masculin dans l'oeuvre de Michel Tremblay</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2v23vv83n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8k71nj75z</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g732db56j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:45:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In aging vertebrates, subpopulations of limbic and periventricular astrocytes accumulate peroxidase-positive cytoplasmic inclusions distinct from lipofuscin. In rodent brain, chronic estrogenization accelerates the appearance of this senescent glial phenotype. Identical inclusions are rapidly induced in primary neuroglial cultures by cysteamine exposure. Abnormal mitochondria replete with redox-active iron and other transition metals are the subcellular precursors of the inclusions in situ and in cysteamine-treated cultures. The objective of this thesis was to elucidate mechanisms responsible for the biogenesis of these glial inclusions in the aging nervous system. We determined that the accumulation of astrocytic inclusions in cysteamine-treated rat glial cultures occurs in the context of an antecedent cellular stress response characterized by (i) the upregulation of heat shock proteins (HSP) 27, 72, 90, ubiquitin and heme oxygenase-1, and (ii) enhanced resistance of cysteamine-stressed astroglia to subsequent oxidative injury. Furthermore, multiple injections of cysteamine or estradiol valerate in adult male rats induced robust overexpression of stress proteins and an accretion of identical peroxidase-positive granules in GFAP-positive astroglia. Both in situ and in cysteamine-treated cultures, HSP27, ubiquitin, glucose-regulated protein 94 and to a lesser extent, HSP72 (but not HSP90 or $ alpha$B-crystallin) exhibited immunolocalization to these astrocytic "stress" inclusions. We observed that exogenous $ rm H sb2O sb2$ induces identical inclusions in cultured astroglia and that cysteamine-derived $ rm H sb2O sb2$ promotes lipid peroxidation in isolated astroglial mitochondria. These data indicate that sustained oxidative stress may represent a "final common pathway" leading to the transformation of normal mitochondria to peroxidase-positive astrocytic inclusions in the aging nervous system. The metal-dependent peroxidase activity of these glial inclusions has been shown to oxidize dopamine and other catechols to neurotoxic free radicals in vitro, implicating these cells in the pathogenesis of parkinsonism and other free radical-related neurodegenerations. Since peroxidase-positive astroglia have been identified in aging human striatum, the findings presented here suggest that antioxidant therapy coupled with pharmacological inhibition of metal sequestration by "stressed" astroglial mitochondria may prove useful in the management of Parkinson's disease and other age-associated neurodegenerative afflictions.</description><creator>Mydlarski, Marc Bernard</creator><date>1995</date><subject>Health Sciences, Human Development.</subject><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>Role of the cellular stress response in the biogenesis of redox-active astrocytic inclusions in the aging nervous system</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6108vd12z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g732db56j</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n870zs39q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:45:34Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation attempts to trace hereditary motifs in the novels of Charles Dickens and to relate these motifs to broader concerns--specifically Dickens's depiction of the formation of the self, his understanding of history and of the role of time Towards this end, I offer an historical overview of scientific and popular thinking on heredity, and suggest how some of these notions were translated into Dickens's fiction. The discussion of hereditary themes in the novels falls into two broad categories--the private and the public. In the first of these, I argue that Dickens tended to define positive moral qualities, such as goodness, as hereditable. At the same time, he was reluctant to portray negative characteristics, such as criminality or insanity as being amenable to hereditary transmission. This assumption of a moral basis to heredity had ramifications for Dickens's understanding of human nature which, in turn spill over into his depiction of the broader public issues associated with heredity--its relationship to class, to race, and to history. The very last section of the thesis focuses on the Darwinian revolution. There I argue that Dickens's attitude towards the importance of hereditary endowment changed after the publication of Darwin's The Origin of Species in 1859. I suggest that Darwin's book prompted Dickens to rethink his earlier deterministic approach to the problem of human identity. After 1859, Dickens jettisons heredity entirely as a factor in the formation of the self and replaces it with environment and experience. The last novels displace the Dickensian metaphors of hidden kinship and universal connection--both of which are related to heredity--and put in their place, the thematics of dispersal and disintegration.</description><creator>Morgentaler, Goldie, 1950-</creator><contributor>Bristol, Michael D.

Firstly, maize grown in short-season areas has lower leaf area indices (LAI) than maize grown in long season areas, due to shorter plant stature and less time for development, which results in reduced leaf number and size. Secondly, in very short-season areas the seasonal thermal-time available may be insufficient to mature grain of current maize hybrids. Therefore development of maize types that accumulate leaf area and mature quickly would increase production of maize in mid- to short-season areas. The leafy (Lfy1) and reduced-stature (rd1) genes make contributions to this end. However, these two genes have not previously been combined. From 1991 to 1993, field experiments were conducted to evaluate the leafy reduced-stature (LRS) inbred lines and hybrids for yield, maturity times and morphological traits, at different planting densities and patterns in Montreal and Ottawa. LRS maize inbred lines showed the most rapid silk extrusion, optimum leaf area development, and rapid growth of the first ear, the highest yield per unit leaf area, and the closest synchronization of pollen shed and silk extrusion at high plant population densities. LRS maize hybrids had the most rapid leaf development, longest grain filling period, lowest grain moisture content at harvest, and highest harvest index. Therefore LRS hybrids should allow an extension into shorter season areas where it can not now be successfully cultivated, and may increase yields in mid- to short season areas where maize is now produced.</description><creator>Modarres Sanavy, S.

Annual turnover of adults and juveniles was very high in both ditch types. The average maximum density of muskrats was the second highest recorded in the literature. Muskrat activity was not predictive of activity of other co-occurring vertebrates. The direct relationship between the logarithm of the number of burrows and the number of muskrats showed the usefulness of this sign of presence as an indicator of population size. Within given ditches, we failed to detect different genetic proximity between adults from successive years between corn and hay ditches. We failed to show that adult genetic proximity within ditches and within years difference between hay and corn ditches. Analyses of adult genetic proximity within and among ditches within a year confirmed the limited dispersal of female muskrat. Muskrat DNA fingerprinting analyses supported the general usefulness of spatiotemporal associations to determine kinship. Habitat use models based on muskrat signs of presence in southern Quebec high clay bank farm ditches showed that muskrat presence was positively associated with water depth, water velocity, and pulpy plant cover (excluding cattail), but was negatively associated with dredging. The type of crop was not important in explaining muskrat presence. In various habitats of the James Bay area, the habitat use models identified a positive relationship with percentages of submerged and floating plant cover, width of the shore herbaceous belt, bank slope and dominance of clay-loam soil on banks. Such models could be used to assess the potential of boreal wetlands to harbour burrow-dwelling muskrats.</description><creator>Nadeau, Simon</creator><contributor>Bider, J. R.

Initially, the confined laminar opposing jet configuration is examined by solving the unsteady and steady conservation equations. Both equal and unequal momentum jets impinging normally against each other are considered. The thermal boundary conditions tested are: uniform wall temperature and insulated walls. Predicted velocity fields, pressure drop, and heat transfer coefficient distributions are compared with corresponding values for laminar flow between parallel plates. Mixing of the jets in such flows is discussed in terms of the variation in temperature profiles in the exit channel. An evaluation of the predictions of different high- and low-Reynolds number turbulence models for turbulent flow and heat transfer in confined impinging and opposing jet configurations is carried out. The heat transfer features of these systems are compared on the basis of equal mass flow rate in the two systems. A parametric study for flow and heat transfer in the turbulent opposing jet case is carried out. The motion and drying of single particles moving in two dimensional opposing jet contactor in the turbulent regime are investigated. The effects of key parameters such as particle size, release position in the inlet jet, jet Reynolds number, and geometry of the contactor on particle residence time and particle moisture content are examined, assuming a power-law model for the falling rate drying kinetics. A two-phase flow model is developed based on a modified stochastic particle-trajectory model. Both turbulence modulation and particle dispersion effects are incorporated in the code. The effect of turbulence intensity on particle-gas heat transfer is included via a new model. A modified algorithm is introduced for the solution of the governing equations. The proposed mathematical model and solution algorithm are applied to selected test problems, e.g. dilute gas-particle flow in a channel. The predicted results compared favorably with results of independent investigations. The two-phase code is employed for a parametric study of the flow and drying characteristics of wet particles in the proposed opposing jet contactor using superheated steam as the drying agent. Predictions are made for various degrees of superheat and operating pressure. The effects of particle size and jet Reynolds numbers are also investigated. The particle residence time and moisture content distributions are predicted and a new method is suggested for an effective use of computer simulation results in the design and analysis of convective dispersion dryers for particulate materials.</description><creator>Hosseinalipour, Seyed Mostafa</creator><contributor>Mujumdar, A.

The computational modelling procedures proposed in the thesis include the modelling of frost heave generation, the constitutive modelling of the frozen soil, the structural behaviour of the pipeline and the constitutive modelling of the soil-pipeline interface. The interactive thermo-hydro-mechanical processes encountered in the problem are generally time-dependent and non-linear. The frost heave modelling utilizes the three-dimensional form of a modified hydrodynamic frost heave model. A finite element implementation of the model is used to estimate the frost heave in a one-dimensional element. The comparison of the numerical results with an experimental result indicates that the prediction by computational modelling can reasonably simulate observations of one-dimensional experiments. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations also indicate that the numerical modelling can predict trends of frost heave development which are consistent with the localized cooling at the base of a cuboidal element. In the development of the interaction effects, the mechanical behaviour of the frozen soil is represented by a complete creep model. The proposed complete creep model can take into consideration all three creep processes associated with frozen soils. Computations have also been conducted to calibrate the predictions of the creep model with observed experimental data. Extensive computations have been performed to investigate the general creep responses of a variety of geotechnical structures. To examine frozen soil-pipeline interaction problems, the pipeline is modelled either as a Bernoulli-Euler beam or as a cylindrical shell which accommodates both flexural and shear stiffness effects. The numerical procedures are applied to examine the pipeline freezing experiment conducted at the large scale facility in Caen, France. The temperature profiles, soil heave, pipeline deformation and flexural moments developed in the pipeline due to the generation of frost heave in the discontinuous frost heave region are documented.</description><creator>Hu, Jun, 1961-</creator><contributor>Selvadurai, A.

This dissertation finds such a theology in the thought of American Lutheran theologian, Joseph Sittler. Sittler characterizes his thought, not as a "theology of nature," but as an "incarnation theology applied to nature." Because of the christological and sacramental emphases in his theology, the dissertation demonstrates that the roots for Sittler's environmental concerns are to be found in the Christology and eucharistic theology of the sixteenth century reformer, Martin Luther. But in order to compensate for the emphasis in sixteenth century reformation theology on redemption as the salvation of the individual from sin, Sittler also retrieves the theology of the second century theologian, Irenaeus of Lyons. In his own fight against gnosticism, Irenaeus demonstrates continuity between Creation and redemption as acts of the same God. Thus Sittler develops a "theology for earth," emphasizing the continuity of nature and grace and, using concepts drawn from literature, music, architecture, painting, and modern physics, articulating an "ontology of communion" in which human beings recognize the presence of God in their own participation in the raw materials and processes of the world.</description><creator>Heggen, Bruce Allen</creator><contributor>Hall, D.

The first Muslim response occurred when the Secular Nationalists proposed, shortly before Indonesia's independence in 1945 and again later in the Constituent Assembly debates (1956-1959), that the Pancasila be the basis of state. The second Muslim response to the Pancasila took place in 1978 when the New Order government proposed that the P4 (Guidelines for Understanding and Practicing the Pancasila) be legalized. The Muslims at first objected to both the proposal of the Pancasila as the foundation of the state and that of the P4, but finally acquiesced. Each stage in this process was marked by debate over the role of Islam in Indonesian society and politics, which often led to antagonism between the government and the Muslim community. When the government proposed in 1982 that the Pancasila serve as the sole basis for all political and mass organizations, the third Muslim response occurred. The Muslims' acceptance of this policy marked the end of the government's application of severe policies towards them and has resulted in the former being allowed to play an even greater role in Indonesian politics than had previously been the case.</description><creator>Ismail, Faisal</creator><contributor>Turgay, A.

To date, those examining this variable have largely relied for the theoretical and methodological support on models imported from psychology. While their studies have arguably had a positive impact on our understanding of some aspects of emotion, this dissertation contends that an over-dependence on psychological theories and methods has resulted in a blinkered approach to its study. In general, the focus of research and scholarship has been on either display and recognition of facial expression, physiological response to environmental stimuli, subjective verbal labeling, and behavioral manifestation. On closer inspection, a positivist discourse which considers emotion in methodologically individualistic and empirically behavioral terms has informed much of this work. Building on behaviorism, intentionalist analytical philosophy, and phenomenology, emotion research in Communication Studies has tended to neglect the social. More sophisticated approaches to grasping this latter variable, found in Sociology and Anthropology, consequently have had little impact, leading communications scholars to consistently define emotion in terms of individual motivations, drives, desires, wants, and dispositions rather than as a process located in a social world. In light of this, this dissertation strove not only to assemble a history and provide a critique of emotion study in psychology, but to relate it to advances being made in Sociology and Anthropology, especially those pertaining to communication and postmodernity. Alongside this, it endeavored to: (1) furnish a theory and methodology for explaining those relationships; (2) illuminate a way in which emotion can be reconceived as a formative and independent social variable integral to the reproduction of postmodernity; and (3) analyze the practices and discourses that have contributed to the historically changing, oftentimes, inconsistent and disputed, study of emotion. After the principle issues were introduced in the opening Chapter, the second Chapter outlined the relationships between emotion, the everyday, media, and postmodernity, with the everyday representing a key theoretical construct necessary for understanding our time. This Chapter closed with an exploration of so-called postmodern emotion. Using several theoretical frameworks, Chapter 3 tracked historical, discursive, and disciplinary interests in emotion and Chapter 4 relations between theories of emotions through pre-modern (5thC B.C.-1890), modern (1890-1960), and postmodern (1960-) periods. Next, Chapter 5 charted the etymologies of the primary emotion terms, while Chapter 6 explored approaches to the study of emotion in Communication Studies, or Communicology. After an initial analysis of 'bibliometric' data, the three primary traditional approaches were then systematically identified and examined. A fourth postmodern approach, the constructionist, was presented and assessed in the last Chapter. There it was argued that, from this perspective, communication constitutes reality and not merely provides a conduit for preformed intentional and emotional states. There, the concept of social emotion was advanced, the idea of emotion as socio-culture performance developed, and a rules based theoretical famework for future research on
communicating emotion devised.

For the 1-propanol and polymer systems, most of the salt was in the bottom phase while the nonionic solute was concentrated in the top phase. In the n-dodecylammonium chloride system the salt was evenly distributed between the phases while most of the surfactant was in the top phase. For the poly(propylene glycol) systems, the size of the region of two liquid phases increases with molecular weight and temperature. A modified form of the Flory-Huggins theory was developed for liquid-liquid equilibrium in binary aqueous systems of nonelectrolytes whose closed-loop phase diagrams contain both upper and lower consolute temperature points. The modification involved the assumption of an adjustable molecular size parameter $ chi sb{12}$. Calculations were performed for 15 aqueous binary systems. The models correlated the liquid-liquid equilibrium data accurately. Liquid-liquid equilibrium in aqueous biphasic salt systems was modelled using an expression for the excess Gibbs energy of the solution. The expression is based on modified forms of the Mean Spherical Approximation, the Bromley equation, and the Flory-Huggins theory. The model requires 3 and 5 adjustable parameters for tenary and quaternary systems, respectively.

The anurans were found to be hosts to over 32 species of macroparasite, as well as a wide variety of protistan and moneran parasites. It was found that a combination of three variables (diet, habitat, abundance), together with host body size accounted for a substantial proportion of the variation in mean parasite richness and parasite species distribution among host species. The relationship between parasites and ecology was found to be independent of host phylogeny. The demonstration of substantial environmental heterogeneity in parasitization predicates that a positive relationship between parasite richness and recombination should be found in this case. This prediction was supported by the data: highly parasitized species of anuran had higher rates of recombination. This is the first study to demonstrate a direct positive relationship between recombination (rather than sex) and parasites.</description><creator>Chandler, Mark</creator><contributor>Bell, Graham (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Host-parasite relationships</subject><subject>Anura -- Parasites -- Amazon River Region</subject><subject>Genetic recombination</subject><subject>Anura -- Amazon River Region -- Genetics</subject><title>The evolutionary ecology of parasitism in relation to recombination in a neotropical community of anurans</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7d278v83j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p2676x354</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q811km28v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:45:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is a contribution to the study of the biblical interpretation of the Italian Reformer Peter Martyr Vermigli (1499-1562). Specifically researched is Martyr's use of the Jewish resources of the 1525 Bomberg Bible in his interpretation of Lamentations, Martyr's earliest surviving commentary. The form of this investigation is as follows: first, an introduction to the use of Jewish resources by Christian students of scripture; secondly, an annotated translation of Martyr's Lamentations commentary; thirdly, conclusions concerning Martyr's use of Jewish commentary. After a select bibliography, there are appendices which include a synopsis of sixteenth century Latin translations of Lamentations and an annotated translation of the Jewish commentators on Lamentations in the 1525 Bomberg Bible. An argument will be made that Martyr drew much useful philology from the Jewish commentators but also unwittingly absorbed considerable non-philological exegesis in order to embellish his commentary and on occasion to evade the results of philological exegesis.</description><creator>Shute, Dan</creator><contributor>McLelland, Joseph C.

The first section presents an investigation of several unconventional film-forming molecules at the air/water interface using the surface film balance apparatus. Strongly hydrophobic fullerenes (C$ sb{60}$ and C$ sb{70}$) were found to spread at the air/water interface to form Langmuir films of multilayer rather than monolayer thicknesses. The formation of these well-defined multilayers is independent of the initial surface density of the fullerene. The films adopt discrete thicknesses of 4-5 monolayer equivalents. The multilayer of the non-spherical C$ sb{70}$ exhibited a transition attributed to a reorientational process that was not observed with the C$ sb{60}$ multilayer. A calculation of the work of compression for the two fullerene films confirmed important differences between the C$ sb{60}$ and C$ sb{70}$ films. 1,3,5- Phenylene-based hydrocarbon starburst dendrimers were also found to form multilayer Langmuir films at the air/water interface. The formation of these multilayers, however, is dependent on the initial surface density of dendrimer, and believed to rely upon interpenetration amongst dendrimer molecules. Langmuir-Blodgett films of dendrimer co-spread with fatty acid were examined by Atomic Force Microscopy. A series of amorphous polyimides also appear to form multilayer Langmuir films, possibly because they adopt a conformation on the water surface that renders them more rigid than in the bulk material. The second section describes the electrochemical and interfacial properties of two series of thiophene/ferrocene conjugates. The detailed electrochemistry of these compounds is described, including their electro-oxidative polymerization and the subsequent characterization of the polymer film. Their unique bifunctional nature leads to the formation of a polymer material that is intrinsically limited to the formation of monolayers. At the air/water interface, these molecules have a well-defined phase transition from a disordered state to an ordered state. Their oxidative polymerization was effected chemically at the air/water interface in both their expanded form, in which they are extended on the water surface, and a more condensed form, although it was observed to proceed more rapidly in the expanded form. In both studies, the properties of the ultrathin films that are formed are discussed in the context of the transition from aggregates to bulk material. The implication of the present results is also discussed with respect to the nature of the surface tension measurement in the surface film balance experiment. Finally, the importance of an architecture imposed by the properties of the molecules such as that observed in the electropolymerization of the thiophene/ferrocene compounds is discussed.</description><creator>Back, Roberta</creator><contributor>Lennox, R.

The two dominant locational theories (Weberian and transactional) are critiqued and three problems are identified: their reliance on simplistic conceptions of industrial organization; their inability to take account of cycles of investment; and their neglect of the social construction of the built environment. A reformulation of urban industrial geography is presented which stresses the diversity of productive strategies open to industries; the relationship of these strategies to rhythms of changes to technology, the labour process, and the organizational structure of firms; and the actions of local growth machines in the making of industrial space. These claims are developed through an empirical examination of Montreal. Using the municipal tax assessment rolls a description of the location of Montreal's manufacturing firms in 1861 and 1890 establishes the context for a discussion of the key dynamics of the city's industrial geography through histories of selected industries (clothing, metal, cotton, and baking) and industrial districts (Saint-Ann and Saint-Henri).</description><creator>Lewis, Robert David</creator><contributor>Olson, S.

The Mossbauer source technique employed in this work offers a direct and unambiguous way to quantitatively determine cobalt site preferences in these compounds at extremely low cobalt contents. Data quality as well as counting efficiency for the source ($ sp{57}$Co doped) samples is enhanced by constructing a resonant conversion electron detector utilising 90% $ sp{57}$Fe enriched stainless steel foil. Our results have produced the most convincing evidence that cobalt substitutes preferentially for iron in these compounds. We have demonstrated that the site volume is the dominant factor controlling the preferential cobalt substitutions at transition-metal sites with volume $&lt;$12.2A$ sp3$. The cobalt preference for a site decreases linearly with increasing site volume at a rate of $ sim$0.9A$ sp{-3}$. In general, cobalt shows a preference for sites with volume $&lt;$11.8A$ sp3$. As site volume becomes sufficiently large ($ ge$12.2A$ sp3$), the negative enthalpy of mixing between cobalt and rare-earth plays a significant role in modifying the cobalt site preferences in combination with the site volume effects. This results in cobalt preferring strongly those sites with the highest number of rare-earth nearest-neighbors.</description><creator>Liao, Lexiang</creator><contributor>Altounian, Zaven (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Chemistry, Analytical.</subject><subject>Chemistry, Inorganic.</subject><title>Cobalt site preferences in iron rare-earth based compounds</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3r074w83d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8w32r719m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h989r471s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:45:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The thesis offers a new framework for inflation as a process of restructuring. Contrary to existing theories of inflation, which tend to take structure and institutions as given for the purpose of analysis, we argue that inflation could be understood only in terms of ongoing structural and institutional change. In the modern context of large-scale business enterprise, inflationary restructuring arises as an integral part of capital accumulation. On the aggregate level, inflation appeals as stagflation, with the expansion of pecuniary values in the 'business' sphere depending on the strategic limitation of productive activity in the 'industrial' realm. This stagflationary interaction between 'business' and 'industry' is, in turn, linked (on the disaggregate level) to the dynamic formation and reformation of 'distributional coalitions' and the process of aggregate concentration. An empirical analysis of the U.S. experience between the early 1950s and the late 1980s reveals two regimes of inflationary restructuring: the first, which lasted until 1970, involved rapid increases in aggregate concentration with relatively modest stagflation, whereas the second, post-1970 regime consisted of stable (or even declining) concentration amidst severe stagflation.</description><creator>Nitzan, Jonathan</creator><contributor>Rowley, J.
