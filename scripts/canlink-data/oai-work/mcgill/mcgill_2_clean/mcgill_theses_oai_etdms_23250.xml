Electron microscopy and $ sp3$H-thymidine radioautography have been used to study kinetics of the component cells and obtain an estimate of their life duration. The isthmus includes four immature cell types: granule free cells which function as stem cells directly giving rise to two other immature cell types named pre-pit and pre-neck cells, while the fourth or pre-parietal cells come from the stem cells and its two descendants. Pre-pit cells evolve into pit cells, which migrate along the pit while producing dense mucous granules and, in 3 days, reach the surface where they are phagocytosed or extruded to the lumen. Pre-parietal cells become the acid-producing parietal cells, which migrate from the isthmus; about 20% up the pit and the remaining 80%, to the neck. Parietal cells in either pit or base eventually degenerate, die and are phagocytosed or released either to the unit lumen or even into connective tissue spaces after an overall life of 67 days. Pre-neck cells become neck cells which descend along the neck in 40 days while producing cored mucous granules. They then become muco-zymogenic cells, which further transform into the pepsin-producing zymogenic cells. These, after a 256 day mean life, degenerate or are attacked by connective tissue macrophages.</description><creator>Karam, Sherif Mohamed</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Biology, Anatomy.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>Cell dynamics in the body (corpus) of the mouse stomach</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6395w812z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pk02cb68r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anatomy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1g05fc41f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:01:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this study was to investigate effects of listener requests for clarification on dysfluency behavior and information content of stutterers' and nonstutterers' responses. Subjects were 40 boys (20 stutterers and 20 nonstutterers) between the ages of 5;0-6;8 years and 8;5-10;0 years. Two listener requests, "What?" and "I don't understand" were delivered on a time contingent basis during a one-hour conversation with the subject. Fluency and dysfluency measures included frequency and duration of stuttered words, within-word dysfluencies, pauses, and speech rate. Repair strategies were coded according to information content. Results indicated that responding to requests for clarification significantly decreased the frequency of dysfluencies for both groups. Stutterers were similar to nonstutterers in information content of repair strategy. Groups differed on pause measures, and there was a tendency for older children's fluency to be more disrupted by requests. Older children also used significantly more information in their responses to "I don't understand".</description><creator>Fortier-Blanc, Julie</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Health Sciences,

formation in discharge plasmas. The ionic species from the plasma are sampled into a quadrupole mass spectrometer through a metal leak arrangement which itself acts as a Langmuir-type probe. This behaviour is substantiated by specific ion sampling probe characteristics for a microwave discharge plasma in flowing nitrogen at low pressures (9 to 27 microns). The beam of positive ions extracted from the microwave discharge source is composed of N^+, N2^+ and N3^+ ,N2^+ being the dominant ion. The kinetic energy distribution curves for individual ionic species are obtained under a variety of conditions of sampling probe potential, pressure, and electron temperature by a retarding potential applied to the entrance grid of the mass filter. The curves are discussed in terms of the currently accepted sheath model. The interpretations indicate that ion generation processes and ion-molecule collisions occurring in the sheath may strongly interfere with the sampling process.</description><creator>Böhme, Diethard Kurt.</creator><contributor>Goodings, J.

Of these inorganic ions, the marine bacteria so far examined in contrast to most terrestrial bacterial species have been found to possess a specific requirement for Na+ for growth. The Na+ requirement for growth has been found to reflect a requirement for the transport of nutrients in marine bacterial cells. This and other information regarding the characteristics of marine bacteria have come from the studies of only a few representatives of a very small fraction of the bacterial population in the sea, and one may well ask how far these observations made with a few species are true for marine bacteria as a group of organisms? In this thesis observations made on non-luminous marine bacteria have been extended to include some representative luminous marine bacteria. In the course of these studies some similarities and differences in the nutrition and metabolism of the two groups of organisms have been noted.</description><creator>Srivastava, Vinod Shanker.</creator><contributor>MacLeod, R.

The charts of 35 heart transplant recipients (n = 32 males and 3 females) were reviewed retrospectively up until three years post transplantation, to describe a time-course of hypercholesterolemia after transplantation, and to determine the mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis. All patients received prednisone, cyclosporine, and azathioprine for immunosuppression. A progressive rise in both serum cholesterol (2.4 $ pm$ 0.4 mmol/l, p $&lt;$ 0.01), and body weight (8.4 $ pm$ 1.6 kg, p $&lt;$ 0.01) were observed during the first 8 and 10 months respectively. Levels stabilized thereafter, remaining above pretransplant levels. Triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were all above normal limits following transplantation. Tapering of prednisone dose had a significant effect on serum cholesterol levels, whereas diet had a beneficial effect on body weight. A randomized, controlled, dietary intervention study then followed to further assess the effect of dietary intervention on minimizing or preventing post transplantation hyperlipidemia and weight gain. Five patients were counselled the Step One Lipid-Lowering diet, two patients were controls. All study patients demonstrated a lower overall increase in serum cholesterol levels than other transplant recipients. Reported nutritional intakes were similar between both groups. Increases in body weight were related to increases in body fat. Patients in the diet group demonstrated improvements in their level of nutrition knowledge, which correlated with lower serum cholesterol levels. Changes in serum cholesterol were also associated with appetite, hunger, perceived interest, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, and attitudes toward food. Changes in body weight were associated with appetite, hunger, perceived barriers, and stress.

Nine similar but distinct mouse Bgp cDNA clones have been isolated and characterized. These Bgp isoforms encode polypeptides that contain multiple Ig domains, a single transmembrane domain and a short or long intracytoplasmic domain. Sequence analyses have demonstrated that Bgp isoforms are generated through complex alternative splicing of a single gene and allelic variation. Mouse Bgp proteins are highly expressed in the epithelial cells of the liver and the intestine and are implicated in diverse cellular functions including cell adhesion and bile acid transport, and are postulated to be involved in signal transduction. Investigation into the expression of mouse Bgp isoforms in normal and malignant tissues revealed that Bgp expression is downregulated in tumors. Furthermore, Bgp expression is influenced by transcriptional control mechanisms involving DNA methylation of the Bgp gene upstream regulatory regions.</description><creator>Rosenberg, Madelaine</creator><contributor>Beauchemin, Nicole (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>The characterization and expression of mouse biliary glycoproteins in normal and malignant tissues /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nz806062f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/02870w700</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8336h2734</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:01:36Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The appearance of the contemporary suburb is one of its most criticized and problematic features. Architects find themselves challenged by its increasing size and complicated planning issues. These challenges are compounded because traditional methods of control do not specifically confront these issues. A less comprehensive method of control, design codes, has recently emerged to address some of the limitations associated with traditional forms of control. This thesis is a survey of five design codes used in contemporary suburbs. Specific focus is given to examining the organization and objectives of design codes, and what architectural elements are regulated. The survey suggests that the most noticeable features of design codes is that they are specific to a project and site, address unique objectives of a particular community, and specifically address suburban design problems. This underlines the essential role design codes have in reshaping and ultimately improving the diminished appearance of the contemporary suburb.</description><creator>Dent, Laura E.</creator><contributor>Rybczynski, Witold (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>City planning</subject><subject>Architecture, Domestic -- Designs and plans.</subject><subject>Building laws</subject><title>A survey of design codes with specific reference to contemporary suburban housing /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pv63g099h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8336h2734</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fn106z90v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:01:36Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Filarete's treatise presents architecture, the new archaized mode of building, to Francesco Sforza as the means to historiate and recuperate his insurgent regime, which had overturned the preceding dynastic order of power. This thesis shows how the treatise tried to persuade a powerful but retardatory new prince not yet absorbed by the legitimizing narrative of a renascence of antiquity. It focuses on the treatise's narrative, and places it in its political situation, to show that Filarete made a dramatic, polemical opposition between building and architecture, which he will be shown to have defined as those techniques of assuring the arche.</description><creator>Hayes, Kenneth L.</creator><contributor>Perez-Gomez, Alberto (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Filarete, ca. 1400-ca. 1469</subject><subject>Architecture</subject><title>Machiavelli's architect : Filarete and the Arché</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9g54xj48g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fn106z90v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:t722h9695</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:01:36Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A study aimed at investigating the performance of pultruded fibre glass reinforced plastic (FGRP) materials subjected to both the time-independent and the time-dependent response of angle stubs and coupons was conducted. Angle stubs and coupons were made of isophtalic polyester resin reinforced with an E-glass fibre glass mat of 35%-45% of the weight. The stub dimensions were of 50.8 mm $ times$ 50.8 mm $ times$ 6.35 mm and their length was 305 mm. The compression coupons were cut in a prismatic shape according to ASTM Standard D695-89 with 12.70 mm $ times$ 6.35 mm cross-section and a length of 31.75 mm. In the time-independent short-term study, the FGRP angle stubs and coupons were subjected to axial compression loading with two different testing configurations. In the time-dependent long-term study, three angle stubs were first subjected to a 350 hour preliminary creep test, followed by 150 hours of creep recovery, with three lengths and configurations of strain gauges. Finally, a last series of tests was carried out on three angle stubs instrumented with 12 5-mm long gauges. Coupon creep tests were carried out in parallel with the stub tests. The total duration of the tests was 2500 hours in creep and 250 hours in creep recovery. Results indicate a scatter in the order of 15% in creep strain measurements after 2500 hours, for both stub and coupon tests. Predictions using Findley's power law with creep parameters determined from the stub tests and coupon tests are in excellent agreement, both with one another and with actual creep strain measurements on the stubs. The Boltzman superposition principle was used to compare the experimental creep recovery results with predictions from Findley's model, and excellent agreement was also observed.

Two tasks measured subjects' abilities to make same/different judgments about prosodic patterns which had been filtered of the linguistic content, while six tasks required subjects to identify typical linguistic or affective meanings for intonation contours. The six identification tasks varied in the amount of linguistic structure available to subjects during auditory perception; stimuli were either filtered of their phonetic content, presented as nonsense utterances, or provided appropriate semantic information which biased the prosodic target. Unilateral damage to either cerebral hemisphere did not impair subjects' ability to discriminate prosodic patterns, or to recognize the affective mood conveyed through prosody. Contrary to expectation, RHD patients performed comparably in both propositional and affective contexts, and thus did not show evidence of a specific disturbance of emotional prosody. LHD patients, however, were differentially impaired on linguistic tasks rather than emotional tasks when compared to the NC group, even when semantic information biased the target response. The results are discussed with respect to theories of lateralized processing of linguistic and affective prosody.</description><creator>Pell, Marc D.</creator><contributor>Baum, Shari R.

The main purposes of this investigation were to determine normative anthropometric standards and to identify their important determinants. A structured questionnaire was administered by interviewers and anthropometric measurements were completed on 473 non-pregnant women randomly selected and stratified by 5 year age categories from 8 peasant associations. Women in this study sample were light with a mean (SD) weight of 46.9 (5.3) kg. Approximately three quarters weighed less than 50 kg and 34 (7%) less than 40 kg. Women's height averaged 155.5 cm with nearly 20% under 150 cm. The mean (SD) BMI was 19.4 (1.9) kg/m$ sp2$ and 35% of the women had a BMI lower than 18.5 kg/m$ sp2$. Means for all anthropometric measurements fell below the 10th percentile of the standard, NCHS reference for black women. No consistent predictor was found across the various anthropometric outcomes. In particular, all anthropometric outcomes were stable across age categories. The relationship between these anthropometric measures and adverse maternal or perinatal outcomes need to be validated.</description><creator>Taddese, Zerihun</creator><contributor>Larson, Charles (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Women's Studies.</subject><subject>Biology, Biostatistics.</subject><title>Anthropometric status of Oromo women of childbearing age in rural southwestern Ethiopia</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8s45q979m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qr46r179n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:b2773w487</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:01:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this thesis project was to assess the value of chest radiographs as a screening tool for the diagnosis of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH). Two "gold standard" physicians identified 45 DISH patients and 106 control patients (45 with thoracic spondylosis, 45 with "normal" spines, and 16 with ankylosing spondylitis). The chest x-rays on the 151 subjects were randomized and read independently using an ordinal diagnostic certainty scale by two "test" radiologists, experienced in reading bone radiographs. The average results for the two test radiologists were: sensitivity = 77%; specificity = 97%; positive predictive value = 91%; and, negative predictive value = 91%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves was 0.975 and 0.976 for the radiologists, respectively, suggesting that inter-rater reliability was very high. A second reading showed that the intra-rater reliability was exceptional (weighted kappa of 0.90 and 0.96 for the two "test" radiologists). DISH patients whose chest x-rays were read as not demonstrating DISH had significantly less extensive disease. We conclude that chest x-rays are a reliable and valid screening tool for the diagnosis of DISH.</description><creator>Mata, Sonia</creator><contributor>Esdaile, John M.

The same LFSR that is used to generate pseudo-random patterns, is loaded with seeds from which it produces vectors that cover the testcubes which detect faults that are hard to test. The scheme is compatible with scan-design and achieves full coverage as it is based on random patterns combined with a deterministic test set. Two methods for processing a test set to allow for efficient encoding of testcubes as LFSR seeds are proposed. The first method involves merging pairwise consistent testcubes in the test set. The second method involves concatenating the original testcubes to form longer testcubes. This allows multiple testcubes to be encoded into a single LFSR seed. Algorithms to perform merging and concatenation of the test set are presented. An algorithm for calculating LFSR seeds from the test set is described. A method to balance testcubes with respect to the feedback polynomials of the multiple polynomial LFSR is proposed. This allows the encoding of feedback polynomials to be done implicitly by the ordering of testcubes. An algorithm for the selection and ordering of feedback polynomials is presented. Experimental results are provided for the ISCAS-85 and ISCAS-89 benchmark circuits to demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme. The scheme allows an excellent trade-off between test data storage and test application time (number of test patterns) with a very small hardware overhead. We show the trade-off between test data storage and number of test patterns under the scheme.</description><creator>Venkataraman, Srikanth</creator><contributor>Rajski, Janusz (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Built-in self test based on reseeding of linear feedback shift registers</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gq67jr986.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mc87pr12z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7w62f9087</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:01:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Neural networks have recently regained significant interest in the scientific community for their ability to generalize about large samples of data. In this thesis, the feasibility of applying neural networks in the domain of telephone access network fault identification and localization is explored. Firstly, the access network and the computerized work environment of today's Repair Service Bureaus are described. A survey of past and present automated diagnosis systems used in communications follows. Neural networks are then presented and the back-propagation learning algorithm is given particular attention. Another literature review ensues where neural network based diagnosis systems from a number of domains are presented. Finally, the first components for an improved access network maintenance system are laid. Experimental results show that the opportunity exists to benefit from neural networks pattern classification ability in access network maintenance. A discussion of results and suggestions for future research work ends this thesis.</description><creator>Groleau, François</creator><contributor>Malowany, Alfred S.

Current research often involves small mammals (mice, rats or guinea pigs) which are easily obtained in large numbers as pure bred strains, thus allowing statistically reliable results with minimal inter-animal variation to be obtained. However, due to the small flow amplitudes involved, the input impedance of common flow measurement devices is often too low to reliably measure tracheal flow. Furthermore, experimental setups are usually very limited in the types of volume, pressure or flow perturbations they can apply to the respiratory system. The computer controlled research ventilator for small animals described here overcomes both problems. Tracheal flow is estimated from the position of the ventilator piston and the pressure within the cylinder. Furthermore, the setup is capable of applying any desired volume perturbation with a bandwidth up to 55 Hz.</description><creator>Schuessler, Thomas F.</creator><contributor>Bates, Jason H. T.
