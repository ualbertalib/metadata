These anisotropies have been associated with differences in morphology (crystallinity) and orientation (shrinkage and birefringences) at various positions in the molding. They are reflected by anisotropies in tensile properties measured at different points or in different directions. However, no work has been reported to quantitatively relate the distributions in tensile properties. The present work represents an attempt to meet this challenge. Microstructure determination is achieved by making the following measurements on microtomed specimens at different positions in the polyethylene moldings: density, sonic speed, birefringence, wide-angle X-ray diffraction, dichroic ratio, and polarized light photomicrography. The above tests yield data relating to crystallinity and orientation functions for both the crystalline and amorphous phases. They also yield sufficient data to check the consistency of results obtained by the different techniques. Tensile properties are measured on microtomed samples obtained from the same regions tested for microstructure. Finally, the distributions of tensile and sonic moduli in the molding are estimated by employing some of the theoretical techniques proposed in the literature. The results show very good agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental data relating to the distributions of both sonic moduli and tensile moduli.</description><creator>Moy, Francis H.</creator><date>1980</date><subject>Injection molding of plastics.</subject><title>Microstructure and the distribution of tensile properties in injection molded polyethylene</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0r967457f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z903087j</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6h440t251</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:57:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The naturally occurring compound 3,6-bis-(5-chloro-2-piperidyl)-2,5-piperazinedione (1) is a promising new antitumor drug. The mechanisms of action of antitumor alkylating agents, particularly the nitrogen mustards and sesquiterpene lactones, suggest possible modes of antitumor activity of compound 1. A possible synthetic scheme for compound 1 is developed by consideration of methods of synthesis of piperidines, (alpha)-substituted-(alpha),(beta)-unsaturated esters, and (beta)-amino alcohols. A synthesis of (alpha)-chloro-(alpha),(beta)-unsaturated esters from carbonyl compounds and t-butyl (alpha)-chloro-(alpha)-trimethylsilyl acetate is developed. Oxyamination of the terminal double bond of t-butyl 2-chloro-2,6-heptadienoate occurs by epoxidation and reaction with an amine or azide ion and by osmium tetroxide catalyzed reaction with Chloramine-T. The piperidine ring is formed by an internal Michael raction of t-butyl 2-chloro-6-t-butyldimethylsilyloxy-7-tosylamino-2-heptenoate. The amino acid (1-tosyl-5-hydroxy-2-piperidyl) glycine is synthesized and found to be unstable to acidic esterification conditions. Strategies for overcoming the problems encountered in the synthesis are discussed.</description><creator>Moreland, Margaret.</creator><date>1979</date><subject>Cancer -- Chemotherapy.</subject><subject>Chemotherapy.</subject><title>Studies toward the synthesis of 3,6-bis-(5-chloro-2-piperidyl)-2, 5-piperazinedione</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/05741s600.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6h440t251</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wh246s90n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:57:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is concerned with the relationship between choline delivery and acetylcholine synthesis in the cat superior cervical ganglion. Increasing extracellular choline did not change the amount of acetylcholine either contained in or released by ganglia, except when choline levels were increased by 100-fold in plasma. In the latter case, most of the extra ACh formed was not releasable and may have accumulated as a result of decreased acetylcholine degradation rather than increased acetylcholine synthesis. Choline transport activity in stimulated ganglia can be monitored using choline analogues and this process was found to have similar, but not identical, characteristics as the high affinity choline transport described for synaptosomes. Under certain conditions, the uptake and acetylation of choline were dissociated and, therefore, choline transport alone does not determine the rate of acetylcholine synthesis. Choline transport is activated following a conditioning stimulus, and under these conditions choline uptake is closely related to acetylcholine synthesis. It is suggested that the relationship between choline uptake and acetylation changes with the functional state or history of cholinergic neurons.</description><creator>O'Regan, Seana.</creator><date>1980</date><subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</subject><title>The relationship between choline supply and acetylcholine synthesis /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w0892b67r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wh246s90n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fb494939j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:57:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Several hypotheses concerning the role of fishes in influencing nutrient dynamics in freshwater ecosystems were examined in Lake Memphremagog (Quebec-Vermont). Phosphorus excretion by fishes provides a negligible amount (&lt; 0.33%) in comparison to the quantity taken up by the seston. The phosphorus pools present in the seston and fish community were approximately equal and both were twice the phosphorus content in the zooplankton. Part of this nutrient reservoir is released during the decomposition of fish carcasses. The potential is dependent upon post-spawning mortality rate, the fate of phosphorus in decomposing fish tissue, and the concentrations of allochthonous phosphorus entering the lake. Daily losses of epilimnetic phosphorus from the seston due to fish (up to 40%) and enhancement of nutrient excretion by zooplankton due to size-selective predation are important when open water fish populations are mainly planktivores. When benthic, detrital, or faculative consumers predominate, as in Lake Memphremagog, the effect of fishes on nutrient dynamics through foraging pressure is probably small.</description><creator>Nakashima, Brian Shyozo.</creator><date>1979</date><subject>Phosphorus in animal nutrition.</subject><title>The contribution of fishes to phosphorus cycling in lakes /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4b29b7038.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fb494939j</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h989r392b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:57:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Spirochetes are markedly prevalent in periodontal disease but are not included as predominant cultivable organisms because of the inability to quantify them by viable count. A successful method was developed for enumerating viable oral spirochetes in pure culture as colony-forming units (CFU) in new oral spirochete (NOS) medium with 0.7% agarose and using small tissue-culture flasks. Three species of oral spirochetes in log-phase growth in NOS broth were used for evaluation of the method. Reliable, consistent and reproducible viable counts of pure spirochete cultures were obtained. This method was extended to enumerate viable oral spirochetes from periodontal pockets. The antibiotic rifampin (20 $ mu$g/ml) was found to be an excellent selective agent for such a count when added to NOS-agarose medium. Counts of cultivable oral spirochetes from 10 subgingival plaque samples ranged from 12.5% to 28.2% of the total cultivable anaerobic bacteria. In addition, by the use of this method thirteen new oral spirochetes were isolated. The viable count technique was modified and employed to study the locomotion of spirochetes. Migration of oral spirochetes out of NOS-Bacto agar medium into NOS-agarose medium was observed and two locomotory phenotypes of oral spirochetes were detected.</description><creator>Qiu, Yu-Shan</creator><contributor>Chan, Z.

Randomized C57BL/6 x AF1 (B6AF$ sb1$) mice were injected with C57BL/6 (B6) lymphoid cells and sacrificed at predetermined times after transplantation for bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) tissue analysis. The liver, the spleen and the sera from some acute GVH reactive mice first tested positive for LPS from day 2, 4 and 16 post transplant, respectively. Total hepatic and splenic LPS in acute GVH reactive mice peaked, and LPS was first detected in the sera of these same animals, at a time coincident with the onset of mortality.

Fish abundance and sizes were higher in the reserve than in surrounding non-reserve areas. Relative differences in abundance and size between reserve and non-reserve of different taxa were positively correlated to vulnerability to traps (the most common fishing method) but not to mobility of fish. Gradients of abundance across the reserve boundaries (decreasing abundance with distance from the reserve center) were apparent for total abundance but not for individual taxa. These patterns suggest that the reserve does protect fish stocks and that emigration is of minor importance.</description><creator>Rakitin, Ana</creator><contributor>Kramer, Donald L.

The effects of these ingredients on pion yields at beam kinetic energies in the range (0.4 AGeV-1.8 AGeV), and pion energy spectra at 90$ sp circ$ are analyzed.

Densities of D. antillarum were negatively correlated with eutrophication levels, and interpretations of their effects have been made simultaneously. Abundance of F. fragum was lower on more eutrophic reefs with lower D. antillarum densities. This may result from effects of eutrophication and of D. antillarum on algal cover on reefs. Macrophytic algae were more abundant, and crustose coralline algae less abundant, on eutrophic reefs with lower D. antillarum densities; and macrophytic algal cover was negatively correlated with crustose coralline algal cover across reefs. F. fragum abundance was positively correlated with crustose coralline algal cover, and F. fragum occurred less frequently on reef areas where macrophytic algae were abundant. High eutrophication and low D. antillarum density (grazing pressure) may therefore reduce F. fragum abundance by increasing the cover of macrophytic algae relative to crustose coralline algae on reefs. Neither planulation periodicity, colony fecundity, nor polyp fecundity in F. fragum differed at different eutrophication levels and D. antillarum densities. Moreover, adult growth and adult mortality did not differ with eutrophication levels and D. antillarum densities on reefs. However, growth of juveniles appeared slower and mortality higher on eutrophic reefs with low D. antillarum densities. Moreover, larvae of F. fragum preferred to settle on crustose coralline algae than on turf algae (macrophytic algae), and the former are comparatively scarce on eutrophic reefs with low D. antillarum densities. The results suggest that the negative correlation between adult abundance of F. fragum and eutrophication levels/grazing pressure (D. antillarum densities) on Barbados reefs are caused primarily by effects</description><creator>Mann, Gary S.

Paired females were exposed to three levels of Dicofol. Integrity of the reproductive tract of the resulting embryos were examined. Viable eggs were hatched and these birds were permitted to breed the following year. Breeding performance for these birds was measured based on their ability to form pair bonds and exhibit normal behaviour in the presence of a mate. Clutch completion, fertility, hatchability and number of hatchlings reared to fledging were used as reproductive parameters. Females dosed with 20 ppm Dicofol laid eggs that were significantly (p $&lt;$ 0.05) thinner than eggs of control birds. Male embryos from dosed females were significantly (p $&lt;$ 0.05) different from control chicks. Feminization was confirmed by the presence of primordial germ cells. Second generation adults showed altered reproductive parameters related to their parental dose groups. Rank-order trials were conducted on second generation males based on parental dose levels to determine the aggressiveness of these individuals when placed in a competitive arena. Primary perch sites and food items were obtained by control birds significantly (p $&lt;$ 0.05) more often than exposed males.</description><creator>MacLellan, Kelly N. M.

CCFP certification, patient caseload, and proportion of patient caseload tested for thydroi functioning. This study found significant variation in the degree of compliance wlth TFT guidelines. On average, physician-ordered thyroid function tests complied wlth guidelines only 37% of the time. Very little of the variation (approximately 7%) was explained by the characteristics examined. Although the explanatory power of this model was low, oertain characteristics appear to contribute to better compliance. They are: being male, practicing in the southern third of the province, practicing in an urban location, having CCFP certification, and testing proportionately more of one's patient caseload for thyroid functioning. The results of this study suggest that physicians require better training regarding TFT and that further research should be done to understand the marked differences in compliance by gender and geographic location.</description><creator>McKechnie, Joanne</creator><contributor>Bailar, John (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Health Sciences, General.</subject><title>Physician characteristics and compliance with thyroid function testing practice guidelines</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z029p552n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w3763771k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:41687j330</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:57:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The objectives achieved in this thesis are: (1) to develop a new method for measuring the most important acid buffering mechanism within a soil ecosystem-mineral weathering and (2) to test a soil acidification simulation model against actual field data to determine which soil acidifying or buffering mechanisms seem to be understood and which mechanisms need more detailed analysis. First, a new method was developed that allows for quantification of H$ sp+$ consumption due to weathering and H$ sp+$ consumption due to cation exchange. Initial results yield mineral weathering rates that are well within the range of results obtained by other workers. This technique permits the analysis of multiple soil samples in a relatively short time, allowing for better quantification of spatial variability of mineral weathering within a soil ecosystem. Secondly, it was demonstrated that the acid simulation model generally underestimates soil chemistry values for pH, base cation saturation and soil solution base cations, and overestimates soil solution nitrate concentrations. Problems with obtaining accurate measurements of atmospheric dry deposition, a lack of data on cycling of nutrient elements and the absence of a sub-model to deal with the accumulation and mineralization of organic matter are reasons thought to explain the differences between model and field results.</description><creator>McCourt, George H.</creator><contributor>Hendershot, W.

Rev mediates its effect, in part, through interaction with a cis-acting RNA target sequence, the Rev responsive element (RRE), located within the env region of the viral structural mRNAs. There exist transdominant Rev mutants that are capable of binding to the RRE yet are unable to carry out wild-type Rev function, strongly suggesting that cellular cofactors are involved in the Rev response. Towards the isolation of such factors and the elucidation of the mechanism of Rev action, we have developed a highly efficient, one-step, non-denaturing purification protocol for a recombinant form of Rev (H6Rev) and a transdominant mutant of Rev (H6AC4). These recombinant proteins contain six histidine residues at the N-terminus which enable their purification using nickel-affinity chromatography and which can also serve as a means to isolate Rev-host factor complexes reconstituted in vitro. Both purified proteins form stable complexes with the RRE in vitro while only H6Rev exhibits wild-type Rev function in vivo when exogenously introduced into mammalian cells, confirming that the purification strategy employed retains the biological activity of the proteins. To complement the in vitro reconstitution experiments, we have generated human lymphoid cell lines that express biologically active H6Rev in a tightly regulated, inducible fashion. These cell lines can serve as a source for the isolation of Rev-host factor complexes formed in the mammalian cell. Controlled expression of H6Rev is achieved using a tetracycline-modulated promoter. By varying the concentration of tetracycline in the medium, the activity of this promoter, and hence the level of H6Rev expression, can be modulated over a wide range of concentration.</description><creator>Harakidas, Penelope</creator><contributor>Cochrane, Alan Walter (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Development of systems for the isolation of cellular cofactors involved in HIV-1 rev function</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kk91fm43k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9019s339f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9c67wn63b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:57:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The effect of a low-Cu diet supplied to gilts during pregnancy and early lactation on dams and their offspring was obtained in seven pairs of first littermate gilts. They were housed in stainless steel metabolism cages in a controlled environment and fed semi-purified diets containing either 2.13 or 12.25 ppm Cu from 30 days of gestation through two weeks of lactation. Feed intake was restricted to 2 kg/day during pregnancy and 4 kg/day in the first two weeks of lactation. Reproductive performance of gilts was measured. Balance studies were conducted at 30, 60 and 100 days of gestation. Mineral levels in the plasma of gilts and piglets, and in colostrum and milk were determined. The low-Cu diet did not affect (p $&gt;$ 0.05) weight changes during pregnancy. The duration of parturition was shorter for low-Cu than for control gilts (3.19h vs 5.71h, p  0.05). Low-Cu gilts had lower plasma Cu in early- and mid-gestation and farrowed piglets with lower plasma Cu and higher plasma Zn concentrations (p  0.05). Plasma Cu and Fe levels of newborn piglets were lower than those of their dams (p  0.05). Low-Cu gilts had lower Cu and higher Zn content in colostrum and also lower Cu in milk than control gilts (p  0.05). Colostrum was richer in Cu and Zn than milk (p  0.05). Higher dry matter digestibility was observed in low-Cu gilts during early gestation (p  0.05). Compared to control gilts, the low-Cu gilts tended to have higher Cu and Zn retention which was achieved by reduction of fecal Cu and Zn excretion. Utilization of minerals appeared to increase as pregnancy progressed.</description><creator>Cao, Jiayin</creator><contributor>Chavez, E. R.

(1986). The primary advantage of using these models is that they are easily implemented on massively parallel computers and as a result are extremely fast. The first of these studies is of a model of phase separation in binary fluids. The growth laws of the fluid domains are examined and are shown to compare favourably to theoretical predictions of San Miguel et al. (1985). This appears to be a first verification of these results. The second study is of the critical behavior of a system of binary fluids. The model is shown to have a phase transition and the critical temperature is determined with an accuracy of 1%. Several critical exponents are also determined and evidence is provided that the model falls into the 2D Ising model universality class. A new model of fluid convection is also presented though no concrete results are yet available for this model.</description><creator>Howes, Karsten</creator><contributor>Grant, Martin (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Physics, Fluid and Plasma.</subject><title>Lattice gases in statistical physics : a study of phase separation, critical behavior and other phenomena</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t148fh96k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rv38b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zp38wd61f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:57:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Ethnobotanical and dietary questionnaires were used to assess the utilization of plants to treat the signs and symptoms of anemia by women in La Chapelle, Haiti.

Lipase from Candida rugosa resolved methyl $ alpha$-substituted phenylacetates -5. These substrates were examined to understand the influence of steric and the electronic nature of the substituents at the chiral center on the enantioselectivity. Crude CRL was partially enantioselective towards substrates -3, and highly selective towards and, E $&gt;$ 100. Partial purification of crude CRL by 2-propanol extraction and separation by an ion exchange chromatography, dramatically improved the enantioselectivity towards -3, E $&gt;$ 100. One main lipase fraction, F$ sb{ rm C}$ was obtained with 58 fold purification and 62% yield. This improvement in enantioselectivity was achieved with a simple dialysis against deionized water or 50% 2-propanol extraction. Lauric acid (10 mM), partially reversed the increase in the enantioselectivity. The absolute configuration of the favored enantiomer for crude and partially purified lipase preparations, was S. Other lipases with opposite stereoselectivities were not identified. Based on literature and our results, it is believed that the size of the substituents at the stereogenic carbon center can account for the enantioselectivity of CRL catalyzed hydrolysis. The opposite configuration is not preferred when the electronic nature of the medium size substituent is varied. The rule can predict the selectivity data for partially purified CRL preparations. We believe that the accuracy of the rule can be improved if more examples of partially purified CRL reactions are examined.</description><creator>Ahmed, Sharmin Nayela</creator><contributor>Kazlauskas, R.

This research was aimed at understanding the cause of some of these differences. Survey questionnaires were sent to personnel managers in Norway (N = 195) and Quebec (N = 172). The personnel managers were asked to rate: (1) aspects related to their firms' organizational characteristics (business environment, strategy, and structure), and (2) the importance of different personality traits for applicants to managerial and professional positions. Consistent with earlier research (Rynes &amp; Gerhart, 1990) the results indicate that preferences for different applicant attributes represent shared perceptions due to common organizational membership. These preferences are to some degree related to company strategy, organizational structure and national culture. In general, it was found that personnel managers currently seek candidates who can adapt to change and generate new ideas. The results are discussed in light of theories from industrial/organizational and cross-cultural psychology, and suggestions for further research are offered.</description><creator>Worren, Nicolay A.

Fourteen male long distance runners performed two 90 minute runs on an outdoor 400m track at velocities equal to 65 and 80% of VO$ sb2$max. Prior to and following each 90 minute run, running economy (RE) was measured as the steady-state VO$ sb2$ during treadmill runs at speeds of 188 and 228 m/min. During the 90-min run at 65% of VO$ sb2$max, the mean weight loss was 1.3 kg. The HR was 143 bpm between minutes 5-10 and increased to 150 bpm between minutes 85-90. During the 90-min run at 80% of VO$ sb2$max, the mean weight loss was 1.4 kg. The HR was 161 bpm between minutes 5-10 and increased to 165 bpm between minutes 85-90. When the post RE test was conducted following each 90-min run, there was a significant increase in VO$ sb2$ expressed in both l/min and ml/kg$ cdot$min (a decrease in running economy). The increase in oxygen cost of running following the 90-min run at 80% of VO$ sb2$max was greater than that following the run at 65% of VO$ sb2$max.</description><creator>Xu, Fan, 1960-</creator><contributor>Montgomery, David L.

The religious doctrine which evolved from this religious revival movement condoned and legitimized both the formation of modern Saudi Arabia under the rule of the al-Saud family and the Ikhwan. Hence, Wahhabism is the underlying theme to three historical events: the first Wahhabi movement of the 1700s, the Ikhwan under Ibn Saud and the Neo-Ikhwan under al-Utaybi. All of these events should be regarded as one movement, where Wahhabism provides the link or key to understanding the Ikhwan not only as a political/military organization but as a religious movement as well.</description><creator>Zamiska, Donna L.</creator><contributor>Adams, Charles J.

This thesis distinguishes itself from these earlier works by bracketing discussion concerning the elite-level political transitions that occured in order to concentrate on the democratization and socialization of the Spanish and Brazilian societies. The work focuses on a number of collective organizations that emerge during these transitions, and will postulate an argument as to why they should be referred to as "transformation movements". Two important questions that the thesis addresses while examining these cases are: "why do these movements emerge under authoritarian regimes," and "what is it about transformation movements that merits some type of differentiation from other types of collective action?". The significance of these questions to the understanding of "transformation movements", and the role of these movements in the transitions that occured in Spain and Brazil, unfolds in the work that follows.</description><creator>O'Connell, Timothy S.

Chapter one of this thesis includes a brief biography of Horvath. The second chapter comprises a short history of the 'Volksstuck', Horvaths interpretation of the genre and its implications for his plays as well as a summary of the final version "'Geschichten aus dem Wiener Wald.' Volksstuck in drei Teilen." The thesis further attempts to recreate a genealogy of the dramatic characters Zauberkonig, Alfred, Marianne and Oskar and to give possible reasons for their dramaturgical changes up to the development of the final version. In addition the thesis concerns itself with one example for the development of stage directions. Political as well as religious implications are considered alone and in connection with the characters.</description><creator>Mueller, Ruediger H.</creator><contributor>Trudis Goldsmith-Reber (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Literature, Germanic.</subject><subject>Horváth, Ödön von, 1901-1938.

They did this because they were convinced that the aesthetic dimension of their work resided in the structure of the work. More specifically, the artists of the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance believed that the particular aesthetic experience which geometric compositional structure provides corresponded to Christian mystical experience. Thus a work of art that combined geometric structure, naturalistic style, and Christian imagery could provide an experience analogous to that of Christian revelation. This paper traces the development of this idea from its origin in the Old Testament tradition, its formalization in Greek thought and its full flowering in early Christian painting.</description><creator>Morgan, David</creator><contributor>McLelland, J.

It is proposed that there are actually two tough constructions, each derived by a different kind of movement. Three kinds of data which support the claim made here are presented: tough constructions with scrambling, tough constructions with reflexives, and nominals derived from tough constructions. It is argued that non-movement analysis is not appropriate and that both tough constructions are derived by movement. It is shown that tough constructions with a 'tend to' reading can also be accommodated by this analysis. The analysis accounts for a wide range of interactions between tough constructions and other phenomena, which have not been previously focused on in the literature.</description><creator>Ohkado, Kikuyo</creator><contributor>Baker, M.

It will be supported by a comprehensive survey of the associated literature. Specifically, most mainstream interpretations of informal finance adhere to a dualist paradigm that revolves around three key assumptions. First that informal firms are less efficient than formal firms in conducting financial transactions, second that their activities are protected from formal competition due to segmented financial markets, and finally that the economic impact of informal finance is inferior to an overall formal system. Yet much of the qualitative evidence of informal finance contradict these assumptions and limit the validity of dualist interpretations. The dualist conclusion that informal finance is a transitory phenomenon can therefore be derailed, leaving room for a more open ended interpretation of contemporary financial informality.</description><creator>Fischer, Andrew Martin</creator><contributor>Naylor, R.
