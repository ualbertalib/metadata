Netrin-1 is also expressed in the adult CNS, although its function in the adult is  not known. Characterization of netrin-1 in the adult spinal cord indicated that it  is expressed by neurons and oligodendrocytes and that following its secretion,  netrin-1 is associated with membranes and extracellular matrix (ECM). Netrin-1  attracts or repels different cell types in the developing CNS. The repertoire of  netrin receptors expressed exerts a key influence on the response of a cell to  netrin-1. Expression of the netrin receptor DCC, required for an attractive  response, decreased during spinal cord development, resulting in barely detectable  levels in the adult. Conversely, UNC-5 homologues, required for a repellent  response, were expressed in the adult at higher levels than during development.  These findings suggested that in the adult spinal cord netrin-1 may function  predominantly as a short-range cue that inhibits certain forms of  plasticity. The mammalian CNS undergoes a dramatic reduction in regenerative  capacity with maturation. This correlates with the onset of myelination and is due,  in part, to the presence of myelin-associated inhibitors. Subcellular fractionation  of myelin demonstrated that netrin-1 is present in fractions enriched with  periaxonal membranes, suggesting that netrin-1 might be a novel myelin-associated  inhibitor of neurite extension. Our results demonstrated that perturbing netrin  function in specific neuronal subtypes improved neurite outgrowth on myelin  substrates. Furthermore, myelin was found to promote either the expression or the  stability of receptors that mediate a repellent response to netrin-1. The  concentration of cytosolic cAMP decreases with maturation, and the ability of myelin  inhibitors to exert inhibitory effects on axon extension have been shown to be  dependent on reduced levels of cAMP. Furthermore, increasing the levels of cAMP  following injury improves regeneration. The response to netrin-1 is also regulated  by cAMP, with low levels being associated with repulsion and high levels with  attraction. We assessed whether myelin-associated netrin-1 contributes to the  improvement in neurite outgrowth that is observed when the levels of cAMP are  increased, by switching its function from repulsion to attraction. Blocking netrin  function in neurons treated with the membrane permeable cAMP analogue, db-cAMP,  inhibited the growth improving effects normally induced by increasing the levels of  cAMP. These findings support the hypothesis that myelin associated netrin-1 is an  inhibitor of neurite extension that is modulated by the levels of intraneuronal  cAMP, and suggest that netrin-1 inhibits axonal sprouting in the intact CNS and  regeneration following injury.</description><creator>Manitt, Colleen</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Netrin and netrin receptor expression in the adult rat spinal cord : evidence that myelin-associated netrin-1 is an inhibitor of neurite extension</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2n49t241t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nc580n05b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:41687h94h</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:31:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Alcohol abuse and addiction are among the most costly and  prevalent behavioural disorders due to the drug's reinforcing potential and ubiquity  in society. Studies suggest an interaction between alcohol and the endogenous opioid  system: manipulation of endogenous opioid activity affects alcohol intake, and  alcohol administration alters endogenous opioid activity. However, the data are  inconclusive given the discrepancy between pharmacological and genetic knockout  studies on alcohol intake, and the difficulty in interpreting and replicating  findings determined postmortem. There were two major objectives in the present study. First, to  use estradiol valerate to induce selective lesions of endorphinergic perikarya in  adult rats in order to assess its effect on alcohol intake. Voluntary alcohol  consumption was significantly increased in rats treated with estradiol valerate  compared to vehicle, but was not associated with changes in basal levels of anxiety  or hypothalamic beta-endorphin content. Second, to use microdialysis to determine the effect of alcohol  on extracellular levels of opioid peptides and catecholamines in the nucleus  accumbens of awake freely-moving animals. The nucleus accumbens is heavily  implicated in alcohol abuse. Four sets of experiments were conducted: (1) Various  doses of alcohol (0.0-2.4 g ethanol/kg body weight) were tested on beta-endorphin  and catecholamine release in the nucleus accumbens. Only the 2.4 g/kg dose  significantly increased levels of dopamine and beta-endorphin. (2) The release of  beta-endorphin was assessed in response to stress and alcohol in the nucleus  accumbens and hypothalamus. The results showed a different profile for both stimuli:  stressors had an immediate effect in the hypothalamus, while alcohol had a latent  effect in the nucleus accumbens. (3 &amp; 4) Various doses of alcohol (0.0-3.2 g  ethanol/kg body weight) were assessed on extracellular levels of Met-enkephalin and  dynorphin A in the nucleus accumbens. While the 1.6 g/kg dose induced the greatest  release of Met-enkephalin, the 3.2 g/kg dose induced the greatest release of  dynorphin. In conclusion, although estradiol valerate affected alcohol  preference, the results did not support the involvement of beta-endorphin. On the  other hand, opioid peptides are differentially released in the nucleus accumbens in  response to alcohol. The findings lend support to the hypothesis that endogenous  opioids mediate some of the effects of alcohol.</description><creator>Marinelli, Peter W.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Health Sciences, Toxicology.</subject><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>The interaction of alcohol with endogenous opioid peptides in the rat brain /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bc386j677.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/41687h94h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8s45q941p</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:31:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Clathrin-mediated membrane budding mainly occurs at the cell  surface, where it drives the formation of endocytic vesicles necessary for the  internalization of membrane proteins, and at the trans-Golgi network (TGN), where it  mediates the trafficking of cargo proteins from the TGN to the endosomal/lysosomal  system. The general objective of my doctoral research was to study adaptor and  accessory proteins that play structural and regulatory roles in the formation of  clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). This was achieved principally through the  characterization of two protein complexes: a first, which functions at the cell  surface and a second, which regulates vesicle formation at the  TGN/endosome. First, we discovered that the endocytic protein PACSIN 1 is a  binding partner for the signaling molecule mSos1. Further analysis of this  interaction revealed that both proteins form a complex in vivo, that they  co-localize at actin-rich sites, and that their interaction is regulated by  phosphorylation. These data strengthen the link between endocytosis, signaling and  actin cytoskeleton dynamics and provide the basis for further investigation of the  role of this protein complex. Second, we used subcellular proteomics to identify novel  components of brain-derived CCVs. Among these was an ENTH domain-containing protein,  which we named enthoprotin. Further work demonstrated that enthoprotin localizes to  CCVs, interacts with clathrin adaptors AP-1 and GGA2 at the TGN, and stimulates  clathrin assembly in vitro. Altogether, our data suggest a role for enthoprotin in  clathrin coat assembly on internal membranes. Analysis of the enthoprotin protein  sequence led to the discovery of two peptide motifs responsible for interactions  with AP-1 and GGA2. We used alanine-scan mutagenesis and nuclear magnetic resonance  to biochemically and structurally characterize the high-affinity site responsible  for the interaction between enthoprotin and the TGN adaptors. This experimental  approach, coupled to alignments, allowed us to deduce an AP-1/GGA-binding consensus  motif that can be used towards the identification of novel TGN adaptor-binding  partners. Altogether, my doctoral research contributed to furthering knowledge of  the mechanisms that underlie clathrin-mediated membrane budding.</description><creator>Wasiak, Sylwia</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>Characterization of protein-protein interactions involved in clathrin-mediated budding at the plasma membrane and the trans-Golgi network</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gh93gz975.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8s45q941p</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2v23vt83f</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:31:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The development of the hematopoietic system occurs in two waves:  a first wave of primitive erythropoiesis, which consists in the production of a  single lineage, primitive erythrocytes, and a second wave of definitive  hematopoiesis, which describes the generation of many specialized blood cell types  from common hematopoietic stem cells. Whereas definitive hematopoiesis is fairly  well understood, involves signals from the environment and the expression of  lineage-specific transcription factors, the molecular mechanisms regulating  primitive erythropoiesis remain to be defined. The aim of this thesis was to clarify  the roles of the Stem Cell Leukemia (SCL) gene and Vascular Endothelial Growth  Factor (VEGF) during primitive and definitive hematopoiesis. Although gene targeting  experiments indicate essential roles for VEGF/Flk-1 signaling and SCL at the onset  of hematopoiesis, their exact functions remain elusive. This work has revealed that  different thresholds of VEGF are required for the migration of hematopoietic  precursors from mesoderm to sites of hematopoiesis and for their subsequent  expansion. Furthermore, it shows that SCL, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription  factor, acts downstream of VEGF signaling to ensure the survival of primitive  erythrocytes. During definitive hematopoiesis, conditional knock-out experiments  establish a non-redundant role for SCL during erythroid and megakaryocytic  differentiation. Yet, it remains unclear whether SCL is essential for commitment to  these lineages. Results presented in this thesis suggest that SCL is not involved in  commitment to these pathways, but rather acts to consolidate and expand the  erythroid and megakaryocytic compartments, following lineage choice. Finally,  despite the central role for SCL during hematopoietic development, the mechanisms  regulating its tissue specific expression remain unknown. This work provides  molecular and functional evidence that demonstrate that the homeodomain- Taken together, this work has elucidated molecular mechanisms  which underlie cell fate decisions. It describes how the activity of a master  regulator of erythroid differentiation, SCL, is regulated both by signals from the  environment and at the transcriptional level, through combinatorial interactions  between lineage-specific transcription factors.</description><creator>Martin, Richard</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><title>Regulation of SCL expression and function in hematopoiesis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q237hs38d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2v23vt83f</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2227mq16q</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:31:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this dissertation, the phonetic production and perception  abilities of simultaneous bilinguals exposed to both Canadian English (CE) and  French (CF) from birth were tested to determine whether their abilities in the two  languages are best described as autonomous or interdependent. For this purpose, the  similarities and differences in production and perception of coronal stops, /d/ and  /t/, in CE and CF by monolinguals and simultaneous bilinguals were investigated in  three studies. Coronal stops in CE and CF are thought to differ subtly in place  of articulation; CE coronal stops are transcribed as having an alveolar place of  articulation whereas CF coronal stops are transcribed as having a dental place of  articulation. In Study 1, the acoustics of coronal stops produced in isolated words  in CE and CF by monolingual CE and CF speakers were analysed. Because there were no  previous reports of acoustic characteristics of coronal stops in CE and CF, data  from this study provide the foundation for comparisons of monolinguals and  bilinguals in Studies 2 and 3. Results from Study 1 established that bursts  associated with CE and CF stops differ in relative burst intensity and in burst  spectral measures. In Study 2, acoustics of coronal stops embedded in sentences in  CE and CF produced by simultaneous bilinguals and monolinguals was compared. Results  indicated that production of CE and CF coronal stops by simultaneous bilinguals and  monolinguals differs in that simultaneous bilinguals only used a subset of cues  observed in cross-language comparison of monolingual productions. Finally, in Study 3, the discrimination of /dV/ syllables in CE  and CF was compared across simultaneous bilinguals, monolingual CE speakers,  monolingual CF speakers and early L2 learners of French. The simultaneous bilinguals  were significantly better than monolingual CF speakers and early L2 learners of  French. They were also better than the monolingual CE speakers, but only on one out  of the two vowel contexts on which they were tested. Although there are similarities  in the production and perception abilities of simultaneous bilinguals and  monolingual speakers, the differences between them support an interdependent  relationship between the two languages of bilinguals.</description><creator>Sundara, Megha</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Psychology, Developmental.</subject><subject>Language, Linguistics.</subject><title>Phonetic perception and production of coronal stops by adults exposed to two languages from birth</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nz806023r.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2227mq16q</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Communication Sciences and Disorders</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:br86b399h</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:31:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Apoptosis is a genetically programmed highly regulated form of  cellular suicide that plays an essential role in the development and tissue  homeostasis of multicellular organisms. As a variety of pathological states such as  cancer, autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases can be ascribed to the  deregulation of the apoptotic program, understanding the molecular mechanisms  underlying this process is a necessary first step to therapeutic intervention. The  BCL-2 family of proteins is of paramount importance in the regulation of apoptosis  through their control of caspases, a family of cysteine proteases responsible for  cellular demolition. The p53 tumour suppressor protein is a transcription factor  that eliminates potentially dangerous cells via activation of the apoptotic program  through the regulation of various genes, including those of the BCL-2 family. I  found that BIK, a member of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only class of BCL-2 homologues, is  upregulated by p53. Unlike all other BH3-only proteins however, BIK was found to be  uniquely localized to membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum. BIK was induced in  response to several stress stimuli, including genotoxic stress (radiation;  doxorubicin) and over-expression of E1A or p53, but not by ER stress pathways  resulting from protein misfolding. Using siRNA technology, I showed that BIK plays a  critical role in p53-induced cell death by acting at the ER to trigger Ca2+ release,  mitochondrial fission, BAX/BAK activation, cytochrome c release, caspase activation  and apoptosis. BIK also stimulated the (BCL-2 inhibited) accumulation and  oligomerization of BAK at ER membranes. Cells doubly deficient of both BAX and BAK  were resistant to ER Ca2+ release and apoptosis by ectopic expression of both BIK  and p20BAP31, suggesting that these multidomain pro-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins may  serve as a common checkpoint at the ER for varying modes of stress stimuli. Thus,  p53 appears to employ BIK as part of its apopto</description><creator>Mathai, Jaigi P.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>The role of endoplasmic reticulum BIK in p53-mediated apoptosis /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6108vb78n.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/br86b399h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0k225b52b</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:31:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>At first glance, the long tradition of Quebecois adaptations of  Shakespeare might seem paradoxical, since Quebec is a francophone nation seeking  political independence and has little direct connection to the British literary  canon. However, it is precisely this cultural distance that allows Quebecois  playwrights to play irreverently with Shakespeare and use his texts to explore  issues of nation and gender which are closely connected to each other. Soon after  the Quiet Revolution, adaptations such as Robert Gurik's Hamlet, prince du Quebec  and Jean-Claude Germain's Rodeo et Juliette raised the question "To be or not  to be free" in order to interrogate how Quebec could take action to achieve  independence. In Macbeth and La tempete, Michel Garneau "tradapts"  Shakespeare and situates his texts in the context of the Conquest. Jean-Pierre  Ronfard's Lear and Vie et mort du Roi Boiteux carnivalize the nation and permit  women to rise to power. Adaptations since 1990 reveal awareness of the need for  cultural and gender diversity so that women, queers, and immigrants may contribute  more to the nation's development. Since Quebec is simultaneously colonial,  neo-colonial, and postcolonial, Quebecois playwrights negotiate differently than  English Canadians the fine line between the enrichment of their local culture and  its possible contamination, assimilation, or effacement by Shakespeare's  overwhelming influence, which thus allows them to appropriate his texts in service  of gender issues and the decolonization of the Quebec nation.</description><creator>Drouin, Jennifer</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Shakespeare, William, 1564-1616 -- Adaptations</subject><subject>Nationalism -- Québec (Province)</subject><subject>Women -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>French-Canadian drama -- 20th century -- History and criticism.</subject><subject>French-Canadian drama -- Québec (Province) -- History and criticism.</subject><title>"To be or not to be free" : nation and gender in Québécois adaptations of Shakespeare</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k643b1720.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0k225b52b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2801pg691</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:31:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A combined ultra-high vacuum scanning tunneling microscope,  atomic force microscope, and field ion microscope UHV (STM/AFM/FIM) system was used  to study mechanical and electronic interactions at the atomic scale. A surface  science system, consisting of an Auger electron spectrometer, UHV evaporators, ion  sputter gun and annealing capabilities, was designed and constructed. A new force  sensor preparation method was developed suitable for high stability imaging. Using  this improved system, we studied W tip- Au(111) sample interactions in the regimes  from weak coupling to strong interaction and simultaneously measured current changes  from pA to muA. Close correlation between conductance and interaction forces in a  STM configuration was observed. In particular, the electrical and mechanical points  of contact were determined based on the simultaneously observed mechanical and  electrical response. These points of contact as defined by force and current  measurements coincide within measurement error. Ab initio calculations of the  current and force as a function of distance in the tunneling regime are in  quantitative agreement with experimental results. Simultaneous force-distance and  current-distance curves are proven to be essential in understanding processes  occurring in scanning tunneling and force microscopies.

Guided by the  research literature on sexual harassment and a feminist framework, the study seeks  to understand how sexual harassment and its subtleties are experienced by trainee  teachers in Ghana. It particularly throws light on the coping strategies of these  trainee teachers in different sexual harassment scenarios. The study also seeks to  increase awareness of sexual harassment in the Teacher Training Institutions and the  population at large. This study is also a contribution to the scanty literature in  the area of sexual harassment in Africa and has recommended options available to  enlighten educational and policy planners on areas of priorities for action and to  ensure a more effective response to sexual harassment in the Ghanaian  society. Extensive review of the pertinent literature on sexual  harassment was undertaken to support a critical analysis of the expressed  perceptions and experiences of these students. Methods such as focus group  discussions were employed with semi-structured interviews (open-ended questions) and  memory writing as qualitative data gathering techniques to conduct group interviews  and individual sessions with a random sample of 40 participants from two teacher  training institutions of the country, the University College of Education in Winneba  and Bagabaga Training College in Tamale. Female participants were engaged  individually in memory writing using procedural guidelines. The study found out that the main factors predisposing trainee  teachers to sexual harassment in Ghanaian Teacher Training Institutions are  Institutional practices by both teachers and students and the Institutional  environment created from inadequate or complete absence of physical structures aimed  at preventing sexual harassment and assaults. The lack of explicit policies to check  sexual abuse, including sexual harassment, work in concert with the aforementioned  institutional characteristics to create conditions that facilitate sexual harassment  of female trainee teachers in the Ghanaian context. All these accumulate into an  apparent institutional framework of sexual harassment that supports a regime of  blatant disregard of the safety concerns of female trainee teachers. Based on the testimonies of the students, it would appear that  the problem of sexual harassment perpetrated by people in positions of authority is  widespread in Ghana. Female student teachers are regularly exposed to a range of  sexually motivated abuses within the learning environment, and these abuses are  often carried out by tutors, professors, administrative staff and senior students.  These three categories of agents of sexual harassment take advantage of available or  perceived institutional power to abuse vulnerable female students. Also,  perpetrators of sexual harassment against female students are not held accountable  for their acts, thus perpetuating these abuses. By their very nature, the  institutions of learning in Ghana are very hierarchically structured, such that  power, might and right are often easily accorded to tutors over students,  administrative staff over students and senior students over their junior  counterparts. Most often they abuse the power and influence of their positions with  threats of reprisals when the females refuse to consent to their sexual demands. The  victimized females suffer untold consequences, which are minimized at every step in  this structured power system.</description><creator>Atinga, Gladys Teni</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Student teachers -- Ghana</subject><subject>Sexual harassment -- Ghana</subject><subject>Teachers -- Training of -- Ghana</subject><title>Beginning teachers' perceptions and experiences of sexual harassment in Ghanaian teacher training institutions</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m900nv10x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qj72p766t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Integrated Studies in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:df65v839s</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:31:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The El Mochito mine, located in west-central Honduras, exploits  a distal Zn-Pb-Ag skarn-hosted deposit.

Ore minerals, which  post-dated silicate precipitation, comprise sphalerite of variable Fe content,  galena, magnetite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, pyrite and trace amounts of  arsenopyrite. The distribution of ore metals in the orebodies is zoned from  Zn-Fe-rich cores to adjacent Pb- and Ag-rich zones reflecting the sequential  saturation of sphalerite and galena in the fluid with decreasing  temperature. Skarn formation was accompanied by significant additions of Si,  Fe, Mg, Al, and Mn and variable changes in Ca during early alteration. Apparent  decreases in the concentrations of Ti and Zr suggest that the fluid:rock ratio was  high. Variations in component activities of the hydrothermal fluid indicate that  andraditic garnet skarn was stable at lower log(aCa2+/aH+ 2), log(aAl3+/aH+3), and  log aSiO2aq , and higher log(aFe3+/aH+3) than its grossularitic garnet skarn  precursor, whereas hedenbergitic pyroxene skarn was stable at lower log(aCa2+/aH+2)  and log(aFe3+/aH+3) and higher log aSiO2aq than its andraditic skarn  precursor. delta34S values of sphalerite, galena and pyrrhotite cluster  between -1 and +2‰, and their corresponding fluid delta 34 SH2S values  ranged from -3.7 to +5.4‰, indicating that the sulphur was primarily  igneous in origin, and lead isotope ratios of galena are similar to those of the  Miocene-Pliocene Padre Miguel ignimbrite. Variation in the delta 34S values of  sphalerite and the whole-rock Pb isotope ratios of the host limestone are  interpreted to reflect decreasing alteration toward the southwest. Microthermometric measurements for garnet-, pyroxene- and  sphalerite-hosted fluid inclusions indicate that two end-member fluids, a saline  formational brine and a Fe-rich orthomagmatic fluid, formed skarn and ore at the  deposit. The first, hosted by grossularitic garnet and low-Fe sphalerite, is  characterized by homogenization temperatures ranging from 260 to 390°C, and  salinities from 7 to 45 wt.% NaCl equivalent. The second, hosted by pyroxene,  andraditic garnet, and medium-Fe sphalerite, is characterized by a higher  homogenization temperature (320 to 400°C), lower salinity (1 to 15 wt.% NaCl  equivalent) and an elevated Fe concentration.

Under  contemporary climate and environmental change, including enhanced nutrient  deposition through industrialization and commercial peat harvesting, the microbial  environment in peat is altered. Microorganisms are responsible for the net  production of greenhouse gases in these sites, although controls on microbial  activity and microbial communities are poorly understood, limiting our ability to  predict greenhouse gas emissions. The objective of this thesis was to determine the  microbial role in peat decomposition and greenhouse gas fluxes in northern  peatlands. Nutrient, carbon (C) substrate, and microbial-ecological controls on  microbial activity under natural climate variability, increased nutrient deposition,  and commercial harvesting and restoration were explored in detail. Environmental  change effects were evaluated in relation to processes and temporal variability in  pristine sites. The natural temporal variability of decomposition, microbial  biomass, and nitrogen (N) was characterized in the Mer Bleue bog near Ottawa, ON  over two years. In a warmer, drier year, lower water table position corresponded to  increased N availability, which was in turn linked to enhanced microbial CO2  production, consistent with patterns in ecosystem respiration measured at the site  level. It was shown that microbial activity can play an important role in  inter-annual climate driven ecosystem respiration and net ecosystem CO2  exchange. Through field and laboratory nutrient fertilization experiments,  it was shown that increased nitrogen (N) deposition altered the heterotrophic  microbial community at Met Bleue and led to decreased decomposition rates after one  year, despite increased total microbial biomass. After the second year of  fertilization, however, decomposition rates were elevated, presumably a result of a  concomitant shift in moss species and supply of more bioavailable plant material.  Comparison of fertilizations in the presence and absence of vegetation indicated  that in oligotrophic sites, vegetation mediated elevated nutrient effects on  decomposition and that N cycling occurred largely in the organic  forms. Aerobic and anaerobic microbial activity, peat organic and  nutrient chemistry, microbial biomass, and methanogen, CH4-oxidizing bacteria,  bacteria, and archaea were characterized in two sets of pristine, actively  harvested, harvested and abandoned, and harvested and restored peatlands in Quebec  and New Brunswick.</description><creator>Basiliko, Nathan</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Peatlands -- Canada, Eastern</subject><subject>Microbial ecology -- Canada, Eastern</subject><subject>Peat -- Biodegradation -- Canada, Eastern</subject><title>Nutrient, substrate, and microbial-ecological links to decomposition and greenhouse gas production in northern peatlands</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gf06g320q.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hd76s068h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:js956g30d</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:31:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The luminescence properties of trans-dioxo rhenium(V) and  osmium(VI) [d2] and square-planar platinum(II) and palladium(II) [d8] transition  metal complexes have been studied as a function of temperature and pressure. Both  types of complexes studied have idealized D4h point group symmetry with the d2  systems representing the tetragonally compressed limit of a six-coordinate complex  in the D4h point group and the d8 systems representing the tetragonally elongated  limit. The observed luminescence in both classes of complexes has been assigned as a  metal-centered (d → d) 3Eg → 1A1g transition. The application of  external pressure provides a means to induce minor changes in the molecular  geometries of these model systems that reveal the delicate interplay between  structural and electronic properties. Pressure-dependent spectroscopic data are  analyzed quantitatively using theoretical models adapted from high-resolution  low-temperature spectra where emitting state displacements along vibrational  coordinates are determined from resolved vibronic structure. These combined  experimental and theoretical techniques allow for a full characterization of the  ground and emitting state potential energy surfaces and their explicit dependence on  structural parameters. trans-Dioxo rhenium(V) and osmium(VI) complexes have formal  metal-oxo double bonds and the electronic structures of these tetragonal systems are  also influenced by the ancillary ligands bonded to the trans-[MO2]n+ moiety. A  series of trans-[ReO2]+ complexes with substituted N,N,N',N'-ethylenediamine ligands  were studied that show markedly varying luminescence energies and bandshape  characteristics. Pressure-dependent luminescence spectra at room temperature show  resolved structure in the high-frequency (~900 cm-1) O = Re = O symmetric  (a1g ) stretching mode. Variable pressure causes the vibronic patterns to change and  a detailed analysis is performed using potential energy surfaces from a coupled  states model with the time-dependent theory of spectroscopy. Additional work was  carried out on trans-dioxo osmium(VI) complexes with monodentate isothiocyanate  ligands that show highly resolved vibronic structure at low temperature in both  metal-ligand and ligand-centered a1g vibrational modes, allowing for a detailed  analysis of the emitting state geometries. Temperature- and pressure-dependent spectroscopic studies of  thiocyanate and selenocyanate complexes of platinum(II) and palladium(II) revealed  significant variations of luminescence intensities and lifetimes.

This  problem is important in the context of interception of future maneuverable ballistic  missiles. However, the theoretical developments are expected to find application to  a broad class of hybrid control and estimation problems in industry. The validity of  the results is nevertheless confirmed using a benchmark problem in the area of  terminal guidance. A specific interception scenario between an incoming target with  no information and a single interceptor missile with noisy measurements is analyzed  in the form of a linear hybrid system subject to additive abrupt  changes. The general research is aimed to achieve improved homing  accuracy by integrating ideas from detection theory, state estimation theory and  guidance. The results achieved can be summarized as follows. (i) Two novel maneuver  detectors are developed to diagnose abrupt changes in a class of hybrid systems  (detection and isolation of evasive maneuvers): a new implementation of the GLR  detector and the novel adaptive- H0 GLR detector. (ii) Two novel state estimators  for target tracking are derived using the novel maneuver detectors. The state  estimators employ parameterized family of functions to described possible evasive  maneuvers. (iii) A novel adaptive Bayesian multiple model predictor of the ballistic  miss is developed which employs semi-Markov models and ideas from detection theory.  (iv) A novel integrated estimation and guidance scheme that significantly improves  the homing accuracy is also presented. The integrated scheme employs banks of  estimators and guidance laws, a maneuver detector, and an on-line governor; the  scheme is adaptive with respect to the uncertainty affecting the probability density  function of the filtered state. (v) A novel discretization technique for the family  of continuous-time, game theoretic, bang-bang guidance laws is introduced. The  performance of the novel algorithms is assessed for the scenario of a  pursuit-evasion engagement between a randomly maneuvering ballistic missile and an  interceptor. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations are employed to evaluate the main  statistical properties of the algorithms.

Among the cellular factors are lysyl-tRNA  synthetase (LysRS) and tRNALys3, the primer tRNA for reverse transcription. LysRS is  a tRNALys-binding protein, and is the enzyme that aminoacylates tRNALys. It is  therefore a likely candidate for the signal which targets tRNALys for packaging into  HIV-1. Gag alone among the viral proteins is sufficient to package LysRS, but the  additional presence of GagPol is required for tRNALys incorporation as well. We  propose that the tRNALys packaging complex includes Gag, GagPol, viral genomic RNA,  tRNALys, and LysRS. To study the formation of this complex, we have investigated the  following: (1) How does RNA facilitate the interaction between Gag and GagPol? (2)  What are the kinetics of assembly of Gag/GagPol complexes in HIV-1? (3) How specific  is the interaction of Gag with LysRS? (4) Which cellular pools of LysRS are required  for the incorporation of LysRS into virions? Membrane and RNA have been proposed to act as intracellular  scaffolds for aligning Gag molecules and facilitating their interaction with each  other. In this thesis, we have examined both the RNA requirement for Gag/GagPol  interaction and the membrane site at which this interaction can first be seen. Using  both RNAse in vitro and mutations within the nucleocapsid region in either Gag or  GagPol in vivo, we have concluded that the interaction of GagPol with Gag required  an RNA-facilitated Gag multimerization, but that a direct interaction of GagPol with  RNA is not required. We have also found that at steady-state, almost all Gag/Gag and  Gag/GagPol complexes are found at detergent-resistant membrane (DRM). Analysis of  the localization of newly-synthesized Gag/Gag and Gag/GagPol complexes indicates  that after a 10 minute pulse with radioactive 35S-Cys/Met, all newly-synthesized  Gag/GagPol is found at the DRM. Only 30% of newly synthesized Gag/Gag complexes move  to the membrane, of which 38% is found associated with DRM at 0 minute chase. The  remaining membrane-bound Gag associates with DRM after a 30 minute chase. The rapid  localization of GagPol to DRM probably reflects the interaction of all  newly-synthesized GagPol with the first new-synthesized polymeric Gag to associate  with DRM.</description><creator>Halwani, Rabih</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Biology, Microbiology.</subject><title>Interactions between Gag, GagPol, and Lysyl-tRNA synthetase during HIV-1 assembly</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8336h244p.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6q182k584</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8w32r6116</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:31:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a ubiquitously  expressed enzyme that is involved in multiple signaling pathways. Biochemical and  substrate trapping studies have implicated PTP1B in the dephosphorylation of various  tyrosine kinases, including the EGFR, PDGFR, IR, IGF-IR, JAK2, p210Bcr-Abl, and Src.  Of particular interest, gene-targeting studies in mice have established PTP1B as a  critical physiological regulator of metabolism by attenuating insulin and leptin  signaling. Indeed, PTP1B null mice exhibit resistance to diet-induced diabetes and  obesity. Although PTP1B is involved in signaling pathways that contribute to  oncogenesis, PTP1B null mice do not develop spontaneous tumors. Therefore, my  doctoral research focuses on identifying the physiological significance of PTP1B in  these pathways. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that PTP1B modulates  leptin signaling via the tyrosine kinase JAK2. Accordingly, I have shown that PTP1B  dephosphorylates JAK2 in a growth hormone (GH)-dependent manner, thus negatively  regulating GH signaling and downstream effectors such as STAT3 and STAT5.  Consequently, mice lacking PTP1B remain sensitive to GH action after starvation. In  addition, I showed that the absence of PTP1B could improve glycemia during  streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetes. In the second part of my research, I have  elucidated the mechanism for the previously reported decreased ERK activation in  PTP1B null fibroblasts. I demonstrated that Ras activity is reduced in these cells,  which is due to increased p120RasGAP expression and p62Dok hyperphosphorylation.  Both of these molecules negatively regulate Ras activity by promoting the intrinsic  GTPase activity of Ras, leading to decreased ERK activation. Finally, I developed a  mouse model of cancer to study the role of PTP1B in tumorigenesis. Since the  majority of cancers harbor mutations in p53, I generated p53/PTP1B double null mice.

Language lateralization  was determined via the intracarotid Sodium Amytal procedure in epilepsy patients. In  study 1, three groups of patients were investigated: a left speech group (LSG); a  right speech group (RSG); and a bilateral speech group (BSG). Two auditory cortex  regions: Heschl's gyrus (HG) and the planum temporale (PT) were labelled on the  magnetic resonance imaging scan of each subject. Additionally, an automatic  voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis was performed. The overall findings suggested  that the structural asymmetries found in the auditory regions did not clearly and  directly relate to language lateralization. The VBM analysis, however, revealed a  grey matter concentration difference in the region of Broca's area favoring the left  hemisphere (LH) in the LSG, and the right hemisphere (RH) in the RSG. That  structural difference did relate to language lateralization and was further  investigated in studies 2 and 3. Previously collected positron emission tomography  data were examined in these two studies. Three regions of interest (ROI) analyses  and one group average analysis were performed. Activation related to various speech  tasks was examined. The ROI analyses revealed a significant activation difference  favoring the LH for two targeted speech-task subtractions but only for the LSG. The  group analysis, in contrast, revealed that the LSG showed a functional asymmetry  favoring the LH, and that the RSG showed a functional asymmetry favoring the RH.  Overall, the present results provided only partial evidence for a relationship  existing between structural asymmetry in Broca's area and language lateralization.

However, for the first time with Penetration  (1993-1994) the artist investigates the inside of the body. Anatomically descriptive and strangely symbolical the components  of this hanging composition make up a huge portrait of the elements with which we  are composed. With this thesis, I will demonstrate what is revealed is the body's  structure: its content, its secrets, what is on the other side of the physical  border and what soaks the flesh, the forces that bring us alive. In addition, although the composition suggests a  three-dimensional anatomical model, I will reveal it remains a distinctly visual and  cerebral experience: a conceptualization of the body rather than the body's itself.  Penetration stands for a view of ourselves that we know not from any real  familiarity but from visual diagrams that have been derived from scientific research  and consensus since, its separate elements and colors are taken from medical  illustration. Using artistic and historic examples, I will establish that even  though the human body proposed by Messager is based on the anatomical model it is  not a flattened representation reduced to an erudite enumeration but rather a  three-dimensional model which can be experienced from within. Messager stages the possibility of a face-to-face with the  spectator. Inside Penetration the body recalls the very body materiality, a body  where "dead" dangling internal organs "come to life" via the  viewers' participation, via their penetration. The relationship of scale is upset  and the spectators are invited to penetrate inside the body: to see things from  up-close, to feel its elements, to touch its parts. With Penetration Messager confronts the spectators with an  intimate act as she directs them under (or rather) inside somebody's skin and forces  them to confront their own sense of embodiment. Messager honours the physical body  as our primary means of experiencing the world. I will ascertain that with her  specific treatment of the body and without having to rely on modern technology, the  artist offers an inquiry into the body as well as questions notions of embodiment.  In other words, I will demonstrate Penetration exemplifies a complex set of  negotiations between body and space: negotiations between the actual domain of the  real body of the viewer and the three-dimensional (virtual) domain of the  represented body and represented spaces. In conclusion, I will propose that via the sense of touch  Annette Messager produces a body where there is no escape between objective seeing  and subjective feeling and where the human experience is formed and  transformed.</description><creator>Kadyss, Sabine</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Anatomy, Artistic</subject><subject>Messager, Annette, 1943- Penetration</subject><subject>Installations (Art)</subject><title>Annette Messager's Penetration : from having a body to being a body</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z890rt86s.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bz60cw77s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q811kk09f</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:31:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Lactate is a key metabolite of glycolytic activity and as such,  can be used as an indicator of the energy production of the whole organism, for the  assessment of tissue perfusion and oxidative capacity. Estimating lactate levels in  biological fluids allows the determination of anaerobic threshold during physical  exercise. Likewise, lactate is of significant importance in several clinical  situations, where a rapid and easy method is needed for diagnostic assessment and  survival rate increase of the patient. To achieve this objective, the potential of Near Infrared  Spectroscopy (NIRS) to quantify lactate in biological fluids and tissues was  evaluated. Initially, the project focused on quantifying of lactate in plasma  samples taken from exercising humans. Using Partial Least Squares (PLS) and a  leave-N-out cross validation routine, it was found that lactate concentration in  human plasma could be estimated with a standard error of cross validation of 0.51  mmol/L. To minimize sample preparation and reduce the time of analysis,  NIRS was then evaluated as a technique for rapid analysis of lactate in whole blood  from exercising rats and humans. Furthermore, standard addition method was used to  expand the lactate concentration range and therefore cover a greater part of the  physiological lactate concentration range. Regression analysis provided standard  errors of cross validation of 0.29 mmol/L and 0.65 mmol/L for rats and humans  respectively. To improve precision, referenced lactate measurements were  calculated. In this method, baseline spectra of subjects were subtracted from all  collected spectra before chemometric routines were used. An improvement of the  standard error of cross validation to 0.21 mmol/L was found by applying this  procedure. In vivo measurement of lactate during exercise in humans by NIRS  was also evaluated. Using diffuse reflectance and 2D correlation spectroscopy,  lactate was identified as the primary constituent monitored by in vivo measurements.  Regression analysis resulted in a substantial error of 2.21 mmol/L for absolute  measurements. However, results for referenced lactate measurements provided a  significant improvement of the standard error of cross validation to 0.76 mmol/L.  This finding suggests that NIRS may provide a valuable tool to assess in vivo  physiological status for both research and clinical needs.</description><creator>Lafrance, Denis, 1965-</creator><contributor>Burns, David H.

By expanding the definition of power, and its  horizons, beyond the state or organized institutions, he has bestowed power upon the  weak as well as the strong, reconceptualized it from a one-dimensional, to an  all-pervasive entity. This thesis has adopted this expansive view of power and applied  it to a study of the religious life within the Congregation de Notre-Dame of  Montreal between 1693 and 1796. On a general level, the study, working within the  framework of other research that has attempted to broaden the perception of female  religious institutions, firmly links the congregation to the cultural, spiritual,  political and economic life of its surrounding society. More precisely, it  establishes the Congregation de Notre-Dame, within the Canadian historical context,  as an institution not primarily founded, developed and centred solely on the work of  one sanctified individual---Marguerite Bourgeoys---but one which, from its  inception, owed its establishment and its existence to the network of linkages it  formed through its mission. On a more specific level, the thesis moves to focus upon  the relationship of power to the religious life in terms of three individual convent  superiors---Marie Barbier, Marie-Josephe Maugue-Garreau and Marie Raizenne---and it  explores these women as agents within their own social, political and spiritual  frameworks. In the process of this entire examination, this thesis set out  to widen the perspective of much research surrounding the religious life. It has  endeavoured to view the religious existence outside of the traditional dichotomies  separating its active and contemplative dimensions, and to explore and give  integrity and empowerment to its entirety. The study has also attempted to avoid  depicting the existence of these women in terms of binary oppositions, of oppressed  vs. the oppressor, and endeavoured to analyze them in terms of exchange. However, in  spite of substantial evidence establishing these women as agents in their own right,  the thesis inevitably returned, in one form or another, to the conclusion that, in  the end, theirs was, indeed, a fragile authority.</description><creator>Gray, Colleen Allyn</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Monasticism and religious orders for women -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- History</subject><subject>Congrégation de Notre-Dame -- History</subject><subject>Nuns -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- History</subject><title>A fragile authority : power and the religious life in the Congrégation de Notre-Dame of Montreal, 1693-1796</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/12579s73g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1v53jx532</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0z708w967</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:31:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In order to design the metal delivery system for the single belt  caster in the MMPC (McGill Metals Processing Centre) foundry, water modeling and  mathematical modeling were carried out for a newly devised three-chamber type  tundish. Water flow in the acrylic tundish was visualized using dye injection. Flow  velocities were also measured using a Dual Nd-YAG PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry)  system. A commercial FEM code, FEMLAB 2.3 was adopted to predict the velocity field  and temperature profile within the tundish, especially in the output chamber.  Calculated results were validated with the PIV measurements. A full-scale water  model was built for the single belt caster to simulate the casting operation and to  validate the optimized delivery system. Temperature profiles for the tundish wall  were also predicted to choose a suitable method of preheating and to determine  refractory wall specifications. A three-chamber type tundish comprising an entry chamber, a head  control chamber and an output chamber was designed to provide clean metal and strips  of uniform thickness across the width of the belt. An output chamber proved to be  essential for removing the bubbles and for obtaining a uniform film of water on the  substrate by preventing strong hydraulic jump. The output chamber had to be  completely closed for rapid bubble removal. For rapid filling of the output chamber  at start up, the starting stopper proved to be essential. The 3-hole type nozzle,  proved to be more effective for removing the bubbles, was found to have problems in  terms of strongly impinging jet flow and non-uniform lateral  velocities. Using mathematical modeling and full scale water modeling,  including PIV measurements, the "FD" type nozzle, which had a multi  channel flow modifier in the output chamber and a slot type inlet nozzle, was found  to be the best in terms of rapid bubble removal and uniform distribution of flow.  This was achieved by a dramatic reduction in the strength of the vertically  impinging flow towards the belt. However, this "FD" type nozzle generated  a dead zone near the triple point within the output chamber. To remove the dead  zone, a gently sloped shape insulator was inserted between the tundish back wall and  the belt.</description><creator>Moon, Ki-Hyeon</creator><contributor>Guthrie, Rod I. L.

One drawback is  the lack of selectivity which leads to severe side effects and limited efficacy, and  another is the emergence/selection of drug-resistance. To limit non-specific  toxicity and to improve the efficiency of cancer therapy, "tumor markers",  which are proteins generally overexpressed on the surface of tumor cells, can be  selectively targeted. Growth factor receptors are one of the most extensively studied  groups of tumor markers. The implication of growth factor receptors in the  pathogenesis of cancer has clearly been established and therefore, provides a  rationale for therapeutic intervention. The targeting of cytotoxic substances to  defined cell populations with "magic bullets" is an old idea that raised  high expectations but also disappointment. Over the past decade, newly gained  understanding of mechanisms for targeted therapy have brought new hopes.  Pharmacological agents that selectively target and block the action of growth  factors and their receptors have been attempted, such as monoclonal antibodies  (mAbs) (whole molecule or fragments), bispecific antibodies, mAbs conjugated to  drugs, toxins or radioisotopes, small peptidic and peptidomimetic molecules in free  form or conjugated to drugs, anti-sense oligonucleotides,  immunoliposomes-encapsulated drugs, and small molecule inhibitors. We designed,  synthesized and characterized new chemotherapeutic agents consisting of Paclitaxel  or Doxorubicin as anti-cancer drugs chemically coupled to growth factor  receptor-selective monoclonal antibodies or small peptides as targeting agents. We  show that the conjugates were selective and specific towards the targeted receptors,  and had significant increased efficiency compared to parent drugs. More importantly,  the conjugates were able to bypass p-glycoprotein-mediated resistance both in vitro  and in vivo. These findings have considerable importance since drug resistance is a  major cause of cancer treatment failure.</description><creator>Guillemard, Véronique</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Chemistry, Organic.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</subject><subject>Chemistry, Pharmaceutical.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</subject><title>Design and chemical synthesis of selective cancer therapeutics</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q237hs420.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/05741s29h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hd76s071t</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:31:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis shows that series capacitive compensation of  transmission lines by a combination of Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC)  and dielectric capacitors lowers the cost of series compensation. The SSSC has two  functions: (1) to provide some series capacitive reactance compensation; (2) to damp  out incipient unstable Subsynchronous Resonance (SSR) modes. Digital simulation  using HYPERSIM shows that for an overall capacitive depth of compensation of 0.7 pu,  the SSSC component is only about 1/3 of the capacitive Mvar. Based on the transient  stability limit, the transmissibility of the line is increased by a factor of 2.23  for a depth of compensation of 0.7. A second objective of this thesis is to extend the application  of the SSSC concept. This application is found in HVDC, where there is no  synchronizing power. In the family of Voltage-Source Converter (VSC) HVDC, it is  possible to embed the control of the SSSC in the converter station so that there is  enhanced synchronizing power. The effectiveness of the synchronizing power (together  with damping power) is demonstrated through digital simulations of a  turbine-generator system which is connected to a VSC-HVDC Station. The thesis shows that the SSSC has two modes of operation: (1)  the constant reactance mode, in which the SSSC voltage is proportional to the line  current, and (2) the constant quadrature voltage mode, in which the SSSC voltage is  a constant quadrature voltage independent of the line current. A comparison between  the two modes shows that the constant reactance mode provides higher synchronizing  power and has a higher transient stability limit. Eigenvalue analysis and digital simulations are the  methodologies used.</description><creator>AL Jowder, Fawzi A.

Without telomeres, chromosome ends are recognized as  DNA breaks and inclined to nucleolytic degradation and end-to-end fusions. Telomeres  consist of DNA repeats that are synthesized by telomerase, a specialized reverse  transcriptase (RT) enzyme minimally composed of a catalytic protein subunit (TERT)  and an essential RNA component (TR). Although the functional aspects of telomerase  are not well elucidated, this ribonucleoprotein enzyme clearly regulates cellular  life-span through its ability to maintain or elongate telomeres. Human TERT (hTERT)  has a central region containing conserved (RT)-like motifs, and N- and C-terminal  regions that are unique to the TERT family. We analysed the precise role of the  C-terminus of hTERT by introducing small deletions and amino acid substitutions  throughout the C-terminal region, and demonstrated that the hTERT C-terminal region  is essential for enzyme catalysis in vitro. We reported that hTERT multimerization  requires the presence of catalytically essential C-terminal amino acid residues and  intact RT-like motifs on the same hTERT molecule. We also examined DNA synthesis at  nucleotide resolution with a direct primer extension assay, and found that the hTERT  C-terminus modulates telomerase processivity. In addition, we reported that human  telomerase reconstituted in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) and partially purified  telomerase from human cells catalyze the cleavage of DNA substrates prior to their  elongation. Finally, we determined the experimental conditions for human telomerase  expression in insect cells in order to obtain an abundant source of catalytically  active recombinant telomerase.</description><creator>Huard, Sylvain</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Human telomerase determinants of processivity and fidelity</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sq87bv041.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9880vr422</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ws859g14s</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:31:34Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The benefits and influences of parent involvement were examined  among a group of children with learning disabilities (LD). One aim of this study was  to determine whether different types of parent involvement are associated with  educational benefits in special education. A second aim was to apply an existing  model of parent involvement to assess its influences in this population. One hundred  and twenty-three children with and without LD from grades 1 to 8 and their parents  participated in the study. Children's grades and their attitudes to school were used  as educational outcomes to evaluate the impact of their parents' involvement.  Mothers and fathers completed questionnaires regarding their school,  cognitive-intellectual and personal involvement, as well as measures of stress,  social support, and perception of their child's academic ability. Mothers were  consistently more involved than fathers in all types of activities. Higher grades  were significantly correlated with mothers' involvement in school-related activities  and fathers' involvement in personal activities. Fathers who felt they received a  greater amount of social support tended to be more involved in their children's  cognitive and personal activities. Mothers who perceived a greater amount of social  support were more personally involved with their children, and mothers who perceived  their children as having more severe LDs were less personally involved. Overall  results extend the literature on the benefits and the factors associated with parent  involvement for children with LD and highlight the need for parents, educators and  school psychologists to combine resources in order to increase awareness and levels  of parent involvement.</description><creator>Gerstein, Stephanie Hannah</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Learning disabled children.</subject><subject>Education -- Parent participation.</subject><title>Benefits and influences of parent involvement for children with learning disabilities</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cz30pt23b.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ws859g14s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z890rt872</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:31:34Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Children with and without autism were evaluated on two change  detection tasks that entailed responding to 2 side-by-side images that were  displayed on a computer screen. In Experiment 1, a distracter object that remained  unchanged was displayed next to a target object that changed in 1 of 3 ways, a  global position change, a color change, or a local deletion change. The stimuli  consisted of photographs and drawings that were presented at blank intervals of  either 50 or 250 ms. In Experiment 2, color and deletion changes were compared in  photographs of objects and people. Children with autism were expected to demonstrate  enhanced change detection across both experiments, as well as better detection of  local than global changes, and superior processing of changes to objects compared to  people. Across tasks, both groups performed comparably in change detection ability.  Children with autism did not demonstrate enhanced visual detection, and evidenced  similar patterns of visual discrimination compared to typically developing children.  They also exhibited similar processing of changes to objects and people.
