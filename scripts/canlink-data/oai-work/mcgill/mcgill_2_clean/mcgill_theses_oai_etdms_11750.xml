An approximate theoretical analysis is presented for multiply-scattered gamma-rays for a point source and an extended source* Previous theoretical predictions on the relationship between the roentgen and absolute energy units have been confirmed experimentally for the gamma-rays from Co60.

The total amino nitrogen content showed a corresponding maximum on the fourth day, suggesting that carbon dioxide assimilation and amino nitrogen formation were linked. Added glutamate supported normal growth in the absence of carbon dioxide, effecting at least a partial substitution for the assimilated gas. Preliminary studies indicated that a pentose-like substance was synthesized during cellulose decomposition and that a fluorescing substance other than riboflavin was produced.</description><creator>Stranks, Donald Winfield.</creator><contributor>McFarlane, W.

Modern theory, while perfectly adequate for all ordinary occasions, shows weaknesses when called on to explain certain pathological conditions, in particular diabetes mellitus. It is true that the present concepts can be twisted and modified to conform to the Procrustean bed of these abnormalities, but the result is not altogether satisfying and there remain one or two hard facts that are resistant to explanation.[...]</description><creator>Stewart, R.D.</creator><contributor>Heard, R.

The lignification study reported was conducted with three grasses, viz, Timothy, Brome and Reed Canary grass, while the digestibility study was conducted with Timothy only. A method of estimating the percentage of lignified area in plant tissue is described and has been used throughout the study. The percentage of lignified area in the stem increased as the plant matured. In Timothy and Brome grass the percentage of lignified area increased as one progressed up the culm. With Reed Canary grass the reverse was true in stages at which rapid growth was taking place. After rapid growth had ceased, the situation was found in Timothy and Brome grass. Feeding trials showed decreasing digestibility with increasing maturity. Study of ttie fecal slides indicated that all undigested plant tissue was lignified. The percentage of lignified area in the stem accounted for approximately 50% of the undigested Dry Matter of the feeding trial.</description><creator>Steppler, Howard A.</creator><contributor>Raymond, L.

The radiations have been investigated by a magnetic beta-spectrometer and by absorption methods. A conversion line is found at an energy of 0.0682 +/- .0011 Mev. and indicates a gamma ray of 0.129 +/- .003 Mev. The beta spectrum is found to be complex as the result of a Kurie plot with apparently three components whose end points are 0.953 +/- .020 Mev., O.526 +/- .020 Mev., and 0.30U +/- .020 Mev. The intensities are, respectively, 74%, 18%, and 8% as Judged by the graphical integration of the areas under the components. The existence of these components and the values of the end points are subject to confirmation by gamma ray and coincidence measurements. As the result of absorption measurements of the gamma rays in lead it is believed that the gamma radiation consists of three components with energies about 0.1 Mev., 0.2 Mev. and 0.8 Mev. respectively.[...]</description><creator>Newsham, Lloyd G.</creator><contributor>Foster, J.

This part of the Appalachians in Canada is, in the main, a continuation of the Green Mountains of Vermont and is known as the Notre Dame Mountains. The System also includes the Sutton and Megantic Mountains. The Topographic Survey of Canada has published contour maps of this region on a scale of one mile to one inch, with a contour interval of twenty-five feet. [...]</description><creator>Stalker, A.

They had noted that, out of a group of about one hundred and twenty-five children whom they were treating, most responded well to treatment but a few responded poorly. All were receiving the same instructions and medications. The physicians believed that there might be social and/or emotional factors which hampered the response to treatment in certain cases. It was for this reason that they consulted the Social Service Department of the hospital in regard to a special review of these cases.
