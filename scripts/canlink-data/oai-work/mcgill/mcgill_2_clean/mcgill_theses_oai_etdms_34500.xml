Telomerase is minimally composed of a protein catalytic subunit, the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), and an RNA subunit. Using a small single-stranded segment (7--11 nucleotides) of the telomerase RNA as a template, the active site of the TERT catalytic subunit adds complementary nucleotides onto telomeric DNA. The primary goal of the work presented in this thesis was to biochemically and functionally characterize the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and the human telomerase RNA (hTR), as well as to identify novel telomerase-associated proteins. First, we demonstrated that the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae possesses the cellular machinery to fully assemble a catalytically active human telomerase RNP in vivo. We also analyzed telomerase activity and binding of hTR to hTERT in rabbit reticulocyte lysates by expressing different hTERT and hTR variants. Our results identified two distinct regions of hTR that can independently bind hTERT in vitro. Furthermore, sequences or structures that include the conserved CR4--CR5 domain of hTR were found to be important for hTERT-hTR interactions and telomerase activity reconstitution. Human TERT carboxy- and amino-terminal amino acid deletions indicated that the polymerase and RNA binding functions of hTERT are separable. We also found that the product of the survival of motor neuron ( SMN) gene, a protein involved in the biogenesis of certain RNPs, is a telomerase-associated protein. Our results demonstrate that the human TR and the human TERT are not associated with Sm proteins, in contrast to Saccharomyces cerevisiae telomerase. Taken together, the work presented in this thesis indicate that the reconstitution of human telomerase activity in vitro requires regions of hTERT that (i) are distinct from the conserved reverse transcriptase</description><creator>Bachand, François</creator><contributor>Autexier, Chantal (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Functional reconstitution and RNA-protein interactions of human telomerase</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k930bz86m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3x816p20k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zp38wf415</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:45:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is the preferred cereal for malting. Its suitability for malting depends on many criteria, including the size, shape and uniformity of the kernels. Malting quality is affected by many quantitative trait loci (QTL). Such loci have been mapped using phenotypic and genotypic information on all members of mapping populations. It may also be possible to detect marker-QTL associations using selective genotyping, in which only the progeny with high or low phenotypic values for a trait are genotyped with available markers. Information on marker-QTL associations may be used in marker-assisted selection. Marker-assisted selection could be particularly useful for barley malting quality traits, some of which are costly to assess. Here, three studies were conducted related to QTL for barley grain and malt quality characteristics. In the first study, QTL were mapped using kernel size and shape data obtained by image analysis on samples from a two-rowed by six-rowed barley cross. QTL were detected near vrs1 on chromosome 2(2H) and near int-c on chromosome 4(4H). Some QTL affected the within-sample variability without affecting the mean of kernel characteristics. QTL alleles that made kernels larger and/or rounder also tended to improve malt quality. Those that increased the variability of kernel size were associated with poor malt quality. In the second study, marker genotype data and grain and malt quality phenotype data from three mapping populations were used to investigate the feasibility of selective genotyping for QTL mapping. Almost all previously mapped QTL were detected often with only 10% of the population genotyped. Additional, possibly spurious, QTL were detected in regions of the genome where no significant QTL had been mapped. The results indicated that simultaneous investigation of two or more traits by selective genotyping could be worthwhile. In the third study, Morex alleles at a QTL on chromosome 7(5H) affecting alpha-amylase activ</description><creator>Ayoub, Micheline</creator><contributor>Mather, D. E.

A non-contact carbon coating was used to avoid the adhesion between Cu(In1-x Gax)3Se5 ingots and the inner ampoule walls. The composition along and across the as grown ingots with different starting Ga contents was analyzed and the results were interpreted by the established pseudobinary phase diagrams. Results of XRD confirmed that the lattice constants of the Cu(In1-xGax)3Se 5 crystals varied linearly with the Ga content. Results of X-ray Laue back-reflection showed that the Cu(In1-xGax) 3Se5 ingots contained large single crystal regions. Hall effect measurements carried out on the grown samples revealed that the Cu(In 1-xGax)3Se5 crystals were highly resistive with rather low carrier concentrations. The morphology of as-grown or cleaved sample surfaces of the Cu(In1-xGax) 3Se5 ingots were also studied under optical microscope and SEM. Metallic Na was, for the first time, introduced into Cu(In1-x Gax)3Se5 compounds to observe the doping effects. The introduction of Na increased the electron concentration significantly for CuIn3Se5 samples (x = 0) but did not show a significant effect on Cu(In1-xGax) 3Se5 samples with x &gt; 0. The increase in electron concentration in the CuIn3Se5 samples after the Na diffusion could be explained by defect generation related to Se and In sites. Crystals of CuInSe2 were also grown by the horizontal Bridgman method for the first time with the addition of metallic sodium. Degradation in crystalline quality and a change of conductivity type from p- to n-type were observed in ingots grown from melts containing more than 0.25 at. % Na. Experiments of Na diffusion were also carried out on CuInSe 2 crystals in a sealed glass ampoule to observe the doping effect. Hot probe measurements indicated that the sodium-treated CuInSe2 samples changed from p-type to n-type. MIS devices were fabricated on the Na-treated CuIn3Se 5 material for electrical characterization. Dark current density-voltage characteristics and differential capacitance-voltage characteristics of the MIS devices were measured at room temperature. An energy band diagram of the MIS devices has been constructed based on the band lineup data reported in the literature. The current transport mechanism was examined and a dominant multi-step tunneling process was proposed. Samples of Cu(In1-xGax)3Se 5 with x ≤ 0.5 were found to be strongly photoconductive over the wavelength range from 700 to 1100 nm even at room temperature. It was observed that the sensitivity of photoconductivity was greatly influenced by surface preparation conditions. Chemically etched samples showed the highest photoconductivity, believed to be due to the reduced surface recombination velocity. Capacitance measurements were carried out to investigate the interface and bulk properties of ZnO/CdS/Cu(In1-xGax)Se 2 solar cells. Results from the steady state C-V measurements showed evidence of interface or surface states, especially for the samples without annealing. DLTS technique was used to determine the deep levels in Cu(In 1-xGax)Se2 crystals with Ga content varying from 0 to 1. Different deep levels for holes with different DLTS spectra were found in the Cu(In1-xGax)Se2 crystals, with different Ga contents. The present results showed that the Ga content has an important effect on the formation of deep levels in Cu(In1-x Gax)Se2 crystals.</description><creator>Wang, Haiping, 1969-</creator><contributor>Shih, I.

Cumulating evidence suggests that this process is mediated by enzymes of the prohormone convertase (PC) family. However, the precise role and mode of action of these PCs in the brain are still poorly understood. To gain further insight in the putative function of PC5A in the processing of neuropeptide precursors in the brain, we examined its regional, cellular and subcellular distribution in rat brain using immunohistochemistry at the light and confocal microscopic levels. PC5A was extensively distributed throughout the rat brain. It was present in selective neuronal population, but not in glia, consistent with a role of this enzyme in the maturation of peptide precursors destined for regulated secretion. At the subcellular level, PC5A was mainly concentrated in the Golgi apparatus and perikaryal vesicles, suggesting an implication of the enzyme early in the neurosecretory pathway. In a second set of studies, the immunohistochemical distribution of neurotensin (NT) and of either PC1, PC2 or PC5A were compared in rat brain sections using single- or double-labelling immunohistochemistry in order to ascertain whether these convertases might play a role in the processing of the NT precursor (pro-NT/NN) in vivo . The proportion of NT immunoreactive neurons co-expressing either one of these PCs was quantified in NT-rich regions. Neurons co-localizing NT and PC2 were the most numerous, with over 60% of NT-immunoreactive cells being also positive for PC2. NT/PC1 and NT/PC5A neurons were less numerous. Furthermore, the distribution of NT neurons co-localizing PC1 was negatively correlated with that of NT neurons expressing PC5A, suggesting that PC1 and PC5A may play interchangeable roles for the processing of pro-NT/NN in mammalian brain.

Many teratogens induce DNA damage in the organogenesis-stage conceptus; the consequences of this insult depend on the extent of the damage and on the ability of the embryo to repair DNA. The hypothesis for this thesis is that DNA repair capacity plays a role in the response of the conceptus to DNA-damaging teratogens. The first objective of this thesis was to elucidate the expression profile of DNA repair pathway genes during mid-organogenesis (gestational days 10--12) in the rat, a period during which the conceptus is most susceptible to the malformations induced by genotoxic teratogens. Four main repair pathways were examined: the nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, mismatch repair, and recombination repair pathways. The genotoxic stress-activated cell cycle checkpoint pathway was also examined. Genes from these pathways showed developmental time-specific alterations in transcript and protein levels, as well as activity. Differences in expression between yolk sac and embryo proper were observed at the transcript, protein, and activity levels. The second goal of this thesis was to determine whether DNA repair machinery expression and activity are modified in the conceptus following exposure to teratogens. Changes in gene transcript, protein, and activity levels were observed following embryo culture with three known teratogens (cyclophosphamide, oxidative stress, methotrexate). While one base excision repair gene increased in expression, the remaining repair genes examined either did not change transcript levels or decreased in expression following teratogen exposure, indicating a near complete inability to induce a DNA repair response following genotoxic stress. These results demonstrate that differential expression and regulation of DNA repair genes and gene products exist in the mid-organogenesis stage rat conceptus, and that the conceptus has a limited capacity to alter DNA repair responses at the transcript, protein, or activity level following genotoxic teratogen exposure.</description><creator>Vinson, Robert Kenneth.</creator><contributor>Hales, Barbara F.

The comparison is analyzed in the light of H&amp;dotbelow;anafi's three dimensional Islamic reform project known as Heritage and Modernity ( Al-Turath wa al-Tajdid). Their responses to the factors that have led to the decline of Islam in the modern age will be compared from the perspective of the first and second dimensions of his project, which examine the implications of the classical Islamic and Western heritages, respectively, for the reform of Islam. It is, however, in the context of the third dimension of H&amp;dotbelow;anafi's project, which deals with the theory and practice of interpretation, that we will examine their hermeneutics of the return to the Qur'an and the Sunna. In the process we will demonstrate how their respective backgrounds, political influences and concerns have led each of them to adopt a position that is, at one and the same time, radical and traditional.</description><creator>Asmin, Yudian W.</creator><contributor>Federspiel, Howard M.

Conventional voiceband modems treat the PSTN as an analog communication channel. However, today's PSTN is mostly a digital network except for the basic telephone services provided via analog subscriber lines. The conventional model of analog voiceband channels is no longer adequate to characterize the physical connection between terminals with direct digital access to the network and voiceband modems connected to analog subscriber lines. Such a connection requires a different model in each direction. There are now international modem standards which support rates of up to 56 kbits/s for the down-stream channel. This dissertation examines the more challenging part of the voiceband communication channel, i.e., the up-stream direction connecting an analog subscriber to the digital network. The major source of distortion on the up-stream channel is quantization error caused by analog-to-digital conversion performed as part of the encoding to Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM) process. A bandpass filter prior to the PCM encoder restricts the bandwidth while the sampling rate of the PCM encoder is predetermined by the network. Signalling in the presence of such constraints lead to theoretical problems as well as practical concerns in modem design. Communication models that characterize PCM voiceband channels are developed. We investigate modulation design and related issues including index mapping, constellation design and constellation probability assignment to match the pre-determined structure of the detector at the receiver, i.e., the PCM encoder at the central office. We develop a framework for transmitter structures that can avoid or reduce Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) at the receiver in order to sidestep the limited bandwidth of the up-stream channels and the fixed sampling rate of the up-stream channel. Techniques employed include linear filtering, spectral shaping and precoding to reduce the ISI, while limiting the average transmitted signal power. A filterbank structure for pre-equalizing channels with spectral nulls is also described. A new method for pulse shaping design is proposed. The new pulse shaping filters provide a compatible design that can be used for the up-stream PCM channel as well as to the cascade of the up-stream and the down-stream channels. Compared to conventional modem design, the proposed modulation and pre-equalization techniques together allow for an increase of the data transmission rates in the up-stream direction of up to 50%.</description><creator>Alagha, Nader Sheikholeslami.</creator><contributor>Kabal, Peter (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Modulation, pre-equalization and pulse shaping for PCM voiceband channels</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r781wh675.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dz010r82h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q811km315</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:46:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Papermakers are highly interested in upgrading mechanical paper by retarding or inhibiting the lignin color reversion. Yellowing can be prevented by screening UV light on the surface and adding yellowing inhibitors into papers. Surface treatment of paper in a size press by an inhibitor-starch mixture has more advantages compared to other methods. A novel microscopy technique using scanning electron microscopy is developed to identify and measure the polymer penetration into sized sheets. The kinetics of starch adsorption on wood fibers was elucidated. An initial high adsorption of cationic starch on pulp fibers is off set by high desorption rates. Furthermore the adsorption of hydroxyethyl ether starch increases smoothly with time due to polymer penetration into the macropores. At high salt concentrations, cationic starch does not make strong bonds with negatively charged fibers and as a result the desorption rate increases and the maximum adsorption approaches zero. The presence of salt has little effect on the adsorption of non-ionic hydroxyethyl ether starch. Preferential adsorption of amyIose compared to amylopectin on cellulosic fibers is related to the size exclusion mechanism involved in polymer penetration into macropores. The presence of cationic starch clusters is confirmed. The clusters initially adsorb on the fiber surface; however due to a higher desorption rate they are gradually replaced by individual polymers. The cluster size decreases with increasing shear in the presence of salt in cationic starch solutions. The cluster desorption rate for pulp fibers is higher than that for glass substrates. This might be due to different surface chemistry or roughness between pulp fibers and glass substrates. The maximum adsorption on glass substrates increases by increasing the cluster size. Hydroxyethyl ether starch does not form clusters and shear and the presence of salt have a minor effect on the polymer size. Starch pickup by paper during surface sizing depends on the liquid absorption at the puddle and counter pressure of the trapped air in the pores. Starch viscosity, paper velocity and nip load have no effect on the thickness of the starch layer across the sized paper. However, for thick boards penetration increases by increasing the nip load due to lower sheet thickness at higher nip load. For sized board, the starch penetration is less for cationic starch than for hydroxyethyl ether starch due to higher viscosity and adsorption. For the sized sheets with yellowing inhibitor/starch mixtures, the paper brightness after aging is affected by inhibitor concentration in the solution, since operating conditions have little effect on pickup. Using cationic starch slightly increases the brightness for boards, while it has little effect on paper brightness.</description><creator>Shirazi, Mehdi.</creator><contributor>Esmail, Nabil (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Garnier, Gil (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Surface application of yellowing inhibitors into paper</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s7526d94v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q811km315</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2227mr532</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:46:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Conventional wisdom in ecotoxicology predicts reductions in organismal fitness to follow from exposure-related physiological effects. This expectation may be appropriate for controlled laboratory environments, but may not necessarily reflect what is likely to take place in the wild. In an extensive review of the ecotoxicology literature, it was revealed that fish condition factor (an index of energetic fitness) is just as likely to respond favourably to pollutant exposure as it is to respond negatively. The remainder of this thesis examines some of the ecological reasons for this apparent paradox. One possible cause of altered energetic status in wild, pollutant-exposed fish is variable food availability. Addressing this possibility, I showed that consumption rates (estimated using a 137Cesium mass-balance approach) were not related to growth reductions in hormonally-impaired yellow perch ( Perca flavescens) from metal-contaminated lakes. Another possibility is that fish forage less efficiently in metal-polluted lakes as a result of lowered prey choice. In this thesis, I develop an enzymatic and individual-based biomarker for fish activity costs (muscle lactate dehydrogenase, LDH, activity) and show, through the use of this tool that the cost of fish activity is intimately tied to prey type and the ability to make normal ontogenetic diet shifts. Through the application of LDH measurements, as well as through bioenergetic modelling, diet and prey community analyses, a link between decreased prey choice and high perch activity costs leading to zero growth efficiency (energetic bottlenecks) was demonstrated in yellow perch from metal-contaminated lakes. This finding provided one of the first examples in ecotoxicology of a mechanistic link between community and organismal endpoints.

The early diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer has become an important health care concern. A recent study reported the median waiting time for breast cancer surgery in Quebec was 34 days with 14% of women waiting in excess of 90 days. Understanding the determinants of long waiting is essential to develop optimum interventions to reduce delay. Objective. The purpose of this study was to identify the determinants of waiting time to surgery among women with primary breast cancer in Quebec between 1992 and 1997. Methods. The target population was all women 20 years and older diagnosed with primary breast cancer in Quebec between 1992 and 1997. The data was compiled from physician fee-for-service claims maintained by the Regie de I'assurance maladie du Quebec (RAMQ); the Quebec hospital discharge database (MedEcho), and the 1991 Canadian census. Waiting time was defined as the number of days from the initial breast diagnostic procedure to the first definitive surgical treatment. Three-level hierarchical linear models were used for statistical analysis. Findings . Overall, 13,383 women with primary breast cancer treated by 614 surgeons in 107 hospitals were identified. No statistically significant variation of waiting time was found among hospitals. Longer waiting times for breast cancer surgery were observed for women 50 to 64 years of age, without comorbidity, with history of benign breast disease, living in the lower education areas, having surgery at day-surgery setting, having surgery in more recent years, or having surgery performed by younger a surgeon (20 to 49 years old). Women who had surgery performed in a teaching hospital had longer waiting times and this effect was larger when mastectomy was performed. These results could be used to identify women and care delivery practices at higher risk for delays which could be the focus of interventions.</description><creator>Shen, Ningyan, 1961-</creator><contributor>Goldberg, Mark S.

This thesis examines separately the two dimensions of the topic but follows a logical progression that concludes with a third section. The first section explores the hypothesis that the literary series is the outcome of a long process of definition and specialization which has accompanied the evolution of French publishing and literature. It then goes on to examine cases illustrating the "convergence" of the two, such as the "Bibliotheque Bleue", the "Bibliotheque universelle des romans", the "Bibliotheque Charpentier", the collections of livraisons illustrees published in the 1850's, the "Collection Michel Levy" and a few collections published by Flammarion and Fayard. Following a rereading of the Genettien paratexte (1987) that reviews and further refines the parameters of the concept (its boundaries, its components and their functions) in order to increase its scope of action, the second section explores in depth the essence of the encounter between the series and literature itself and proposes a theory of the series which positions it in relation to a community of readers and recognizes a different functioning, different risks and effects depending on whether it is destined for a specialized public or the general public. Finally, the third section picks up the historical thread that the first section suspended at the beginning of the 20th century</description><creator>Montreuil, Sophie.</creator><contributor>Ricard, Francois (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Transmission of texts.</subject><subject>Series (Publications)</subject><subject>French literature -- History and criticism.</subject><title>Le livre en serie : histoire et theorie de la collection letteraire</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/12579t92w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8623j0508</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:000001715</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:46:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The CDP/Cux transcription factor contains four DNA binding domains: three Cut repeats (CR1, CR2 and CR3) and the Cut homeodomain (HD). The CCAAT-displacement protein (CDP) was first identified as it represses transcription of certain promoters by competing for the occupancy of the CCAAT sequence. CDP was then found to be the ortholog of the Drosophila Cut protein (Cux: Cu t homeobox&amp;barbelow;). The goal of my project was to define the modes of interactions of CDP/Cux with DNA. I demonstrated that high affinity DNA binding requires the cooperation between at least two of the CDP/Cux DNA binding domains. Among all combinations of domains, Cut repeats 1 and 2 (CR1CR2) and Cut repeat 3 and the Cut homeodomain (CR3HD) exhibited the highest DNA binding affinities, but with different kinetics and specificities. Whereas CR1CR2 bound with fast kinetics to dimers of CART or CGAT, CR3HD bound to ATCGAT with slow kinetics. CR1CR2 was shown to be responsible for the CCAAT displacement activity of CDP/Cux. Surprisingly, the full-length CDP/Cux protein, p200, exhibited DNA binding properties similar to that of CR1CR2, indicating that CR3HD is inactive in this context. However, an amino terminally truncated 110 KDa CDP/Cux isoform capable of stable interaction with DNA was identified in cellular extracts. The p110 isoform was shown to be generated by proteolytic cleavage of p200 at the G1/S transition. The p200 and p110 isoforms displayed different transcriptional activities in reporter assays, as only p110 was able to activate transcription from the DNA polymerase a gene promoter. Interestingly, expression of p110 was found to be increased in human uterine leiomyomas as compared to the adjacent normal myometrium, raising the possibility that proteolytic processing of CDP/Cux is activated in cancer cells. Finally, cyclin D/CDK4 was shown to interact with CDP/Cux, phosphorylate it on several serine residues and inhibit proteolytic processing as well as DNA binding by CR3HD.

This thesis proposes a new design method for the control of these linear time-periodic systems. First, Floquet-Lyapunov theory is used to derive the Floquet factors of the state-transition matrix of a given system. We introduce a novel approach to obtain every real representation. It is demonstrated that the periodicity of the periodic factor can be determined a priori using a constant matrix, which we call the Yakubovich matrix, based upon the signs of the eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix. We then introduce a novel method for the numerical computation of the Floquet factors, relying upon a boundary-value problem formulation and the Yakubovich matrix. In the second part, we use the invertibility of the controllability Gramian and a specific form for the feedback gain matrix to build a novel control law for the closed-loop system. The new controller can be full-state or observer-based and allows the control engineer to assign all the invariants of the system, i.e. the full monodromy matrix. Deriving the feedback matrix requires first solving a matrix integral equation for the periodic Floquet factor of the new state-transition matrix of the closed-loop system. This is achieved via a spectral method, which can then be further refined by a boundary-value problem formulation. Computational efficiency of the scheme may be further improved by performing the controller synthesis on the transformed system obtained from the reducibility theorem. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is illustrated with an application to a quick-return mechanism using a software toolbox developed for MATLAB(TM).</description><creator>Montagnier-Michau, Pierre Jean Andre.</creator><contributor>Angeles, J.

Inclass observations, retrospective interviews and questionnaires were used to examine the possible effects of this instructional approach on the students' causal thinking patterns. Inquiry was found to have a possible influence on three of the four students' causal attributions. These three student's causal attributions shifted from a maladaptive pattern to a more adaptive pattern while using an inquiry curriculum. Inquiry was believed to be linked to the changes found in three of the students insofar as effort and control are integral parts of an inquiry curriculum. The fourth student's attributional pattern was largely unaffected by the inquiry curriculum. The results are further interpreted in light of the instructional context and the teacher's influence and control over the inquiry process.</description><creator>Mitchell, Sidney N.</creator><contributor>Rejskind, Gillian (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Active learning.</subject><subject>Underachievers.</subject><title>Describing the possible effects of an inquiry curriculum on low-achieving students' causal attributions</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k06989095.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rn301291d</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ht24wk92n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:46:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis project was designed to investigate the phenotypic and genotypic variability of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) drug-naive clade C reverse transcriptase (RT) and its potential impact in the development of resistance against inhibitors of RT. Five treatment-naive HIV-1 Ethiopian isolates were classified as subtype C on the basis of env gene heteroduplex mobility assays (HMA) profile and phylogenetic analysis of RT sequences. In subtype C RT, a specific KVEQ motif of silent mutations (amino acid 65, 106, 138, 161) at resistance sites was present. Two Ethiopian strains were naturally resistant to non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTI), as well as to zidovudine (ZDV), based on the natural polymorphisms of G190A and K70R, respectively. The final drug concentration that selected for NNRTI primary resistance mutations in tissue culture assays was significantly higher for clade B than clade C for each of nevirapine (NW) (10 muM versus 2 or 4 muM), efavirenz (EFV) (1muM versus 0.01muM) and delaviridine (DLV) (10muM versus 1 or 4muM), respectively. In the middle of the selection period with all the NNRTIs, subtype B viruses were harboring a mixture of both wild type and mutated forms, whereas in clade C viruses, primary resistance mutations were fully generated. Thus, we have found that clade C isolates developed more rapidly resistance (8 or 9 weeks with NVP or DLV and 13 weeks with EFV) as compared with clade B controls (at least 15 weeks with NW or DLV and 30 weeks with EFV). Odd mutations were detected during selection with NNRTIs, such as S98I, and two mutations (A62V and V75E), at sites associated to multi-drug resistance against nucleoside inhibitors (NRTIs). The substitution A62V was initially observed as a drug-naive silent mutation A62A. NW and DLV mutants were broadly cross-resistants.

It has been written as chronological narrative using an evolving systems approach as a methodology for an instrumental case-study design. The creative teacher is a 47-year-old female with over 20 years experience with elementary, secondary, college, and university students. Five interviews were conducted with the teacher before, during, and following the course. Data sets include classroom observations revealed in field notes, documents such as course materials and audiotaped interviews. Two interviews were conducted with six students at the beginning and end of the course. One interview was conducted with the teacher's husband at the end of the course. The research context was an undergraduate university classroom of 146 preservice teachers studying how to plan curriculum and instruction for diverse learners. All interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. The overarching themes represented constructs involving intense and thorough course preparation, teacher-student connections, and reflective teaching. Overlapping subthemes guiding the process of creative teaching emerged including constraints placed on preparation and reflective teaching, an awareness of self and students within the process of preparation and connection, feedback from colleagues and students guiding the connection and reflective teaching, and the values and goals formed from personal history and philosophy of life shaping all three major themes. The teacher's personality acted as a conduit for expressing her creativity in the classroom. Her creative process was directed by her personality to choose the materials and methods of developing curriculum and instruction, and to guide her in her reflective teaching. This revelatory case example of creative teaching possesses characteristics resembling studies of creative giants, however presents a model of the process of creative teaching that can be ins</description><creator>Lilly, Frank R.</creator><contributor>Rejskind, Gillian (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Creative thinking.</subject><subject>Teaching -- Case studies.</subject><title>Teaching outside of the box : studying a creative teacher</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qv33rz31r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rf55z945w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1r66j2803</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:46:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Recent medical and surgical advances have greatly enhanced the survival of children with congenital heart defects that were once considered lethal or extremely debilitating. Consequently there now is a shift in concern from the integrity of the heart to that of the brain. Studies that describe the spectrum of developmental disabilities are lacking in these new survivors. The primary objective of this doctoral thesis was to characterize the extent and nature of neurodevelopmental impairments and disabilities in young infants with congenital heart defects, using a range of standardized developmental and functional measures, as well as electrophysiological techniques. A high prevalence of acute neurologic, motor, and global developmental impairments were present in our cohort at the time of surgery, and persisted well after surgical intervention. Moreover, functional difficulties and greater dependence in self-care and mobility were also common in this population. Somatosensory evoked potential abnormalities in newborns were found to be very predictive of developmental delays. Multiple markers (i.e. medical, surgical, developmental, and environmental) of brain injury were identified that appear to collectively mediate the outcome of this vulnerable group of children. Clearly, this is a high-risk population that would benefit from routine developmental screening by rehabilitation specialists. This would facilitate early identification of those at risk and permit the institution of early intervention programs to maximize outcome and minimize burden of care.</description><creator>Limperopoulos, Catherine.</creator><contributor>Majnemer, Annette (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Neurodevelopmental sequelae in young children with congenital heart defects undergoing open heart surgery</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k0698910x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1r66j2803</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Physical and Occupational Therapy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:b5644t200</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:46:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Literary criticism has traditionally associated the work of Albert Camus with a very specific conception of literature. His more "philosphical" works (namely, his essays) are thus seen as demonstrations of the "message" that his truly literary works seek to transmit. As such, Le Mythe de Sisyphe and L'Homme revolte are considered to provide the driving themes (l'Absurde and la Revolte) of the author's fictive writings. This image (that of the "romancier a message") becomes problematic, however, in face of Camus' intransigent refusal to surrender to any form of dogma. Indeed, for the author, this possibility of surrender constitutes the greatest threat to la Revolte, representing its potential capitulation into Revolution and Terror. We believe that this notion of literature as a vehicle for philosophical beliefs is precisely the concept against which Camus was fighting. Through the theme of "le juste", or more specifically the question of how we know what is just, Camus challenges this idea of literature and the act of writing. By exposing the mechanisms of self-justification underlying all universal values (and hence of all transcendental "truths" upon which they are necessarily based) the writer reveals them to be social and discursive constructs which permit and perpetuate the imposition of norms in a given domaine, including that of literature. This study proposes to examine Camus' rapport with this element of self-justification in literature, and the ways in which he calls the latter into question.</description><creator>Lincoln, Lissa.</creator><contributor>Lane-Mercier, Gillian (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Justice in literature</subject><subject>Camus, Albert, 1913-1960 -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><title>Le juste chez Camus /</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9w0324647.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b5644t200</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:tb09j7131</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:46:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>As Lower Canada/Quebec industrialized, the system of poor relief that developed followed a private, confessional model. While the Catholic Church controlled services for Catholics, the lay Protestant elite controlled the relief network for their community. Elite women played a major role in this network, managing most of the charities for women and children. This thesis uses the two most important female-directed Montreal charities---the Protestant Orphan Asylum and the Montreal Ladies' Benevolent Society---to study Protestant charity and particularly child charity from 1822 to 1900. It examines the organization and work of female charity committees as well as the services offered, the relevance of gender to charity management, and attitudes to childhood and family. Extensive source material, from the archives of the two societies, enables an analysis of the characteristics of the children admitted, as well as of the management committees, and their policies. In this period, serving on a charity board was an expected activity for elite women. As a result, committees had many members. However, this thesis reveals that only a small number of women actually participated in the substantial administrative and organizational work that was involved in running a charity. This lack of participation made it more difficult to supervise the institutions and to organize fund-raising events. Formed by the elite to regulate as well as to help the poor, these charities permit an examination of working-class agency. Organisers used their control of admissions and discharges as well as the institutional regime to impose their values of parenting and work. Nonetheless, the study of these two charities shows that families managed to use charities to shelter their children temporarily, occasionally circumventing restrictive access rules or challenging a charity's refusal to discharge children. As "ladies" acting in public, the women in control of these charities were influenced by restrictive gender ideologies, particularly that of "separate spheres." Gender conscious and conservative, they respected social conventions in their public appearances and deferred to men in critical areas such as investments. Yet, at the same time, they affirmed their abilities and defended their authority and their autonomy in areas considered in the women's sphere, including child-care and charity management. Understanding charity from within a conservative culture that emphasized religion, tradition, and values like work, family, and social hierarchy, these benevolent women sought to relieve the poor but they also sought to train useful citizens. In their charity work, they faced many complex questions connected to child abuse, changes in apprenticeship systems, adequate training for children, and the rights of parents. This study argues that both their conservative approach and their women's culture, centered on a personal approach, influenced the way they dealt with these issues. Of equal importance, however, was the experience they had acquired over years of child-charity work. As a result of these factors, their emphasis on protecting the children under their care increased over time. Consequently, the policies they developed in favour of helping families with temporary care and in favour of using apprenticeship and finally extended training in the institution itself diverged from those advocated by late-century reform groups, which opted for placing children in families instead of institutions and which advocated more restrictive, scientific charity methods.</description><creator>Harvey, Janice.</creator><contributor>Young, Brian (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Orphanages -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- History.</subject><subject>Social service -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- History.</subject><subject>Child welfare -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- History.</subject><subject>Protestant Orphan Asylum.</subject><subject>Montreal Ladies' Benevolent Society.</subject><title>The Protestant Orphan Asylum and the Montreal Ladies' Benevolent Society : a case study in Protestant child charity in Montreal, 1822-1900</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/08612q264.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tb09j7131</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4t64gp98w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:46:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis investigates the binding of overt and null subject pronouns in second language (L2) acquisition and first language (L1) attrition of Turkish. The aim is to provide a comparative investigation of language transfer effects in the ultimate state of the L2 and L1 grammar. More specifically, it examines transfer effects from English L1 and English L2 into the grammars of Turkish L2 and Turkish L1, respectively. In this thesis, I propose that the Subset Condition (Berwick, 1985; Manzini &amp; Wexler, 1987) can account for transfer phenomena observed in both L2 acquisition and L1 attrition. I argue that the subset relation that holds between the L1 and the L2 can be a predictor for the extent and duration of cross-linguistic transfer in L2 acquisition and L1 attrition. In other words, whether or not a particular property will resist L2 acquisition and undergo L1 attrition can be determined by looking at the subset relationship between the L1 and the L2 with respect to that property. The prediction is that in configurations where the 'influencing language' (L1 in L2 acquisition and L2 in L1 attrition) is the superset of the 'affected language' (L2 in L2 acquisition and L1 in L1 attrition), L1 transfer effect will persist in L2 acquisition and we will see more signs of L2 transfer into the L1 grammar, resulting in more attrition effects. Pronominal binding is chosen to investigate such cross-linguistic transfer effects. English and Turkish differ with respect to governing domains and types of pronominals present in two languages. Turkish, being a pro-drop language, allows null subject pronouns in main and embedded clauses. It also has a special type of anaphoric pronominal, kendisi, for which English has no corresponding form. Two experiments were conducted to test L2 acquisition and L1 attrition of binding properties of Turkish overt and null subject pronouns under the influence of English. Participants included native English-speakers living in Turkey (end-state L2 Turkish speakers) and native Turkish-speakers living in North America (end-state L2 English speakers). Overall, results obtained from the two studies reveal cross-linguistic transfer effects in the manner predicted. In particular, properties of English overt pronouns (e.g., him/her) are transferred onto the overt Turkish pronoun o in L2 acquisition and in attrition, whereas properties of the Turkish null pronoun and the anaphoric pronominal kendisi are unaffected by English.</description><creator>Gürel, Ayşe.</creator><contributor>White, Lydia (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Turkish language -- Pronoun</subject><subject>Language attrition</subject><subject>Second language acquisition -- Cross-cultural studies</subject><subject>Language transfer (Language learning)</subject><title>Linguistic characteristics of second language acquisition and first language attrition : Turkish overt versus null pronouns</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cn69m565h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4t64gp98w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Linguistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g732db65h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:46:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Pain perception is highly dependant on the conscious state of the individual and the meaning of the pain. Patients who have pain associated with life-threatening diseases such as cancer may have a heightened state of arousal and focus on their pain, which serves to increase the pain experience. Conversely, professional athletes sustain devastating injuries and continue playing with little or no pain. The studies I have conducted for my Ph.D. have focused on how conscious state alters pain perception, as well as the neural circuitry underlying such modulation. In separate studies, PET and fMRI were used to examine pain perception. The first study examined the cerebral structures necessary for the conscious experience of pain by administering increasing doses of propofol, a non-analgesic anesthetic. Results revealed that at sedative doses, subjects' pain perception was heightened, with associated increased activation in thalamus and cortico-limbic areas. When subjects lost consciousness and stopped responding to the painful stimulus, pain-evoked activation in thalamus and cortical regions (particularly anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)) was dramatically reduced, whereas cerebellar activation remained intact. The second study assessed the effect of hypnotic suggestions to alter the perceived intensity of the sensory-discriminative dimension of the pain experience. Findings revealed that an individual's interpretation of a painful event alters perception, and that the perceptual alteration is subserved by changes in activity in primary somatosensory pathways. The final study investigated the alterations in pain perception in a patient with chronic pain. Data showed that abnormal pain evoked by lightly brushing the skin (allodynia) activated the same cortical neural circuitry as normal pain, demonstrated that whether pain is provoked by normal activation of nociceptive pathways or by central disinhibition of pain pathways through loss of sensory input, there is a signature neural circuitry that corresponds to the conscious appreciation of pain. Together, these studies demonstrate that there is a complex thalamo-cortical neural circuit that is activated during the conscious appreciation of pain, and that activation within this circuit can be modulated by conscious state, resulting in altered pain perception.</description><creator>Hofbauer, Robert Kenneth.</creator><contributor>Bushnell, M.

Since all existing evidence points to a role for uPA in breast cancer progression, exploring the mechanisms regulating its gene expression will be of immense value. Two human breast cancer cell lines were selected for this study. MDA-MB-231 represents late stage breast cancer. This cell line has high uPA expression and is highly invasive. In contrast, the MCF-7 cell line represents early stage breast cancer and fails to express detectable levels of uPA mRNA. I have demonstrated by methylation specific PCR (MSP) that the differential expression of the uPA gene in MDA MB-231 and MCF-7 cells closely correlates with the amount of methylated cytosines present within the uPA promoter in these cells. The observation that the DNA methylation status of the uPA promoter directly affects the expression of the uPA gene was then confirmed using an in vitro luciferase reporter assay. Results suggest that the accessibility of the transcription factor Ets-1 is limited by DNA methylation. I further reported increased demethylase (DMase) activity with decreased maintenance activity of methyltransferases (DNMTs), which together favor the generation of a hypomethylated uPA promoter in these highly invasive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Given the pivotal role of uPA in breast cancer progression, I then disrupted the function of uPA and studied its effects on cancer progression. The effects of an 8-mer synthetic peptide (A6) derived from the non-receptor-binding region of uPA were investigated. This peptide inhibits cancer cell invasion of both human (MDA-MB-231) and rat breast cancer cells (Mat B-III) using an in vitro cell invas</description><creator>Guo, Yongjing, 1972-</creator><contributor>Rabbani, Shafaat A.

It is argued that not unlike other restructuring processes, privatization is likely to generate organizational changes that may lead to major alterations in employment quality. Few studies, however, have investigated the labor effects of privatization and other restructuring processes in a comparative manner, especially in developing countries. The overall purpose of this dissertation is to contribute to the understanding of the labor consequences of privatization in developing countries. This objective is undertaken through an exploration of the association between privatization and other restructuring processes occurring within the Brazilian banking industry and changes in employment quality, i.e., fluctuations in wages, non-wage benefits and job security. The most basic premise guiding this study's comparative framework is that the process of privatization is likely to affect labor in unique ways, that is, generating employment quality changes unlike those occurring at other sectors undergoing alternative restructuring processes. The sample consists of 476 respondents: employees (survivors) and ex-employees (retrenched) of public, privatized and private banks. Data were collected in 1998 by using a method of triangulation, i.e., surveys and in-depth semi-structured interviews. The principal results for this study confirm that changes in employment quality are more significant for workers associated with the privatized sector when compared to workers affiliated with other sectors of the Brazilian banking industry. Both quantitative and qualitative data for this study suggest that significant transformations in employment quality occurred as a result of privatization. It is further argued that the decline in employment quality after privatization can be conversely understood as a negative commitment on the part of Brazilian employers. This lack of commitment can be ultimately associated with a new developmental model with a particular type of economic orientation and specific form of labor organization based on flexibility.</description><creator>Chapoval, Iêda.</creator><contributor>von Eschen, Donald (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Tzeng, Jessie (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Bank employees -- Job satisfaction -- Brazil</subject><subject>Privatization -- Brazil</subject><subject>Banks and banking -- Brazil</subject><subject>Brazil -- Economic conditions -- 1985-</subject><title>Privatization and its labor consequences in developing countries : a case study of the Brazilian banking industry privatization process</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/th83m098k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j96022490</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Sociology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cc08hh130</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:46:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A four dimensional variational (4D-Var) formulation is developed for the assimilation of radar reflectivity, Doppler velocities, and near-surface refractivity index data into a non-hydrostatic fully compressible limited-area atmospheric model coupled with a simplified warm microphysics scheme. The cloud-model is used as a weak constraint so the model error is explicit in the 4D-Var formulation. The ultimate goal is to provide initial conditions to a high-resolution numerical weather prediction model. The environmental flow around storms is modelled by a linear wind in a moving frame using Doppler velocity measurements over a given assimilation window. A three-stage procedure is established to solve the assimilation problem. The background-, observationand model-error statistics are adaptively estimated by comparison with a posteriori residuals and they converge after only a few minimizations. During the adaptive procedure, a smoothing constraint is applied to the analysis variables. The smoothing constraint diminishes towards zero for the last minimization while still leading to a smooth analysis. Experiments with synthetic data from model outputs at 1 km horizontal resolution show that the method is able to retrieve unobserved variables. An assimilation period of 10 minutes is shown to be optimal for the analysis of clouds. All the other variables of the model are rather insensitive to the assimilation period. Here the model time step has been varied from 1 to 5 minutes. Most of the a posteriori residual distributions have a high kurtosis while the velocity and the near-surface refractivity index residual distributions are nearly Gaussian. The data assimilation for the case of a shallow hailstorm suggests that the model used for the assimilation is able to forecast the system for 30 minutes within the estimated observational errors. Application of the method to the initialization of the MC2 model leads to a better forecast of a convective system over 40 minutes than the nowcasting technique based on Lagrangian persistence.</description><creator>Caya, Alain.</creator><contributor>Zawadzki, Isztar (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</subject><title>Assimilation of radar observations into a cloud-resolving model</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f4752j411.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cc08hh130</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mg74qn657</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:46:08Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Functional literacy is difficult to achieve for the deaf population. Sixty percent of deaf high school students read at or below grade four, eight percent read at or above grade eight. The present study investigated two factors that may contribute to these individual differences in reading achievement in the deaf signing population: signed language comprehension skills and word recognition skills. In Study 1, 31 deaf adults (12 women and 19 men) between the ages of 17 and 54 years were categorized as either a Good Reader or Poor Reader to determine what factors would differentiate them. These groups were tested with a battery of background questionnaires, speech use and comprehension, communication, hearing, nonverbal IQ measures, three signed language measures, and two reading tests. Results showed that the Good and Poor Readers differed significantly on signed language comprehension skills. The Poor Readers (mean reading level grade 3.5) had poor sign language comprehension and the Good Readers (mean reading level grade 10.5) had good sign language comprehension. In Study 2, the Good and Poor Readers tested in Study 1 and a hearing control group (6 women and 8 men) were tested on three lexical decision tasks. Two tasks tested use of phonology in word recognition (spelling-sound correspondence, pseudohomophone tasks) and a third task tested use of sign lexical knowledge (signability task). Across all tasks, the deaf Good Readers were as fast and as accurate as the Hearing Readers, whereas the Poor Readers were slower and made more errors than the other groups. The Poor Readers displayed similar patterns of performance to the Good Readers on the spelling-sound and pseudohomophone tasks. Neither deaf group showed much evidence of using phonological processing whereas the hearing control group did. The Poor Readers showed evidence of using sign lexical knowledge on the signability task. These results together suggest that underdeveloped signed language skills may be a more important factor in the low reading levels of the deaf signing population than word recognition skills.</description><creator>Chamberlain, Charlene.</creator><contributor>Mayberry, Rachel (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Education, Special.</subject><subject>Education, Adult and Continuing.</subject><subject>Education, Reading.</subject><title>Reading skills of deaf adults who sign : good and poor readers compared</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0z708z40s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mg74qn657</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Communication Sciences and Disorders</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):34525</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
