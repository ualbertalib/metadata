Prior to  establishment of the first non-toxic shot zones in Canada, a nation-wide survey of  Pb accumulation in wing bones of young-of-the-year (YY) dabbling and diving ducks  determined the incidence of elevated Pb exposure in different parts of the country  (Scheuhammer &amp; Dickson, 1996). The objective of the present study was to  determine the incidence of elevated Pb accumulation in the same species several  years after the national ban on Pb shot; to survey waterfowl hunters to determine  approximate levels of compliance with the Pb shot ban; and to use stable Pb isotope  analysis to help determine the relative importance of different sources of Pb  exposure. Wing bones from 721 YY black, mallard, and ring necked ducks,  and 579 YY woodcock from selected zones in Ontario, Quebec, BC, and the Maritimes,  Canada were analyzed for Pb using flame atomic absorption spectrometry.

Energy demanding  processes such as distillation and drying have to be optimised to the highest  extent, while retaining or improving the final product quality. Pretreatments to  drying can be used in order to optimize drying, and some of cranberry pretreatments  such as chemical, mechanical and osmotic dehydration were optimized. Chemical  pretreatment consisted of dipping cranberries into solution of ethyl oleate and  sodium hydroxide at different temperatures, and process times. Mechanical  pretreatment was cutting of berries into halves or quarters. Tested parameters for  osmotic dehydration were the duration of process, osmotic agent type and its  concentration. Once the appropriate pretreatment was selected, cranberries were  subjected to hybrid drying under subatmospheric pressure and using microwaves as an  energy source. Evaluated process parameters were microwave power level, microwave  power mode, and the operating pressure of process. This drying method showed good  potential, but in order to verify the results obtained, it was compared to  microwave/convective drying. Slight advantages of the microwave/vacuum process over  the microwave/convective process were apparent in almost all product quality  parameters, as well as in process efficiency.</description><creator>Sunjka, Predrag S.</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Cranberries -- Drying.</subject><subject>Microwave drying.</subject><title>Microwavevacuum and osmotic drying of cranberries</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r207tp96z.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9s161679d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1g05fc24s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:11:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A novel and rapid method was developed to monitor the  autoxidation of edible oils by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with  the use of disposable polymer infrared (PIR) cards having a microporous  polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) sample substrate.

Foreign-born persons applying for permanent  residence in Canada must undergo radiographic screening for tuberculosis (TB). As a  screening tool for TB, however, the chest x-ray has a number of  limitations. Objectives. To evaluate the reliability of chest radiographic  screening as well as its ability to detect prevalent active TB and predict future  incident disease in immigrants to Canada. Methods. Immigration screening x-rays were categorized by 12  physicians experienced in TB; observer agreement was calculated using the kappa  coefficient. The prevalence and incidence of active TB diagnosed among applications  screened at the Montreal Chest Institute between 1995 and 1998 was  measured. Results. Intra- and inter-observer agreement was fair to  moderate. Among 36,433 applicants screened, 53 prevalent cases were detected  (0.145%) and 19 incident cases were reported post-screening (25.7 per 100,000  person-years). Conclusion. Radiographic screening successfully detects  immigrants with active TB but is limited in preventing future incident cases.  Observer agreement needs to be improved.</description><creator>Saunders, Andrea J.</creator><contributor>Menzies, R.

One method would be to use  the differential attenuation measured between the two frequencies of the radar as an  indication of the rain rate. Microwave attenuation is widely regarded as a good  estimator of the intensity of precipitation. The theory of microwave attenuation is  presented, as well as an estimation of the error sources involved in the measurement  of attenuation with dual-wavelength radars. Two long-time datasets of disdrometer  data are used to test the feasibility of tuning the radar Z - R relationship by  measuring the relation between reflectivity and X-band attenuation. As an  interesting fact, a surprising proportionality between these two variables is found  for higher intensities of precipitation (Z &gt; 40 dBZ). This finding limits the  capabilities of dual-wavelength radars to use attenuation as a second parameter,  since at higher reflectivities X-band attenuation is almost equivalent to  reflectivity.</description><creator>Perez, Marco A.</creator><contributor>Zawadzki, Isztar (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</subject><title>Improving precipitation estimates from dual-wavelength radars</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vt150j85x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3j333283m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:00000067c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:11:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Since the discovery of Dendritic cells (DCs) in 1975, their role  as potent antigen presenting cells has been a field of intense interest and  research. Candidate DC vaccines take advantage of the role of DCs in one of two  ways. The first technique relies on the in vivo isolation of DCs which are then  subsequently employed directly as adjuvants. In the second method, hematopoeitic  growth factors are added to stimulate the expansion and proliferation of these cells  in vivo. Due to the dearth of DCs, research has focused on the addition of growth  factors such as FLT3-L (fms-like tyrosine kinase 3-ligand) and GM-CSF  (granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor) which have proven invaluable for  the expansion of this cell type. The goal of our study has been to deliver these  growth factors intramuscularly using a plasmid vector. This work has shown that DCs  are efficiently generated in vivo following a single intramuscular co-injection of  cDNA encoding GM-CSF and FLT3-L.</description><creator>Peretz, Yoav</creator><contributor>Prud'homme, Gerald J.

In these studies, females had a tendency to  rate the intensity of pain higher than males, but males had stronger affective  responses following the surgical placement of intra-oral implants. However, these  findings have not been investigated in an experimental setting. This experiment  examined the pain responses of 20 healthy subjects (10 males, 10 females), who were  subjected to capsaicin-induced pain on the face and ankle (on separate sessions).  During the experiment, all subjects rated their pain intensity, unpleasantness, and  anxiety on visual analog scales (VAS). In addition, throughout the experiment, heart  rate was monitored every five minutes and mood was assessed once before and after  the experiment. Finally, subjects also completed the McGill Pain Questionnaires  (MPQ) once at the end of every session. Results revealed that although there were  generally no statistically significant sex differences in the pain ratings during  the experiment, there was a sex * time interaction with males displaying increasing  anxiety scores over time with the capsaicin patch on the face while the anxiety  scores of females decreased over time with the capsaicin patch on the face (F =  1.64, P = 0.02). Also, there was a tendency for the relative unpleasantness  (unpleasantness/intensity ratio) to be greater for males than females over time on  the face (F = 3.43, P = 0.08). Males and females did not differ in both the mean  number of words chosen and the pain rating index of the MPQ for all categories. In  addition, there were no sex differences for heart rate and mood for both the ankle  and face regions throughout the experiment. Taken together, these results replicate  previous findings that men may find low levels of pain more disturbing than women.</description><creator>Marchie, Alfonse</creator><contributor>Bushnell, M.

Sites were established in Riviere-du-Loup, Quebec from May to October of 1999 and  2000, and Shippagan, New Brunswick from May to October of 2001. CH4 emissions from E. vaginatum collars were positively related  to maximum photosynthesis in 1999 and 2001, when the water table was close to the  surface. CH4 emissions were also positively related to end of season above ground  plant biomass at both sites. CH4 emissions from E. vaginatum collars ranged from  -0.015 to 14.7 mg CH4-C m-2 h-1 at Riviere-du-Loup and -0.15 to 5.4 mg CH4-C m -2  h-1 at Shippagan. It is likely that E. vaginatum provides substrate for  methanogenesis through plant production and acts as a conduit transporting CH4 to  the atmosphere. Patterns of NEE from E. vaginatum depended on site-specific and  year-specific conditions. E. vaginatum was a net sink for CO2 at high and low light  levels at Shippagan, and a net source of CO2 at low light levels at Riviere-du-Loup.</description><creator>Marinier, MichÃ¨le</creator><contributor>Moore, Tim (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Atmospheric methane -- QuÃ©bec (Province) -- RiviÃ¨re-du-Loup</subject><subject>Atmospheric carbon dioxide -- QuÃ©bec (Province) -- RiviÃ¨re-du-Loup</subject><subject>Eriophorum -- New Brunswick -- Shippegan</subject><subject>Atmospheric carbon dioxide -- New Brunswick -- Shippegan</subject><subject>Peatlands -- New Brunswick -- Shippegan</subject><subject>Eriophorum -- QuÃ©bec (Province) -- RiviÃ¨re-du-Loup</subject><subject>Atmospheric methane -- New Brunswick -- Shippegan</subject><subject>Peatlands -- QuÃ©bec (Province) -- RiviÃ¨re-du-Loup</subject><title>The role of cotton-grass (Eriophorum vaginatum) in the cardon dioxide and methane dynamics of two restored peatlands in eastern Canada /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t148fh763.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8336h2556</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vt150j866</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:11:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A possible remediation strategy that involved washing with  complexing reagents(s) [disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (Na2EDTA) alone or in  combination with bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)dithiocarbamate (HEDC)] was evaluated with an  urban soil that had been field contaminated with excesses of heavy metal (HMs).  Heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) were targeted for removal. The aqueous  solution that resulted from, washing was treated with zero-valent (ZV) magnesium  (Mg0) or bimetallic mixture (Pd0/Mg 0 or Ag0/Mg0) to release the chelating  reagent(s) from their heavy metal complexes. During this reaction, the heavy metals  were precipitated from solution as hydroxides or became plated on to the surface of  the excess ZV reagent. Thus, an appreciable fraction of the mobilized Pb and Cu and  a portion of Zn became cemented to the surface of the ZV metal whereas most of the  Fe and Mn were removed from solution as insoluble hydroxides. After filtration and  pH re-adjustment, the demetallized solution was then returned to the soil to extract  more heavy metals. After three washing cycles with the same reagent, it was observed  that the sparing quantity of EDTA (10 mmoles) had mobilized 32--54% of the soil  burden heavy metals (5 mmoles), but only 0.1% of the iron had been  removed. A 1:1 (mol/mol) mixture of EDTA and HEDC proved to be  approximately equally efficient at HM extraction despite more than a three-fold  reduction (3 mmoles) in the quantity of reagents. Three washing with the same  reagent mobilized some 49% of the Pb, 18% of the Zn and 19% of the Mn but only 7% of  the Cu and 1% of the Fe from the test soil.</description><creator>Lee, Chia Chi</creator><contributor>Marshall, W.

In this connection, the synthetic  utility of environmentally benign non-toxic bismuth metal for aqueous organometallic  reactions is investigated. Bismuth metal activated by ammonium hydrogen fluoride can  efficiently reduce a wide variety of alpha-halocarbonyl compounds in aqueous media  to provide the corresponding dehalogenated reduction products in excellent yields.  Zinc fluoride is also found to be effective in activating bismuth to mediate the  crossed aldol type reactions of diverse alpha-bromocarbonyl compounds with aldehydes  in aqueous media to afford the corresponding beta-hydroxycarbonyl compounds in  moderate to high yields. The scope of bismuth-mediated aqueous organometallic  reactions is successfully extended to the Reformatsky type reactions. The factors  that affect the reactivity of these reactions are examined and plausible reaction  mechanisms are proposed.</description><creator>Lee, Yoon Joo, 1974-</creator><contributor>Chan, T. H.

Using P.Pastoris, we have  over-expressed recombinant F2 and achieved uniform labeling of F2 with both 15N and  15N/13C isotopes. The 1H-15N HSQC NMR spectra of F2 and other backbone (13Calpha and  some 13C beta) resonances have been assigned by a combination of proton homonuclear  TOCSY/NOESY and triple-resonance NMR experiments. The 13C alpha conformational  shifts indicate that human F2 assumes secondary structure elements similar to those  found in the crystal structure of human F2 in complex with thrombin. Less than  stoichiometric amounts of thrombin and factor Va were found to perturb subsets of  the HSQC peaks of F2, indicating specific and reversible binding of human F2 with  both thrombin and factor Va. The binding sites on F2 for thrombin and factor Va are  located at distinct surface areas, as shown through an analysis of residue-specific  shifts in the assigned HSQC spectra of F2. Most of the binding residues on F2  identified by NMR correlate well with those identified through functional studies  and/or in the crystal structure of the human F2-thrombin complex. More  interestingly, our NMR studies demonstrate for the first time direct involvement of  the C-terminal region of F2, or the junction residues between kringle 2 and thrombin  in prothrombin, for thrombin binding.

A designer, guided solely by  intuition, is forced to manipulate many interdependent parameters by hand,  introducing simplifying assumptions that artificially limit the potential of the  architecture. The sheer number of possible configurations precludes an exhaustive  exploration of the entire search space. Evolutionary computation is a  domain-independent, highly scalable technique capable of producing innovative  designs with reasonable computational cost. This study presents a software framework for designing  microarchitecture. As a case study, a genetic algorithm is used to automatically  synthesize two-level indirect branch predictors. The evolved designs routinely  deliver enhanced performance as compared to the equivalent, highly optimized  structures created by hand. The primary drawback associated with this method is the  excessive design complexity induced by unconstrained evolution. Several methods of  incorporating simplicity of design into the evolutionary process are investigated. A  unified fitness metric, combining both simplicity and performance, leads to the  evolution of simple and effective designs.</description><creator>Holly, Matthew James</creator><contributor>Driesen, Karel (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>An evolutionary computation framework for microarchitecture design /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v979v371b.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mw22v604j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zk51vh39d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:11:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Response to antipsychotic (AP) medication is critical to  predicting long-term outcome in schizophrenia. This study examined the relationship  between treatment response (TR) and four risk factors for schizophrenia. Method.  Twenty-six outpatients were interviewed to assess childhood trauma and substance  use. Patients' mothers completed interviews concerning family history of  schizophrenia spectrum disorders and obstetric complications. TR was evaluated  through information gleaned from medical records. Results. Family history of  schizophrenia spectrum disorders (FH) was associated with decreased response to  typical APs (r = -.37, p &lt; .05). More severe childhood trauma was associated  with worse TR (r = -.51, p &lt; .001) while premorbid LSD use was associated  with better TR (r = .52, p &lt; .01). Further examination revealed that FH  moderated the effects of trauma and LSD use on response to typical APs. None of the  putative risk factors explained variance in TR to atypical APs. Conclusion.  Childhood trauma and premorbid LSD use may cause permanent neurochemical changes  responsible for altered TR in some individuals.</description><creator>Holowka, Darren W.</creator><contributor>King, Suzanne (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Health Sciences, Mental Health.</subject><title>Explaining treatment response in Schizophrenia : integration of genetic and environmental factors</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5712m722m.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zk51vh39d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychiatry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wp988k537</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:11:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>192Ir is one of the most popular radiation sources used for  brachytherapy treatments. However, 192Ir emits a wide photon spectrum (10 keV to 900  keV) which impedes the creation of an 192Ir primary standard. The 192Ir air kerma  calibration factor is derived by interpolating between 60Co, 137Cs and hard  orthovoltage air kerma calibration factors obtained from a standards laboratory. The  EGSnrc Monte Carlo package was used to calculate the response in low energy photon  beams of a commercial parallel-plate chamber to assess useability as a 192Ir and  kilovoltage photon beam calibration tool. XCOM photoeffect cross-sections were  implemented in EGSnrc to improve kerma calculation agreement at low energies. The  response calculations were compared to experimental data from PTB (Germany).  Overall, agreement between calculations and measurement is good and represents an  improvement to results from the literature. However, discrepancies exist at the  lowest energies which may be caused by differences in the measurement and  calculation geometries.</description><creator>Hobeila, Fadi</creator><contributor>Seuntjens, Jan P.

Whereas the source of phosphate is likely anthropogenic, arsenic  appears to be scavenged from the bottom marine waters by settling detrital and  authigenic particles. The surface waters of the Saguenay Fjord show a particulate  aluminum anomaly ([Al]tot/[Al]diss &gt; 1) that decreases downstream or with  increasing salinity. The mineralogy of the aluminum particulate matter may be akin  to gibbsite given the refining activities in the region. The adsorption of phosphate  and arsenic to various mineral oxides is well established but the scavenging  capacity of gibbsite in this estuarine environment is not known. In order to simulate the behavior of the adsorbent/adsorbate  relationship during estuarine mixing, the adsorption capacity of gibbsite for  arsenate and phosphate was measured in pure water; 0.67 M NaCl; 10 mM CaCl2; 10 mM  CaCl2 + 0.64 M NaCl and in seawater in the absence and presence of the fluoride ion.</description><creator>Garand, Alain</creator><contributor>Mucci, Alfonso (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Geochemistry.</subject><title>The influence of ionic strength and fluoride ion concentration on the adsorption properties of gibbsite : phosphate and arsenate adsorption</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3j333284w.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wd375w98m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zg64tm637</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:11:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Mid-crustal deformation of orogenic belts was investigated  through studies of exhumed terrains in the Belmont Domain of the Composite Arc Belt  deformed during the Grenvillian Orogeny. The western study area shows a family of broad (~10 km)  antiformal sheath structures with NNE-trending axial traces (FM), separated by  tight, nearly upright synforms. Within FM entrained parasitic, very tight folds are  found (FT). The eastern study area shows similar but more subdued sheath structures.  A late fold set (FL), with NW trending axial traces and moderate plunges perturbs FT  and F M. Seismic lines through the region show the crust is dominated by  SE-dipping reflectors previously interpreted as imbricated thrust sheets but now  shown to be the upper limbs of the antiformal sheaths.

In particular, it  explores the personal and collective meanings constructed around women's headache  experiences. Both structured and open-ended interviews were administered to patients  suffering headache to elicit interpretations of headache episodes. An analysis of  the collected narratives suggests that headache is often comprehended in a polysemic  framework, where shifting meanings ascribed in bodily, emotional, family and social  terms articulate both individual and shared notions of suffering: loss of loved  ones, inter-personal conflict, and tension associated to women's roles as homemakers  are among the central themes evoked, and span through past, present and future  domains. In particular, strains in family relationships, in dynamic interaction with  larger contexts of social violence, play a prominent role in the configuration of  headache, often experienced in conditions of solitude and isolation. Overall, this  study underscores the significance of patients' subjective interpretations of  painful experiences and emphasizes the manner through which bodily and emotional  pain are inextricably linked to distress experienced at family and social  levels.</description><creator>Darghouth, Sarah</creator><contributor>Bibeau, Gilles (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Pedersen, Duncan (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Psychology, Physiological.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Mental Health.</subject><title>Painful languages of the body : experiences of headache, pain and suffering in Peru</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qb98mg11z.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6395w7904</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Social and Transcultural Psychiatry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mc87pq92p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:11:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Golgi apparatus of the cell is responsible for crucial  mechanisms such as the intracellular transport of molecules, and the glycosylation  process. It is linked to several serious and deadly diseases, including cancer.  Understanding which proteins make up this organelle, and their associated functions,  is essential to provide scientists with more insight into these related processes.  The localization of Golgi resident proteins is a complex and not yet fully  understood process. It has kept biologists using slow, manual, "wet lab"  methods. Artificial neural networks have the capability of learning complex  relationships from training data, and generalizing beyond these examples. Here, we  present a neural network prediction system based on evolutionary information, which  we extracted from the amino acid sequences in our data set.

Increasing the  enzyme pool in the cheese curd has been shown to accelerate the cheese ageing  process, enhance flavour and texture. The characteristics of two lactic acid  bacteria attenuated by pulsed electric fields were studied in a milk system and in  cheese slurry. The potential of accelerating cheese ripening via the addition of  starter cultures attenuated by pulsed electric fields (PEF) was  studied. Pulsed electric field treatment was performed in a static  treatment chamber using bi-polar waveform with a field intensity of 20 kV and 2 mus  pulse width. The number of pulses ranged from 10 to 500. Evaluation of the starter  cultures was assessed through the analysis of acidifying abilities, survival  fractions, enzymatic activities and proteolysis (RP-HPLC and Cd-ninhydrin) in water  soluble nitrogen extracts following the different attenuation  treatments. Pulsed electric fields significantly affected the general  viability of the cells through a delayed acidification and an inhibition of  enzymatic activity. A study in cheese slurry systems showed that the cultures under  investigation were not able to provide an increased proteolysis levels following PEF  treatment. The results of this study also suggest that optimal PEF treatment varies  for each LAB strain and that the Lactococcus strains do not possess high enough  proteinase and peptidase activities to be beneficial for the acceleration of cheese  ripening.</description><creator>Briggs, Stephanie Sheryl</creator><contributor>Ngadi, M.

To examine the outcome of a 6-month treatment with  carvedilol or metoprolol on peak and submaximal exercise performance and ventilatory  efficiency in patients with heart failure (HF). Methods. 27 patients with HF were randomized to receive either  metoprolol or carvedilol for 6 months and compared with 12 healthy controls. Maximal  exercise capacity was assessed at baseline and after 6 months with a symptom limited  incremental treadmill protocol (RAMP). Submaximal exercise was determined to be the  portion of exercise below a respiratory exchange ratio of 1.0. Peak heart rate (HR),  oxygen uptake (VO2), and ventilatory equivalent for O2 and CO2 were recorded. The  slopes of the VE vs. VCO2, VE vs. VO2 and VE/VCO2 vs. VO2 relationships were  calculated for each subject from submaximal values. Results. Resting HR decreased to similar extent in both  treatment groups. There were no other significant changes in resting hemodynamics or  ventricular function. Peak VO2 and HR decreased significantly in both treatment  groups. Peak VE/VCO2 and submaximal VCO 2 vs. VE slope were not changed  significantly after therapy. Conclusion. beta-blocker treatment with either metoprolol or  carvedilol does not decrease the slope of the VCO2 vs. VE relationship. The present  observations may suggest that the exaggerated ventilatory response of patients with  moderate HF is not mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors.</description><creator>Bridges, Eileen Joan</creator><contributor>Perrault, Helene (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Heart failure -- Chemotherapy</subject><subject>Adrenergic beta blockers</subject><subject>Pulmonary gas exchange</subject><subject>Exercise tests</subject><title>The effects of Ã-blockers on exercise parameters in heart failure /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4q77fr975.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5x21tg037</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z029p5279</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:11:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The application of pulsed electric fields (PEF) in food  processing is a novel technique that requires careful study. In addition, improved  understanding of the effect of PEF parameters on both physical and qualitative  attributes of agrifood products is a requirement for the application and control of  this emerging technology. PEF parameters investigated were pulse widths of 100, 200,  and 300 mus, with electric field strengths of 0.75 and 1.5 kV/cm. The amount of  pulses used for apples was up to 60, whereas up to 120 pulses were used for  potatoes. Initially, apple and potato slices were exposed to various combinations of  PEF parameters in order to evaluate the change in their electrical conductivities as  an indicator of the disruption of the cell membrane. Subsequently, the impact of PEF  on color and texture attributes was studied. In the final set of experiments, PEF  was applied as a pre-treatment in order to accelerate the diffusion of moisture in a  convective air-drying process at 70Â°C. Results regarding the electrical conductivity and the changes in  color revealed the similar effect of applying pulses with 100, 200 and 300 mus of  duration. Increasing the number of pulses and/or the electric field strength  resulted in increased electrical conductivity and discoloration rates of samples.  PEF reduced the compressive strength of apple tissues between 21 to 47%. However,  the compressive strength of potato tissues did not seem to be affected by the  application of PEF. When PEF was applied as a pre-treatment, it caused an increase  of up to 30% in the moisture diffusion coefficients of potatoes. In the case of  apples, PEF pre-treated samples did not show any increase in drying  rates.</description><creator>ArÃ©valo, Patricio</creator><contributor>Ngadi, M. O.

We review the classical intersection theory on a  nonsingular surface, proceed to an overview of types of singularity that may arise,  and then discuss the intersection theory of Snapper-Kleiman, that of Reeve-Tyrrell,  and a modification of the latter that we propose. The intersection theory of Snapper-Kleiman applies to varieties  of any dimension but is restricted to locally principal divisors; that of  Reeve-Tyrrell applies to arbitrary divisors but is restricted to surfaces. Our  modification has the same domain of application as the theory of Reeve-Tyrrell but  simplifies computations: it allows us to prove the theories are all equivalent on  normal surfaces.

The author argues that stereotypes of victimized battered women  emanating from the courts and feminist theory may both prevent women who kill their  partner from making valid claims of self-defence and generally undermine women's  fight against oppression. The author reviews the doctrine of the battered woman  syndrome and its application in the context of self-defence to illustrate how the  courts' treatment of the doctrine conveys a narrow and incomplete depiction of  battered women. An alternative theoretical framework based on battered women's  partial agency is proposed as a means to address feminist theory's simplified  representation of battered women. Various law and policy reform initiatives in the  criminal justice system are explored to assess how the law may validate and promote  battered women's partial agency.</description><creator>Panet-Raymond, Louise</creator><contributor>Sheppard, Colleen (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Family violence -- Law and legislation -- Canada</subject><subject>Abused women -- Legal status, laws, etc -- Canada</subject><subject>Battered woman syndrome</subject><subject>Feminist jurisprudence -- Canada</subject><title>Toward a reconceptualization of battered women : appealing to partial agency</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/np193968d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9593tv743</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hh63sw51d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:11:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The air transport sector is one that is particularly conducive  to market dominance, and therefore to potential abuse thereof. Characterised, for  several decades, by the omnipresence of barriers attributable to the preferential  treatment enjoyed by undertakings under the sponsorship of their respective  governments, European civil air transport has undergone progressive liberalisation  over the years, under the auspices of the European institutions. The object of the present thesis is to assess how the provisions  of Article 82 of the E.C. Treaty have applied to the air transport sector prior and  subsequent to deregulation, and how they remain indispensable, in the wake of  emerging new factors that tend to keep the market of scheduled air services  oligopolistic.</description><creator>Pechberty, SÃ©bastien</creator><contributor>Van Fenema, Peter (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Milde, Michael (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Aeronautics, Commercial -- Law and legislation -- European Union countries</subject><subject>Airlines -- Deregulation -- European Union countries</subject><title>Abuse of a dominant position under Article 82 of the E.C.Treaty, in the air transport sector</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sj139254p.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hh63sw51d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):24825</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
