As a result, signal integrity has become a major issue on which the circuit performance is largely based. Clock jitter is one of the main issues of signal integrity, and it has become one of the most important circuit limitations. While extensive research is on-going to reduce clock jitter in ICs, researchers have also been actively involved in discovering ways to characterize it through applications of new time measurement units, or TMUs for short. A number of TMUs have been designed with resolutions down to the picosecond range, among which the time-to-voltage converter (TVC) is a very popular family of circuits used for making highly precise and accurate time measurements. These circuits are popular due to their excellent linearity properties and their ease of fabrication. Nonetheless, these circuits suffer from metastability issues, limiting the lower end of their measurement range. This thesis first reviews the past TMU circuits, and then presents a TVC architecture that solves the metastability problem. In addition, pipelined operation is added to further increase the throughput of the design. The resolution of the TVC is made adjustable such that it can be used as a stand-alone TMU for different types of applications. The proposed TVC is both verified in simulation and experimentally using a custom designed circuit in a standard 0.18 microm CMOS process supplied by TSMC. Finally, a calibration method is included to further improve the linearity of the overall design.</description><creator>An, Dong, 1981-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Integrated circuits -- Very large scale integration -- Computer simulation.</subject><subject>Signal processing -- Digital techniques -- Computer simulation.</subject><title>A pipelined metastability-independent time-to-voltage converter with adjustable resolution /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pz50h093q.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8p58ph519</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9s161993v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:11:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Optimized slender and short-thick beams are used in building, aircraft and machine structures to increase performance at a lower material cost. A previous work proposes an optimum shape, material and size selection model to design lightweight slender beams under pure bending. In short-thick beams, the transverse shear effects are no longer negligible and impact the choice of the optimum shape. This work extends such an optimum selection model to consider both slender and short-thick beams, by formulating the total beam stiffness design requirement as a combination of shear and bending stiffness. Selection charts are developed to show the impact of design variables, such as shape, size, material and slenderness, on the total beam stiffness. The model of total beam stiffness is validated against computational results from finite element analyses of beam models. A case study demonstrates the use of the selection charts to compare the performance of beams at the conceptual design stage.</description><creator>Amany, Aya Nicole Marie.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Lightweight construction.</subject><subject>Girders -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Shear (Mechanics)</subject><subject>Deformations (Mechanics)</subject><title>Characterization of shear and bending stiffness for optimizing shape and material of lightweight beams</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wd376130z.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9s161993v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9p290f22v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:11:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Ice accretion is a purely unsteady phenomenon that is presently approximated by most icing codes using quasi-steady modeling. The accuracy of ice prediction is thus directly related to the arbitrarily prescribed time span during which the impact of ice growth on both flow and droplets is neglected. The objective of this work is to remove this limitation by implementing a cost-effective unsteady approach. This is done by fully coupling, in time, a diphasic flow (interacting air and droplet particles) with the ice accretion model. The two-phase flow is solved using the Navier-Stokes and Eulerian droplet equations with dual-time stepping in order to improve computational time. The ice shape is either obtained from the conservation of mass and energy within a thin film layer for glaze and mixed icing conditions, or from a mass balance between water droplets impingement and mass flux of ice for rime icing conditions. The iced surface being constantly displaced in time, Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian terms are added to the governing equations to account for mesh movement. Moreover, surface smoothing techniques are developed to prevent degradation of the iced-surface geometric discretization. For rime ice, the numerical results clearly show that the new full unsteady modeling improves the accuracy of ice prediction, compared to the quasi-steady approach, while in addition ensuring time span independence. The applicability of the unsteady icing model for predicting glaze ice accretion is also demonstrated by coupling the diphasic model to the Shallow Water Icing Model. A more rigorous analysis reveals that this model requires the implementation of local surface roughness and that previous quasi-steady validations cannot be carried out using a small number of shots, therefore the need for unsteady simulation.</description><creator>Aliaga Rivera, Cristhian Neil.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Airplanes -- Cold weather operation.</subject><subject>Fluid dynamics -- Data processing.</subject><subject>Airplanes -- Ice prevention.</subject><subject>Fluid dynamics -- Mathematical models.</subject><title>An unsteady multiphase approach to in-flight icing /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9k41zj10d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9p290f22v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4t64gr946</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:11:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis addresses the problem of producing three-dimensional constrained Delaunay triangulated meshes from the sequential two dimensional MRI medical image slices. The approach is to generate the volumetric meshes of the scanned organs as a result of a several low-level tasks: image segmentation, connected component extraction, isosurfacing, image smoothing, mesh decimation and constrained Delaunay tetrahedralization. The proposed methodology produces a portable application that can be easily adapted and extended by researchers to tackle this problem. The application requires very minimal user intervention and can be used either independently or as a pre-processor to an adaptive mesh refinement system. Finite element analysis of the MRI medical data depends heavily on the quality of the mesh representation of the scanned organs. This thesis presents experimental test results that illustrate how the different operations done during the process can affect the quality of the final mesh.</description><creator>Abutalib, Feras Wasef.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Magnetic resonance imaging -- Mathematics.</subject><subject>Image processing -- Mathematics.</subject><subject>Image analysis -- Mathematics.</subject><title>A methodology for applying three dimensional constrained Delaunay tetrahedralization algorithms on MRI medical images /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cr56n473v.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4t64gr946</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wh246w60j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:11:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Conventional Minimum-Variance (MV) channel estimation is affected by two sources of error, namely the finite number of samples used to estimate the covariance matrix and the asymptotic bias due to interference and additive noise. On the other hand, widely linear (WL) filtering has been shown to improve the estimation of improper complex signals. Researchers have recently demonstrated that the application of WL processing principles can significantly improve the performance of subspace-based channel estimation algorithms. However, in contrast to MV estimation algorithms, subspace-based algorithms assume knowledge of the total number of users in the system, and must be coupled with sophisticated user enumeration algorithm at the expense of increased complexity. In this work, in an effort to combine the practical advantages of MV channel estimation algorithms with the performance of WL filters we propose a widely linear version of the MV channel estimator in the context of multicarrier(MC) CDMA systems employing real modulation. We use numerical simulations to demonstrate that the widely linear minimum-variance algorithm yields more accurate channel estimates compared to the conventional MV algorithm. By considering two simplified transmission/reception models, we also show analytically that the widely linear estimator on average reduces both types of error.</description><creator>Abdallah, Saeed.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Wireless communication systems.</subject><subject>Code division multiple access.</subject><title>Widely linear minimum variance channel estimation with application to multicarrier CDMA systems</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dj52w8284.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wh246w60j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7h149t29d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:11:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Perfluorinated carboxylates (PFCAs), sulfonates (PFSs) and perfluoroalkylsulfonamides (PFOSAs) have been detected in whole blood and serum of non-occupationally exposed humans, yet sources of exposure have not been fully elucidated. The objectives of this study were to estimate dietary exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), PFCAs (C7--C 11) and fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylates (FTUCAs) for the general Canadian and Inuit populations prior to the phase-out of perfluorooctyl-sulfonyl production by 3M and voluntary reductions in PFOA emissions under the PFOA stewardship program. PFCs were measured in 65 archived composite food samples prepared for the 1998 Canadian Total Diet Study (TDS) and 68 archived traditional foods from Nunavut using a newly developed methanol extraction combined with a solid phase extraction clean up. Dietary exposure was estimated using food intake data available from studies carried out between 1997 and 1998 in southern Canada and Nunavut. PFCs were detected in eight composite food samples from the Canadian TDS and in 61 traditional food samples. Elevated concentrations of PFCs were found in caribou liver (6.2+/-5.5 ng/g), ringed seal liver (7.7, 10.2 ng/g), polar bear meat (7.0 ng/g), beluga meat (7.0, 5.8 ng/g), luncheon meats (5.02 ng/g), cookies (2.7 ng/g), processed cheese (2.1 ng/g) and peppers (1.8 ng/g). Low levels of total PFCs (&lt;1.5 ng/g) were measured in 41 traditional foods including: meat (caribou, ptarmigan, snow goose, bearded seal, walrus, black duck), berries, and fish (lake trout, arctic char). PFCs were not detected in beverages, unprocessed meats, breads, cereals and fruits from the TDS composite samples analyzed. The ranges of estimated daily exposure to PFCs were between 2 and 59 ng-person-1 and 210 to 610 ng-person-1 for average Canadians and Inuit in Nunavut respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in mean PFC exposure levels for different age and gender groups in the general Canadian population. Inuit men in the 41 to 60 year old age group had statistically significantly higher estimated daily exposure to PFCs (p&lt;0.05) than younger men and women from the same age group. This higher exposure was associated with the consumption of beluga muktuk, caribou liver and bearded seal intestine. Traditional foods contributed a higher percentage to PFC exposure than market foods in all age and gender groups for the Inuit population. In general, caribou meat, arctic char meat and cookies contributed most to dietary exposure for Inuit, with caribou flesh contributing 43 to 75 percent to daily PFC dietary exposure. Dietary exposure for the general Canadian population was associated with the consumption of cakes and cookies, processed cheese, and regular cheese. Levels of dietary exposure to PFCs estimated in these studies do not pose any significant health risk to either population based on current toxicological information.</description><creator>Ostertag, Sonja.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Perfluorooctanoic acid -- Environmental aspects -- Nunavut.</subject><subject>Diet -- Canada.</subject><subject>Inuit -- Food -- Nunavut.</subject><subject>Perfluorooctanoic acid -- Environmental aspects -- Canada.</subject><title>Estimated dietary exposure to perfluorinated compounds in Canada</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ks65hg751.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7h149t29d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:tm70n0134</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:11:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The behaviour of Surf Scoters (Melanitta perspicillata ) was studied on staging grounds in spring of 2006 and compared to behaviour on moulting grounds later that summer. Moulting Surf Scoters have a distinct activity pattern in comparison to those on spring staging grounds. During moult, foraging occurs mainly in the morning and evening, whereas during the spring a similar proportion of birds foraged at all periods of the day. Birds having recently initiated moult foraged significantly less that on staging grounds. However, as moult progressed, this discrepancy disappeared. In addition, we tracked the movements of flightless Surf Scoters using satellite telemetry during the 2006 wing-moult period. Despite their reduced mobility, Surf Scoters are able to swim long distances while flightless. However, the majority of their activities are carried out within small core areas. This study also indicates that satellite telemetry can be used effectively to track the daily movements of wildlife.</description><creator>O'Connor, Mark, 1983-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Molting.</subject><subject>Surf scoter -- Ecology -- Newfoundland and Labrador -- Labrador.</subject><subject>Surf scoter -- Ecology -- Québec (Province) -- Saint Lawrence River Estuary.</subject><title>Surf scoter (Melanitta perspicillata) ecology on spring staging grounds and during the flightless period</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4t64gr95g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tm70n0134</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:w6634720z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:11:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein that maintains telomere. It is activated in greater than 85% of human neoplasms. Traditionally, reactivation of telomerase during tumorigenesis was thought to be required solely to impart an indefinite lifespan. Recently, however, several studies have suggested that telomerase may contribute to tumorigenesis via an additional mechanism that is independent of its role in telomere lengthening. We sought to identify the region(s) of hTERT that contribute to this non-classical role of telomerase. We proposed to identify such regions by their ability to impart a tumorigenic phenotype in ALT cells transduced with activated Ras. Also, we attempted to develop methods to demonstrate that this role is not dependant of telomerase localizing to the telomere. The strategies employed and the progress gained toward each goal is presented in this thesis.</description><creator>Nimmo, Graeme A.

For example, binary phase diagrams are like black boxes, used in the design and simulation of microstructures. They explore a balance of two chemical species, but real alloys have several chemical species, and merit a higher dimensional space. The n-dimensional extension is simplified by dividing the problem into discrete and continuous components. "Discrete" is the identification of behavioural regimes, and their interactions, in a network graph. "Continuous" includes the curvature of boundaries, and the motion through the space. In thermochemical phase spaces, a homogenous alloy is mapped to a particle, whose motion represents the evolution of the alloy. Likewise, non-homogeneous alloys evolve as multidimensional continua. The classical diagrams may also be hybridized. For example, TTT-curves may be treated as extra dimensions of a thermochemical phase space; the resulting hybrid synthesizes microstructural thermodynamics and kinetics.</description><creator>Navarra, Alessandro.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Materials science -- Mathematics.</subject><subject>Mechanics -- Mathematics.</subject><subject>Dimensional analysis.</subject><subject>Phase diagrams.</subject><title>Data structures and n-dimensional mechanics in materials science</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/37720h57t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9g54xn262</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pv63g381p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:11:08Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis characterizes the nutritional implications of climate change impacts on the traditional food system of Inuit in Nunavut, Canada.

Adult offspring of mothers fed a HF diet (30% fat, compared to 5% in control mothers (C)) during the last week of gestation and throughout lactation displayed decreased locomotion in response to an acute amphetamine challenge and decreased behavioral sensitization to repeated amphetamine compared to C animals. These behavioral effects were accompanied by small increases in tyrosine hydroxylase expression in the ventral tegmental area and significant increases in DA and DOPAC content in the NAc, suggesting an elevated DA tone in this target field. In the NAc, there were no significant changes in D1, D2 receptors or DA transporter (DAT) levels between diet groups.

We hypothesized that poor diabetes control is associated with greater hunger suppression, satiation and satiety than good control. We studied 9 T2DM men, after an overnight fast and in response to a 689 kcal mixed meal, twice with or without oral antihyperglycemic agents in a crossover design. Untreated, subjects had higher fasting and postprandial glucose, showed prolonged gastric emptying time and higher thermic effect of food; all factors associated with hunger suppression. Treated, glycemia decreased by 24% and postprandially GLP-1 and PYY3-36 , peptides associated with hunger suppression, were higher than without medication. Thus, no differences were observed in satiation scores between studies.

The fruits were treated with pectin-based coating (coated) or kept as such (control), and stored under different temperatures and relative humidities. Samples of fruits were then tested periodically to note the changes in quality as determined by visual observation, weight loss, respiration rate, color, firmness, pH, titrable acidity (TA), total soluble solids (TSS), chlorophyll content, and decay. Coated fruits displayed retarded color development, higher TA, higher chlorophyll content, greater firmness, lower pH, and lower TSS. Loss in weight and CO 2 evolution were also reduced significantly. The results of this research suggested that pectin-based coating increased the shelf life of mango and cucumber more than 100% without perceptible losses in quality.</description><creator>Moalemiyan, Mitra.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Mango -- Preservation.</subject><subject>Pectin.</subject><subject>Emulsions.</subject><subject>Cucumbers -- Preservation.</subject><title>Optimization and evaluation of a pectin-based composite coating on mango and cucumber</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p26770335.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mg74qq80r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hh63t0559</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:11:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Estrogen acts on maternal circuitry to establish maternal behaviour in otherwise non-maternal rats. The precise mechanisms by which estrogen primes maternal circuitry are unknown; however, the medial preoptic area (MPOA) stimulates maternal behaviour whilst the medial amygdala (MeA) inhibits it. This thesis aimed to address the link between estrogen sensitivity, astroglia and maternal behaviour. Maternal care influences maternal behaviour of female offspring. One mechanism underlying this influence is differential estrogen sensitivity within the MPOA. Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) expression was examined in offspring of High and Low licking/grooming (LG) dams within the MPOA. Enhanced expression ERalpha was limited to the medial preoptic nucleus in offspring of High LG dams and the anteroventral periventricular nucleus in Low LG dams. Adult nulliparous offspring of High and Low LG dams were assessed for maternal responsiveness using the pup sensitization paradigm. Offspring of Highs showed maternal behaviour significantly earlier than offspring of Lows. Brains of pup-exposed and pup-naive High and Low offspring were analyzed for astroglial markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and glutamine synthetase. Pup-naive animals showed more GFAP positive cells within the posteroventral MeA, with no differences within the MPOA and no effect of maternal care. Glutamine synthetase, a glial-derived enzyme necessary for glutamate production, showed greater expression within the MeA of High LG pup-naive animals; with no maternal care differences observed in pup-experienced animals. Thus, long-lasting changes within maternal circuitry established in early life are reflected in regionally specific enhanced estrogen sensitivity and latency to display maternal behaviour, but the effects are less clear with respect to astroglia.</description><creator>McAllister, Kelli.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Astrocytes -- physiology.</subject><subject>Nesting Behavior -- physiology.</subject><subject>Neuronal Plasticity -- physiology.</subject><subject>Maternal Behavior -- physiology.</subject><title>Effect of maternal care on maternal responsiveness and astrocyte plasticity in the medial amygdala and medial preoptic nucleus in the rat</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5h73q074r.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hh63t0559</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4f16c620k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:11:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) and Angiotensin II (AngII) signaling occurs through two distinct receptor superfamilies, the serine/threonine kinase and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Through diametric actions, TGFbeta and AngII regulate various biological responses, including cell proliferation and migration. Previously, we identified the G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), which acts through a negative feedback loop mechanism to terminate Smad signaling. To investigate the impact of TGFbeta-induced GRK2 expression on GPCR signaling, we examined its effect on AngII signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). We show that activation of the TGFbeta signaling cascade results in increased GRK2 expression levels, consequently inhibiting AngII-induced ERK phosphorylation and antagonizing AngII-induced VSMC proliferation and migration. The inhibitory effect of TGFbeta on AngII signaling occurs at the MEK-ERK interface and is abrogated when an anti-sense oligonucleotide directed against GRK2 is used. Thus, we conclude that TGFbeta signaling antagonizes AngII-induced VSMC proliferation and migration through the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation. GRK2 is a key factor in mediating this crosstalk.</description><creator>Mancini, Johanna.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase 2 -- metabolism</subject><subject>Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 2 -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Muscle, Smooth, Vascular -- metabolism.</subject><title>Role of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 in mediating transforming growth factor beta and G protein-coupled receptor signaling and crosstalk mechanisms</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sn00b236m.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4f16c620k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:df65vc227</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:11:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly worldwide. Due to the inadequacy of current pharmacotherapies, novel molecular targets must be sought as potential therapeutic candidates. Furthermore, there is a need for more efficient and cost-effective animal models of this pathology in order to accelerate in vivo investigations. Our laboratory is in possession of human choroidal neovascular membranes which we examined for expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. This expression was characterized in retinal pigment epithelial, vascular endothelial, and fibroblast cells and correlated with patient age. We also looked at the feasibility of creating a rabbit laser-injury model to adequately mimic human neovascular AMD. Our results suggest that anti-COX-2 therapies may be beneficial to some patients with neovascular AMD. Moreover, there is strong potential for the development of clinically relevant choroidal neovascularization in rabbits using the laser-injury technique. This approach may yield a novel, cost-effective AMD model.</description><creator>Maloney, Shawn C.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Macular Degeneration -- pathology.</subject><subject>Disease Models, Animal.</subject><subject>Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors -- therapeutic use.</subject><title>Histopathology of human age-related macular degeneration and the development of a novel animal model</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4j03d358r.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/df65vc227</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pathology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mg74qq811</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:11:14Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are used to detect light that comes from gamma-ray-initiated showers in the earth's atmosphere. The gains of the PMTs are key to determining the amount of light detected and, subsequently, the energy of the incoming gamma ray. In this thesis, a new method of measuring the gain of a PMT is proposed. It relates the PMT gain to the variance of the PMT signal divided by the average current. The new method is mathematically motivated, tested with a series of experiments, and verified using simulations. In addition, it is compared with an existing method of measuring the gain. The new method is shown to be able to predict the gain to within a constant of multiplication. This constant is intrinsic to each PMT and varies from one PMT to another.</description><creator>MacLeod, Audrey, 1983-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Photoelectric multipliers.</subject><title>Measuring the gain of a photomultiplier tube</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3484zm433.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mg74qq811</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ng451n31t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:11:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is an exploration and analysis of what audiences may be learning about medical professionalism from the fictional television (TV) medical drama House MD. Fictional TV medical dramas are an important form of medical narrative in that they are usually created by writers with no medical training. As such, they carry a higher risk of portraying the practice of medicine inaccurately. A review of the scholarly literature reveals that there is a precedent for fictional TV medical dramas to affect viewers' perception of the practice of medicine and health behaviours, and viewers' understanding of medical ethics issues. It also reveals strong empirical evidence that TV medical dramas can affect audience's perceptions of physicians' character. A thorough review of the first two seasons of House MD reveals 20 lessons on professionalism (i.e. lessons on interactions with colleagues and patients, medical ethics, and professional competence) that the title character, Gregory House, is imparting to viewers. All 20 lessons are in direct conflict with established charters on professionalism. Arguments are made for the programme's potential to negatively affect patient access to care, physician-patient relations, interactions between healthcare professionals, and applications to medical school.</description><creator>Lolley, Sarah.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Television -- ethics.</subject><subject>Ethics, Medical.</subject><subject>Physician's Role.</subject><subject>Professional Competence.</subject><title>Medical professionalism and the fictional TV medical drama House MD</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j3860b47c.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ng451n31t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gt54kr68b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:11:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Uveal melanoma is the most common primary malignant intraocular tumour in adults and despite advances in treatment of the primary tumour, the 10-year survival rate remains unchanged. The most frequent cause of death for patients of this disease is liver metastases. Removal of the primary tumour before clinical presentation of metastases, however, has no effect on patient outcome. In order to understand the interactions between single malignant cells or sub-clinical metastases and affected organs, we have successfully developed a novel animal model of uveal melanoma. We utilized the unique properties of green fluorescent protein, a skin-flap in vivo imaging technique, and nude mice to accomplish this goal. The precision of green fluorescent protein imaging has allowed us to observe single cells interacting with organ tissues and reveal that these malignant cells are only capable of surviving in the liver.</description><creator>Logan, Patrick, 1982-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Uveal Neoplasms -- pathology.</subject><subject>Green Fluorescent Proteins -- diagnostic use.</subject><subject>Liver Neoplasms -- secondary.</subject><subject>Melanoma -- pathology.</subject><title>In vivo imaging of liver metastasis using green fluorescent protein labelled human uveal melanoma cells in a mouse model</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dn39x492g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gt54kr68b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pathology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5425kf327</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:11:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this study, lipo-chitooligosaccharide (NodBj-V (C 18:1, MeFuc); LCO) 10-7M, extracted from Bradyrhizobium japonicum, was sprayed on the leaves of soybean cv.

One of the features of an ageing organism is the dramatic increase in the number of cells arrested in the G1 phase, a process known as senescence. It is well established that the senescence phenotype leads to a change in the way cells respond to stress. However, the molecular mechanisms by which these cells cope and/or respond to a variety of environmental challenges remain unknown. In general, cells respond to stress by engaging a variety of mechanisms; one of them is the assembly of cytoplasmic foci known as stress granules (SGs). These entities are considered as part of the survival pathways that are activated at the beginning of any stress to protect key cellular elements which allow a quick recovery if the stress is rapidly removed. However, we do not know whether SGs formation is activated during senescence. In this study, we investigated the formation and the role of SGs in senescent cells exposed to various stresses. We demonstrated that while SGs can assemble in response to oxidative stress (OS) during all the steps leading to senescence activation, their number significantly increases at late stage of senescence. This increase correlates with a rapid decrease in the expression of the cyclin kinase inhibitor p21, one of the main players in the activation of the senescence phenotype. Although the OS-induced recruitment of p21 mRNA to SGs correlates with a significant increase in its half-life, this translocation interferes with p21 translation only at late senescence. This translation inhibition could be explained by the co-recruitment of CUGBP1, a known translation activator during senescence of p21, and p21 mRNA to SGs. Therefore, our data suggest that SGs formation and the reduction in p21 protein levels represent two main events through which senescent cells respond to stress conditions.</description><creator>Lian, Xian Jin, 1968-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Cytoplasmic Granules -- physiology.</subject><subject>Cell Aging -- physiology.</subject><subject>Oxidative Stress -- physiology.</subject><subject>Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Arsenites -- toxicity.</subject><title>Delineating the role of stress granules in senescent cells exposed to external assaults</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xw42nc51f.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7p88cm27k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6m311t09h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:11:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Dysfunction of the vascular endothelium can initiate atherosclerosis. Mechanical forces, particularly wall shear stress (WSS) are believed to cause endothelial dysfunction. Present in vitro cell culture models are often simplified and thus, ignore the wall shear stress spatial gradients inherent in complex geometries. The aim of this project was to study endothelial cell response in an anatomically correct right coronary artery model (RCA) under more physiologically realistic flow conditions. Human Abdominal Aortic Endothelial Cells (HAAECs) were seeded in the lumen of a pre-treated faithful RCA and a straight tubular model. The cells were subjected to steady or non-reversing oscillatory flow (Re=196, alpha=1.82) at a mean physiological flow rate of 20 dynes/cm2 for 8, 12 and 24 hours of flow. The results show that under all flow conditions, the cells became progressively more elongated and aligned. Moreover, differences in endothelial morphology in the inner (myocardial) and outer (pericardial) walls were seen in the inlet region. The morphologic adaptation to steady and oscillatory flow was similar. The results suggest that spatial, not temporal gradients in shear in the inlet region are responsible for the differential endothelial cell response.</description><creator>Lentzakis, Helen.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Vascular endothelium.</subject><subject>Coronary arteries -- Cytology.</subject><subject>Shear (Mechanics)</subject><title>Morphological effects of spatial and temporal gradients of shear in a faithful human right coronary artery cell culture model</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0k225f77t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6m311t09h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vx021j75j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:11:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Drosophila Lasp contains a LIM domain, two nebulin repeats, and a SH3 domain, and exhibits high homology with mammalian Lasp family proteins. Vertebrate Lasp localizes to focal adhesions and to the leading edge of migrating cells and binds filamentous actin. To investigate Drosophila Lasp in vivo, we generated a Lasp null mutant, named Laspl, and showed that Laspl is male sterile. We observed two major functions of Lasp during Drosophila spermatogenesis. First, in the stem cell niche, hub cells fail to localize to the apical end of Drosophila testis in Laspl mutant. Hub cell anchoring is dependent on cell adhesion between cells and extracellular matrix (ECM), which is mediated by integrins. Lasp genetically interacts with betaPS integrin showing complete hub cell mislocalization. This indicates that Lasp is involved in an integrin-dependent process. However, hub cell anchoring is not required for fertility or stem cell maintenance. Secondly, we observe that actin cones, a unique actin structure during spermatid individualization, are perturbed in Laspl. Our data for Lasp expression in actin cones and incomplete individualization indicate that Lasp may play a role in tethering actin to the plasma membrane.</description><creator>Lee, Soojin, 1980-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Spermatogenesis in animals -- Regulation.</subject><subject>Drosophila melanogaster -- Molecular genetics.</subject><subject>Drosophila melanogaster -- Development.</subject><title>Lasp is required for anchoring of the male stem cell niche and spermatid individualization in Drosophila</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3t945v51r.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vx021j75j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:44558h801</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:11:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The structure and association behaviour of poly(styrene-alt-maleic anhydride) (SMA) and poly(styrene-alt-N,N-dimethylpropylamide) (SMI) polymers were studied using molecular modeling.

This was accomplished by characterizing burrow microhabitat, performing behavioural observations, and monitoring winter torpor expression. Among several burrow microhabitat variables related to food availability, predation risk, and hibernacula microclimate, availability of woody debris was the best predictor of burrow site use. Anti-predator benefits associated with availability and use of woody debris are potentially more important than those associated with burrow microhabitat features that are either too spatially invariant (soil temperatures) or too spatially and temporally variant (food sources). Abundance of tree-seeds drastically reduced winter torpor, increasing considerably winter energy consumption, and local density of seed-producing trees was responsible for fine-scale spatial variation in torpor expression. The potential range in winter torpor expression and energy consumption was constrained by microclimate, whereas observed patterns of winter torpor and energy consumption were highly variable and determined primarily by local food abundance.</description><creator>Landry-Cuerrier, Manuelle.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Eastern chipmunk -- Habitations.</subject><subject>Eastern chipmunk -- Hibernation.</subject><subject>Eastern chipmunk -- Habitat.</subject><title>From habitat to energetics : eastern chipmunk burrow microhabitat selection and fine-scale variation in winter torpor expression</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qv33s1192.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2f75rc615</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):17075</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
