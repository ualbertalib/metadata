Given the shifting of public and private spaces in the country's recent history, a "sinister" space has appeared in the collective subconscious, where all that was negated, prohibited and repressed is now (re)surfacing with tremendous energy in a constant probing into the collective memory effectuated from still present traumas without closure. The purpose of this dissertation is to analyse the "social tics" which flourish in various art forms, as well as in the underpinnings of Argentine society, and come from the fact that collective suffering has created a defined present which controls the past, and, inevitably, influences the future. In turn, certain themes thus emerge from subjective and fragmented spaces of enunciation where memory plays a crucial role. In order to do this, I concentrate here on alternative cultural productions to the official propaganda produced during and after the period of dictatorship, paying special attention to women's narratives and testimonies or memoirs of repression. Finally, I undertake an analysis of certain selected cinematographic productions which, like the contemporary literature analysed here, also form part of the movement that demonstrates the need to question Argentine reality---present and past---by foregrounding collective and individual memory in opposition to the generalized trend of amnesia/anaesthesia to point up the very real danger inherent in such "historic amnesia." Taken together, these works reveal the existence of a past that must be recaptured and redeemed, but which, given the existence of the negated and silenced "sinister" space in contemporary reality, forms only a small part of Argentine history still under construction.</description><creator>Giordano, Maria Graciela.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Motion pictures -- Political aspects -- Argentina.</subject><subject>Argentine fiction -- 20th century -- Women authors -- History and criticism.</subject><subject>Argentine fiction -- 20th century -- Political aspects.</subject><subject>Motion pictures -- Argentina.</subject><title>Más allá del trauma colectivo : represión y exilio en la narrativa de mujeres y el cine argentino</title><language>spa</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Maria Graciela Giordano, 2005</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9s161b487.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kh04dt694</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Hispanic Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q524jt03c</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:14Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In the first part of this thesis, building on ideas of R. Pollack and G. Stevens, we present an efficient algorithm for integrating certain rigid analytic functions attached to automorphic forms on definite quaternion algebras. We then apply these methods, in conjunction with the Jacquet-Langlands correspondence and the uniformization theorem of Cerednik-Drinfeld, to the computation p-adic periods of and Heegner points on elliptic curves defined over Q and Q5 which are uniformized by Shimura curves. In part two, we give a new proof of the result, originally proved in unpublished work of Glenn Stevens [27], that every modular eigensymbol of non-critical slope lifts uniquely to a rigid-analytic distribution-valued eigensymbol. The proof is algorithmic and facilitates the efficient calculation of certain p-adic integrals. This has applications to the calculation of Stark-Heegner points on elliptic curves defined over Q as well as over certain imaginary quadratic fields.</description><creator>Greenberg, Matthew.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Mathematics.</subject><title>Heegner points and rigid analytic modular forms</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Matthew Greenberg, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/44558j33v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q524jt03c</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hm50tw74k</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:14Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Visualization and quantitative oxidation kinetic experiments on 100 g samples of Pb-As at 600°C; thermal analysis and phase-equilibrium measurements of Pb-PbO-As2O3 samples under argon over the temperature range of 420°C to 875°C; computational thermodynamic solution modeling; and phase diagram and equilibrium calculations using FACTSage(TM) were performed to elaborate the poorly documented thermodynamics of the slags in the lead softening stage in the pyrometallurgical refining of lead. In the softening stage, the minor element impurities: arsenic, antimony and tin are removed from lead bullion by oxidation and are transferred to a skimmable oxide slag phase. It was found that optimizing an ionic molten oxide solution model that was conceptualized to contain Pb2+ and O2- with AsO3-4 and AsO3-3 ions, or with SbO3-4 and SbO3-3 ions in the respective PbO rich regions of the Pb-As-O and the Pb-Sb-O systems, was able to accurately reproduce the measured and published thermodynamic data. It was also found that the subsystems in the PbO-As2O 3-As2O5 and PbO-Sb2O3-Sb 2O5 systems showed small deviation from the ideal ionic solution model and small magnitude excess Gibbs energy parameters were sufficient to fit the predicted liquidus curves to the experimental measurements. Arsenic in the +3 and +5 oxidation states was measured in the PbO rich region of the Pb-As-O liquid solution in the temperature range of 420°C to 875°C. The variability in the ratio of trivalent arsenic to the total arsenic content, as well as the complex variation of arsenic distribution between metal and oxide phases found strong interaction between the lead, arsenic and oxygen atoms at the 3PbO to 1AS2O3 molar ratio thus suggesting a short range ordering corresponding to the formation of AsO3-3 groupings, and indicating that the Pb3(AsO3) 2(l) species was likely to be present in the PbO rich region of the Pb-As-O system and contributing to an understanding of the Pb-As-O liquid oxide structure. Also, two new compounds (Pb3(AsO3) 2(s), Pb2AsO4(s)) were identified in the Pb-PbO-As 2O3 quenched samples via wavelength-dispersive spectrometry using the electron microprobe. The present work has application in commercial oxygen partial lead softening (OPLS), as uniquely practiced at Teck Cominco Ltd., British Columbia. There, pure oxygen gas is injected into the bath of impure bullion through a number of submerged lances in order to oxidize only part of the arsenic, antimony and tin into a slag phase. For such an operating practice, it was concluded from the visualization and quantitative oxidation experiments that the formation of solid oxides as the product of oxidation produced a physical barrier to the progress of oxidation and resulted in the commercially observed, highly-problematic, process initiation issues. When the product was liquid, there was much less of a barrier to rapid oxygen mass transfer to the minor element impurities and the softening reactions were easy to initiate. Such a change in the physical state of the products of oxidation was correlated to the optimized ternary Pb-As-O and Pb-Sb-O phase diagrams. A current point of interest in partial lead softening is to increase the arsenic content of the slag phase. Arsenic distribution between lead bullion and slag calculated by the optimized solution model of the Pb-As-O system suggests that this can be achieved in a counter-current contacting of the slag and bullion.</description><creator>Firoozi, Sadegh.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</subject><title>Thermodynamics and mechanisms of lead softening</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Sadegh Firoozi, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dz010v204.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hm50tw74k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ms35td42b</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The prevalence of allergic diseases is increasing worldwide for unclear reasons. This sudden widespread increase, particularly in children, suggests causes that are not due to genetic makeup of individuals, but rather a change in environment and lifestyle factors. Growing epidemiological and immunological evidence supports the hygiene hypothesis, which states that decreased exposure to immune stimulatinginfections in early childhood is the cause of the rise in allergic diseases. Studies have shown that even bacterial components such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can have a protective effect. The receptor for LPS is Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), an innate immunological receptor, which may play an essential role in regulation of allergic disease. We investigated the expression of TLR4 in the nasal mucosa of allergic and non-allergic children and adults, the effects of LPS on allergic inflammation and the regulation of TLR4 expression. We hypothesized that LPS, through TLR4, could regulate allergic inflammation and that long-term allergic inflammation would limit these responses. Children and adults undergoing nasal surgery were recruited from the local hospitals. Nasal biopsies from the patients were explanted and cultured ex vivo with allergen and LPS. LPS could prevent allergen-induced Th2 cytokine production and inflammatory cell increases in explants from atopic children; this was through induction of Th1 cytokines and IL-10. TLR4 was also detected on CD4+CD25+ T cells. LPS did not provide the same protection in adults. Adults, especially atopic subjects, had less TLR4 immunopositive cells; hence, their reduced responsiveness to LPS. This suggests that factors could downregulate TLR4 in allergic adults. The U-937 monocytic cell line was used as an in vitro model to study the regulation of TLR4 by interleukin-4 (IL-4), a T-helper type 2 (Th2) cytokine involved in allergic inflammation. U-937 cells cultured with IL-4 had decreased LPS responsiveness, TLR4 protein surface expression, TLR4 mRNA expression and transcriptional activity of the upstream region of TLR4. This effect was tyrosine kinase and STAT6 dependent. A STAT6 binding site was determined in an area of the TLR4 gene necessary to mediate IL-4's inhibitory effects on TLR4 transcription. IL-4 was also determined to reduce TLR4 expression in PBMCs, especially in CD4+ T cells purified from the blood of children. As predicted in epidemiological studies and animal studies, LPS was shown to provide anti-inflammatory effects against allergen in human nasal tissue. LPS may directly stimulate regulatory T cells (CD25+CD4+) to produce anti-inflammatory cytokine production. The effects of LPS exposure may be lost due to reduced expression of TLR4 by inflammatory cells, and this may be caused by the allergic inflammation itself. Therefore, development of allergic inflammation can down-regulate anti-inflammatory mechanisms and promote long term chronic inflammation.</description><creator>Fiset, Pierre-Olivier.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</subject><title>Expression and regulation of Toll-like receptor 4 in allergic disease</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Pierre-Olivier Fiset, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4t64gs45g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ms35td42b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pathology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5712mc151</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>3',5"-aminoglycoside O-phosphotransferase type IIIa (APH(3')-IIIa) is an enzyme produced by pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria such as Enterococci and Staphylococci. It is capable of conferring resistance to a broad range of clinically important aminoglycoside antibiotics via the ATP-dependent addition of a phosphate to specific hydroxyl groups on the drug. The phosphorylated amino-glycoside loses its toxic effects due to reduced affinity for its target, the A-site of 30S ribosome. Crystal structures of several ternary complexes have been elucidated in an effort to understand the promiscuity of substrate recognition by APH(3')-IIIa. They are APH(3')-IIIa bound with ADP and kanamycin or neomycin to resolutions of 2.4 A and 2.7 A, respectively, as well as the structures of APH(3')-IIIa bound with AMPPNP and butirosin or 5"-monophosphorylated butirosin to resolutions of 2.4 A and 2.7 A, respectively. These structures reveal that the basis for this enzyme's broad substrate spectrum is the presence of a flexible antibiotic-binding loop and a versatile antibiotic-binding pocket composed of three sub-sites. A comparison of the A-site of the bacterial ribosome and APH(3')-IIIa shows a high degree of similarity in the pattern of hydrogen bonds to the aminoglycoside. However, they differ in their van der Waals interactions with the substrate, suggesting a potential strategy for the design of novel antibiotics and adjuvants. Another strategy for overcoming antibiotic resistance resulting from the effects of APH(3')-IIIa is the development of inhibitors that target the nucleotide-binding pocket of the enzyme. It has been shown that APH(3')-IIIa possess striking structural and functional similarity to eukaryotic protein kinases (ePKs). In particular, APH(3')-IIIa is sensitive to several ATP-competitive protein kinase inhibitors. To aid the design of ligands with high specificity to the nucleotide-binding pocket of APH(3')-IIIa, the crystal structure of APH(3')-IIIa bound with CKI-7, a casein kinase 1 inhibitor, has also been determined to 2.5 A resolution. Distinct features can be identified upon detailed comparisons between CKI-7-bound and nucleotide-bound APH(3')-IIIa and isoquinolinesulfonainide-bound ePKs. It is hoped that these results will contribute to the design of compounds that will allow aminoglycoside antibiotics to remain useful components of the antibacterial armamentarium.</description><creator>Fong, Desiree Ho-Chi.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><title>Structural basis of ligand binding to 3',5'' -aminoglycoside O-phosphotransferase type IIIa</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Desiree Ho-Chi Fong, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vt150p330.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5712mc151</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z603r277m</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In order to close the gap that exists between the research areas of mathematics anxiety and mathematics learning, this study examined cognitive, metacognitive, and affective aspects of mathematics anxiety as well as students' mathematics performance and competence. One hundred and five grade 9 students, 51 males and 54 females, from two high schools in the same school board provided data on current and past final grades and anxiety measures, both general and specific to mathematics anxiety. A subset of 40 students was selected based on either high or low mathematics anxiety, and verbal protocols were collected while they solved six mathematical problems. Students ranked themselves and teachers ranked their students on how confident they felt about solving each problem. Two sets of marks were assigned to students' performance, one based on their written work only and the other one also taking into account knowledge evidenced from their verbalizations. As predicted, the more mathematics-anxious students showed greater awareness of their mathematical knowledge or the lack thereof, making significantly more coded statements for four out of the six variables that implied greater awareness. High-anxious students were less likely to consider continuing their mathematical education. Teachers overestimated their students' performance, while students underestimated their knowledge level, but more closely estimated the mark they would receive on a test regardless of anxiety level. Given that mathematics-anxious students seem aware of their lack of knowledge, any treatment of mathematics anxiety needs to include teaching not only mathematical knowledge, but also skills such as monitoring and reflecting about application of such knowledge to the solution process.</description><creator>Franz, Erika Katharina Elizabeth.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Mathematics -- Study and teaching -- Psychological aspects.</subject><subject>Anxiety.</subject><title>Knowing about not knowing : a cognitive view of mathematics anxiety</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Erika Katharina Elizabeth Franz, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3j3336604.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z603r277m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p5547w672</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Wild plant resources are harvested and managed by people in a variety of land-uses but few studies examine the interactions of landscape dynamics and the use and availability of wild plant resources. I address this question using a case study of common property lands with a history of community forestry and traditional shifting cultivation. Specifically I ask: What is the perceived importance of plant resources obtained in agricultural and forest environments? Have forest and agricultural land-use/land covers changed? How do landscape changes, and in particular shorter fallow times, influence the availability and use of plant resources? The perceived importance of wild plant resources was studied using free-listing and ranking exercises with focus groups of men and women. Remote sensing and interviews served to analyse landscape dynamics (1976-2000) and to identify local forest conservation regulations. The impact of shorter fallow times on the availability of forage and firewood in agricultural fields was assessed by sampling 26 fields derived from short to long fallows, while a household survey served to characterize patterns of firewood collection. Men attributed highest importance to commercial forest products, while resources most valued by women were domestic resources obtained in a variety of environments. High rates of forest retention were observed; conservation was focused on forests with high densities of commercial products. The agricultural zones shifted from a mosaic of diverse successional stages to a homogeneous landscape dominated by younger fallows and shorter fallow periods; these changes led to reductions in the availability of firewood and some forage species. Firewood collection was related to accessibility; areas with the least amount of firewood available (short-fallow cycles and low forest cover) experienced the highest collection pressure. The findings demonstrate that indigenous territories can be very dynamic, even when rates of forest conservation are high, and that changes in land-use and landscape structure have important implications for the availability and use of wild plant resources. A conceptual model linking landscape dynamics to wild plant use is proposed and the significance of the results for community-based conservation initiatives is discussed.</description><creator>Dalle, Sarah Paule.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Mayas -- Ethnobotany -- Mexico -- Quintana Roo (State).</subject><subject>Ejidos -- Mexico -- Quintana Roo (State).</subject><subject>Forest conservation -- Mexico -- Quintana Roo (State) -- Citizen participation.</subject><subject>Shifting cultivation -- Mexico -- Quintana Roo (State).</subject><title>Landscape dynamics and management of wild plant resources in shifting cultivation systems : a case study from a forest ejido in the Maya zone of Quintana Roo, Mexico</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Sarah Paule Dalle, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1z40kz12w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p5547w672</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Plant Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1544bt575</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The research undertaken in this thesis includes microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), synthesis, and the investigation of the scale-up of the microwave-assisted processes with the numerical aid. The main goal of this research is to study the various problems associated with the scale-up of the microwave-assisted extraction and synthesis processes. Laboratory studies were carried out to investigate the microwave-assisted extraction of known components from peppermint leaves and American ginseng. Various factors that influence the extraction processes were studied. Microwave-assisted extraction method was compared with conventional heating and room temperature extraction methods on the extraction of ginsenosides from American ginseng. Microwave-assisted extraction method was determined to have higher extraction rate than both room temperature extraction and reflux temperature extraction using hotplate heating indicating that there is acceleration factor in enhancing the extraction rate beyond the temperature influence. In the study of synthesizing n-butyl paraben, microwave-assisted synthesis was observed to greatly increase the yield of n-butyl paraben in much shorter period of time compared to the classic synthesis method. A transition state theory was proposed to explain this rate enhancement. The study of the synthesis of parabens with different alcohol and the influencing factors on the synthesis of n-butyl paraben yield were also studied. A visualization method was developed to determine the microwave distribution in a domestic microwave cavity. The method uses gypsum plate as carrier and cobalt chloride as indictor. A simulation program was developed using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) approach and written in C programming language. The program was proved to be very versatile in different type of cavity simulation. Not only cavities with different dimensions and geometrical designs can be simulated, multiple magnetrons and various ways of magnetron placement can also be integrated into the simulation program. The detailed power distribution can be visualized in a 3-D plot, and the power distribution in each layer can be analyzed using the simulation result. The power distribution information will be very useful and necessary before any real equipment development.</description><creator>Dai, Jianming.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>American ginseng -- Analysis.</subject><subject>Extraction (Chemistry)</subject><subject>Organic compounds -- Synthesis.</subject><subject>Microwave heating -- Industrial applications.</subject><subject>Peppermint -- Analysis.</subject><title>Microwave-assisted extraction and synthesis studies and the scale-up study with the aid of FDTD simulation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Jianming Dai, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mg74qr33k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1544bt575</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Bioresource Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z603r278w</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis consists of three essays in monetary economics and international macroeconomics. Chapter one uses Canadian data to evaluate the performance of money growth targeting and inflation targeting policy rules, especially when they react to asset price changes. There are three important findings. First, estimates of the policy rules consistent with both regimes provide evidence that the Bank of Canada has systematically reacted to stock price bubbles and exchange rate changes. Second, a counterfactual experiment reveals that, the high inflation of the 1970s and early 1980s could have been avoided if the Bank of Canada had responded more strongly to inflation and growth in aggregate demand. Third, simulation experiments yielded two important results: For both the money growth targeting and inflation targeting policy rules, it is always desirable to react to changes in exchange rates and stock price bubbles: Contrary to established findings, the results indicate that the money growth targeting policy rules are more efficient than the inflation targeting policy rules. Chapter two uses data on Ghana to test the validity of the intertemporal model of current account that allows for external shocks in the form of variable interest rates and exchange rates, and the existence of capital controls. We find that, irrespective of the degree of capital control, the basic model fails to predict the dynamics of the actual current account. However, we find that extending the model to capture variations in interest rates and exchange rates better explains the path of the actual current account balances only during the liberalized regime. When the model was adjusted to allow for credit constraints, there was some support for the proposition that the presence of capital controls prevented economic agents in Ghana to smooth their consumption path during the control regime. Chapter three investigates the effect of trading block on Tanzania's bilateral trade. Using a fixed effects estimation technique, the results revealed that the East African Community (EAC) and the European Union (EU) have had significant positive effects on Tanzania's bilateral trade. We also find that there is a significant intra-trade relationship between Tanzania and its major trading partners in the manufacturing sector.</description><creator>Darku, Alexander Bilson.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Money.</subject><subject>Monetary policy.</subject><subject>Fiscal policy.</subject><subject>Macroeconomics.</subject><title>Essays in monetary economics and international macroeconomics</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Alexander Bilson Darku, 2005</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3x816r76v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z603r278w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Economics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z029p8952</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study explores ethnic identity and ethnic culture and the role they play in the lives of young men in gangs. Fifty male youths between the ages of 14 and 20 were interviewed. These youths were of French (10), Haitian (10), Jamaican (10), and Latino (10) ethnicity. Ten youths from a variety of other ethnic backgrounds were also interviewed. All youths were confined in maximum-security detention centers in Montreal, Canada. Participatory observation of males who were full-fledged gang members or affiliated with gang members was conducted at these centers. Analysis for this dissertation was conducted following the Birmingham School perspective and Herbert Gans's theory of symbolic ethnicity. The Birmingham School perspective is used to explore symbolic meaning behind specific styles [i.e. hairstyles, image, demeanor] and the degree to which they are interrelated with these young men's ethnic culture and ethnic identity, and how these various styles are signifiers of resistance or belonging. Herbert Gans's conception of symbolic ethnicity is used to explore ethno-cultural identity and its meaning in gang life. The research shows that these gangs (the French, Haitian, Jamaican, Latino, and youths from a variety of other ethnic backgrounds) are organized along racial and ethnic lines. Latinos were most likely to explicitly identify preservation of ethnic identity and ethnic culture as important components of gang life. This research is exploratory and identifies important issues for further investigation.

The proposed stochastic security criteria, snake use of probabilistic measures of the expected bald not served or of the loss-of-load probability associated with the random failures of pre-selected sets of generators, lines as well as load disturbances. We snow that by economically penalizing the operation of the market through the associated demand-side costs of involuntary load shedding, the reserve service requirements are determined implicity, thus removing the needs for specifing any a priori reserve requirements. Under this approach, the market-clearing problem gains in flexibility as it can balance file respective expected costs of: (i) the pre-contingency preventive security control actions that include unit commitment, generation and load dispatch as well as reserve scheduling; (ii) the post-contingency corrective actions that deploy reserves through further unit, commitment decisions and load and generation re-dispatch; and, (iii) any post-contingency involuntary load shedding decisions. Case studies illustrate that electricity market-clearing with stochastic security leads to non-negligible economic savings for society; while it can still ensure that consumers benefit from a secure supply of electricity given how they value load shedding. We derive theoretical results pertaining to the prices of energy and security corresponding to the optimal schedules of the market-clearing process. The key result of this analysis establishes that involuntary load shedding is used after a contingency if and only if the expected marginal costs of scheduling reserves and deploying them are greater than the expected marginal costs of load shedding. We then extend the model of electricity market-clearing with stochastic security by proposing a short-term electricity market-clearing formulation capable of accounting for non-dispatchable and intermittent power generation sources like wind power. We show how the electricity market-clearing model can take into account uncertainties in the next day/hours wind power generation predictions as well as those of the demand. Also, We demonstrate how the market-clearing formulation can integrate the scheduling of a large-scale centralized energy storage infrastructure. Finally we define rigorously the concept of the set of umbrella, contingencies for security-constrained optimal power flow problems, a class of power system scheduling problems to which market-clearing with stochastic: security belongs. We propose an identification method to identify the members of this set by making use of the vector norms of the Lagrange multipliers associated with the post-contingency power balance relations. We suggest a heuristic contingency ranking rule based on those vector norms, and we argue that, the proposed identification rule and ranking method can be of use to system operators when specifying reduced sets of contingencies for security-constrained market-clearing problems.</description><creator>Bouffard, François.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Electricity market-clearing with stochastic security</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© François Bouffard, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/th83m359h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h989r750n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mp48sj06f</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis, we present an approach to finding a procedural representation of a texture to replicate a given texture image which we call image-based procedural texture matching. Procedural representations are frequently used for many aspects of computer generated imagery, however, the ability to use procedural textures is limited by the difficulty inherent in finding a suitable procedural representation to match a desired texture. More importantly, the process of determining an appropriate set of parameters necessary to approximate the sample texture is a difficult task for a graphic artist. The textural characteristics of many real world objects change over time, so we are therefore interested in how textured objects in a graphical animation could also be made to change automatically. We would like this automatic texture transformation to be based on different texture samples in a time-dependant manner. This notion, which is a natural extension of procedural texture matching, involves the creation of a smoothly varying sequence of texture images, while allowing the graphic artist to control various characteristics of the texture sequence. Given a library of procedural textures, our approach uses a perceptually motivated texture similarity measure to identify which procedural textures in the library may produce a suitable match. Our work assumes that at least one procedural texture in the library is capable of approximating the desired texture. Because exhaustive search of all of the parameter combinations for each procedural texture is not computationally feasible, we perform a two-stage search on the candidate procedural textures. First, a global search is performed over pre-computed samples from the given procedural texture to locate promising parameter settings. Secondly, these parameter settings are optimised using a local search method to refine the match to the desired texture. The characteristics of a procedural texture generally do not vary uniformly for uniform parameter changes. That is, in some areas of the parameter domain of a procedural texture (the set of all valid parameter settings for the given procedural texture) small changes may produce large variations in the resulting texture, while in other areas the same changes may produce no variation at all. In this thesis, we present an adaptive random sampling algorithm which captures the texture range (the set of all images a procedural texture can produce) of a procedural texture by maintaining a sampling density which is consistent with the amount of change occurring in that region of the parameter domain. Texture transformations may not always be contained to a single procedural texture, and we therefore describe an approach to finding transitional points from one procedural texture to another. We present an algorithm for finding a path through the texture space formed from combining the texture range of the relevant procedural textures and their transitional points. Several examples of image-based texture matching, and texture transformations are shown. Finally, potential limitations of this work as well as future directions are discussed.</description><creator>Bourque, Eric.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Image-based procedural texture matching and transformation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Eric Bourque, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8g84mr63j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mp48sj06f</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x920g191t</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The emphasis on segmentation and reduction in atomistic thinking has had a huge impact on the way that we educate. This increasingly questioned worldview encourages fragmentation, isolation and feelings of alienation and powerlessness, believed to contribute to anger, depression, substance abuse, aggression, violence and at times suicide among our youth. We urgently need to find and implement solutions. A new emerging paradigm in education, referred to as holistic education, is surfacing as a possible solution. This dissertation is based on my qualitative research study of a soul-centered, holistically-oriented private elementary school in Texas---the Robert Muller School of Fairview, Texas. (Robert Muller was past Assistant Secretary-General of the U.N.) The focus of my inquiry is the holistic nature of the World Core Curriculum for Global Education Synthesis, a framework that emphasizes both peace and global education. It includes the school's eclectic philosophy, mission statement, setting, community-building activities and integrated curriculum from a holistic, whole-person perspective that includes the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual development of the child. Also examined is how the school's holistic 'Model of School Development' attempts to construct a culture of peace and non-violence. Special attention is given to (1) Peace Education, with its emphasis on healing emotional afflictions and on developing communication, problem-solving and conflict resolution skills appropriate for living non-violently and democratically, and (2) Global Education, with its emphasis on multi-cultural and planetary/earth relationships. The transformational effects of the program on students, teachers and parents and the extent to which these programs correspond to theoretical models of educating for peace and global education are examined as well. An evaluation of the strengths and concerns of the school, from the perspective of the teachers and parents, is also given. The dissertation concludes with a brief response to seven research questions, the last being whether or not the school's holistic "Model of School Development" can be implemented in our private schools and public school systems.</description><creator>Brooks, Barbara H.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Holistic education.</subject><subject>International education.</subject><subject>Peace -- Study and teaching -- Texas.</subject><title>Educating for a culture of peace through holistic education : a case study of the Robert Muller School of Fairview, Texas</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Barbara H.

When fed on bacteria that synthesize UQ the mutants are viable but display slow development, behaviours and aging. However, they arrest development when fed on UQ synthesis-deficient bacteria. I have taken a genetic suppressor approach to investigate the causes of the various phenotypes as well as of the dietary requirements of the clk-1 mutants. We identified two classes of mutants that suppress the defecation phenotypes of clk-1. All of these "dsc" mutants suppress the lengthened cycle of clk-1. Class I mutants also restore the ability to react normally to changes in temperature whereas the Class II mutants do not. The characterization of the Class I mutants suggests that part of the phenotype of clk-1 is due to an alteration of lipid metabolism, likely the level of lipid or lipoprotein oxidation. dsc-4 encodes the worm homolog of the Microsomal Triglyceride Transfer Protein (MTP), a protein required for the formation of low density lipoproteins (LDL) in vertebrates, and whose absence in people leads to abetalipoproteinemia. dsc-3 appears to be allelic to tat-2, which encodes a type IV P-type ATPase that is related to a family of human aminophospholipid transporters that includes ATP8B1/FIC1, whose inactivation results in cholestatic liver disease. dsc-3 and dsc-4 appear to affect distinct aspects of lipid metabolism. A general link between the Class II mutants and clk-1 remains elusive. dsc-1, a Class II gene, encodes a paired-like homeodomain transcription factor that is necessary for the GABA sensitivity of enteric muscles. We also identified 9 clk-1(e2519)-specific suppressors, which suppress most Clk phenotypes, including their requirement for dietary UQ. Our analysis of these suppressors reveals that it is the lack of UQ rather than the presence of DMQ that is responsible for most phenotypes. In addition, they allowed us to show that most Clk phenotypes can be uncoupled from each other. We cloned six suppressors and all encode missense tRNA(Glu) suppressor genes. To my knowledge, these represent the first missense tRNA suppressors identified in any metazoan.</description><creator>Branicky, Robyn.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Caenorhabditis elegans -- Molecular genetics.</subject><subject>Ubiquinones.</subject><title>Suppressor analysis of the clk-1 mutants of Caenorhabditis elegans</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Robyn Branicky, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zp38wh77z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hd76s447k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cv43p2365</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We review the lore of effective field theories as a background to hierarchy problems in general and the cosmological constant problem in particular. We outline some of the attempted four-dimensional solutions to the cosmological con stant problem and conclude that ones based upon the usual assumptions of four-dimensiona lfield theory typically do not work. We argue that one way to relax the assumptions is to seek solutions to the cosmological constant problem which rely on the presence of extra dimensions. We explicitly exhibit that standard compactification techniques fail to solve the cosmological constant problem because they reduce the problem to a four-dimensional one. We argue that brave-world models may be helpful in solving the cosmological constant problem because standard model loops contribute to the tension and not to the vacuum energy directly, and can fulfill our stated aim of constructing a model which uses the extra dimensions to mitigate the cosmological constant problem. We identify necessary (not sufficient) properties a theory must possess to successfully use this observation. These properties are: a scaling symmetry encoded in a dilaton-like scalar, and bulk supersymmetry. We therefore investigate supersymmetric six-dimensional brave-world models. Our models are imbedded within a 6D supergravity that has many of the features of realistic string models. We explicitly show that the compactification of the 6D theory has many of the same features as string compactifications, including flat four-dimensional space, chiral fermions, rnoduli, moduli-stabilisation using fluxes, and gluino condensation. We show that by calculating the non-perturbative correction to the superpotential and loop-corrections to the Kahler function that a meta-stable deSitter vacuum can be found. The vacuum energy can be tuned to be ~ 10-6 M4Planck . We find that all solutions of the supergravity equations of motion, under a symmetry ansatz, have flat braves. This implies that this property is independent of some of the details of the braves, such as their tensions. The source of the branes' flatness is the required classical scaling symmetry of the action. We consider whether this class of models may provide a solution to the cosmological constant problem within the large extra dimensions scenario, in which the radius r ~ 0.1mm, and in which the standard-model fields are trapped on a 3-brave. We conclude that it may be possible to produce naturally a cosmological constant that is of order r -4 ~ (10-3eV)4 due to loops because the supersymmetry-breaking scale in the bulk is MSUSY ~ r-1; although there remains a great deal of work to be done. We comment on recent extensions to cosmological backgrounds. Further work within these models is outlined, including higher-dimensional models, use of effective field-theory techniques in theories with sharp boundaries, and the treatment of quantum corrections.</description><creator>Aghababaie, Yashar.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Physics, Theory.</subject><title>Six-dimensional supergravity braneworlds and the cosmological constant</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Yashar Aghababaie, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sn00b294h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cv43p2365</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:028711301</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Three new quantitative Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic methods were developed for the analysis of edible oils: two procedures to measure free fatty acids (FFA) and one to measure moisture (H2O), the latter two methods ultimately being automated and implemented on an auto-sampler equipped FTIR spectrometer. The methods developed for FFA determination both convert FFAs to their carboxylate salts by means of acid/base reaction without causing oil saponification, one approach using 1-propanol, an oil-miscible solvent, and the other using methanol, an oil-immiscible solvent into which the FFA salts are extracted. The first method involves splitting oil samples into two halves, with one half treated with propanol containing base and the other half with propanol only. The spectra of each half is collected and a differential spectrum obtained, from which quantization is performed. The methanol procedure simply involves extracting FFA into methanol containing a weak base and quantitating the FFA salts produced. Both FFA methods determine the FFA content by measuring the v (COO-) absorbance at ~1570 cm-1 relative to a reference wavelength of 1820 cm-1 from a differential spectrum relative to the solvent, the extraction procedure being superior in terms of both speed and sensitivity, being able to measure FFA levels down to ~0.001%. The method developed for moisture determination involves extracting water in edible oils into dry acetonitrile and then quantitating it by measuring the absorbance of the OH stretching band (3629 cm-1) and/or the HOH bending band (1631 cm -1). All three methods were validated by standard addition experiments, evaluated for potential interferences, and, in the case of FFA determination, compared to the performance of AOCS official methods. The results indicated that the extraction-based procedures were superior to conventional wet chemical methods in both sensitivity and reproducibility. The FFA and H2O extraction procedures were subsequently automated by connecting an auto-sampler to the FTIR spectrometer and developing procedures and software algorithms to enable the analysis of up to 100 samples/h. The methods developed and implemented are a substantive improvement over conventional methods for the analysis of FFA and H2O in edible oils and provide a means by which QC and process laboratories can analyze large volumes of edible oils for these two important parameters.</description><creator>Al-Alawi, Ahmed Ali.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Fatty acids.</subject><subject>Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.</subject><subject>Oils and fats, Edible -- Analysis.</subject><title>Novel approaches to automated quality control analyses of edible oils by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy : determination of free fatty acid and moisture content</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Ahmed Ali Al-Alawi, 2005</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/df65vc90c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/028711301</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k3569845p</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The study presented in this dissertation focusses on the analysis of novices' trajectories in learning genres of their profession, engineering. The goals of the study are: (a) to refine the current understanding of what constitutes professional genre knowledge and of how novices learn and use genres of professional communication, and (b) to test the effectiveness of the suggested pedagogy for an Engineering Communication course. This qualitative longitudinal exploration includes ten case studies that span eight years and trace the participants' trajectories through the university and workplaces. I use a combination of three theoretical perspectives---Rhetorical Genre Studies, Activity Theory, and situated learning---as a lens for the analysis of novices' learning trajectories on their way to becoming professional communicators. The study demonstrates that in addition to the knowledge of genre conventions and understanding of an audience's expectations, genre knowledge is a result of a summative effect of such ingredients accumulated from different sources at different time periods as (a) cultural capital, (b) domain content expertise, (c) the novice's understanding of the improvisational qualities of genre, (d) agency, as reflected in the novice's ability to both seize and create kairotic moments in the chronological flux of time and enact genres in the ways that are recognizable by the community of practice, (e) formal education, (f) workplace experiences, and (g) private intention. The study indicates that the ingredients of genre knowledge accumulated in one context may be used in another, that is, that rhetorical strategy may be portable, thus allowing novices to adapt genres learned elsewhere to a new rhetorical situation. The study also shows that communication practices can be successfully taught outside of local contexts, for example, in the academic classroom. In addition I draw pedagogical implications of the inquiry for the communication classroom; for example, that communication instructors need to extend their pedagogies beyond teaching genre conventions and audience awareness and provide classroom contexts that would allow students to develop the understanding of genre as allowing for flexibility and educated intervention. The study also shows that the timing of the offering of domain-specific communication courses is crucial for the students to be able to develop the sense of connections among communication courses, subject matter courses, and professional practice.</description><creator>Artemeva, Natalia.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Communication in engineering.</subject><subject>Discourse analysis.</subject><subject>Engineering -- Study and teaching.</subject><subject>Rhetoric.</subject><title>Becoming an engineering communicator : a study of novices' trajectories in learning genres of their profession</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Natalia Artemeva, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sq87bz600.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k3569845p</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Integrated Studies in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3j333661d</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis deals with the assessment of seismic accelerations in buildings and the seismic analysis of components installed on building rooftops, with special focus on operational telecommunition towers during and after earthquake shaking. First, acceleration data recorded during the 1999 Chi Chi earthquake from 11 instrumented buildings located in Taiwan were studied. Fundamental building periods were extracted by system identification and compared to those evaluated according to the equations proposed in the 2005 edition of the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC). Next, rooftop acceleration spectra and time histories were evaluated using 3-D finite element building models; three models of instrumented buildings were calibrated using accelerograms from the Chi Chi earthquake and the fourth model is a building located in downtown Montreal. The building models were subjected to 44 historical strong motion accelerograms and 30 synthetic accelerograms compatible with the target uniform hazard spectra specified in NBCC 2005 for Montreal. Based on both the experimental and numerical results, a maximum rooftop acceleration amplification of 4 is proposed for low/medium rise buildings and 3 for flexible high-rise buildings (T &gt; 1.7 s). In the second stage, a simplified method for the prediction of seismic shear forces and overturning moments at the base of self-supporting steel lattice telecommunication towers mounted on building rooftops is presented. The proposed method involves the estimation of four parameters: the rooftop seismic acceleration, the mass distribution profile of the tower along its height, the maximum acceleration amplification at the tower top, and the fundamental sway mode shape of the tower on a rigid base. The method was validated by means of numerical results of nine generated building-tower combinations composed of three towers assumed to be mounted on three of the building models studied in the first stage of the research. The building-tower combinations were subjected to the same sets of earthquake records used for the prediction of accelerations. It was found the proposed method yields conservative results in all the cases analyzed. In addition, the empirical component force amplification factor for telecommunication towers as proposed in the NBCC 2005 was compared to the factors evaluated for the towers of the 16 building-tower combinations. Improved component force amplification factors based on rational analysis are proposed.</description><creator>Assi, Rola.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Engineering, Civil.</subject><title>Seismic analysis of telecommunication towers mounted on building rooftops</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Rola Assi, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rb68xh28m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3j333661d</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1z40kz135</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Self-heating of sulphide minerals has a potential for serious impact on environment and safety in mining of ores, and storage and transport of concentrates. A research program, focused on the investigation of the conditions under which the H2S is produced from pyrrhotite-rich materials, has been initiated using the self-heating facility and technology developed at the Noranda Technology Centre. It is hypothesized that H 2S production could be important in self-heating as the exothermic heat of oxidation of H2S to SO2 is greater than that for oxidation of S to SO2. The hypothesis of liberation of H2S was tested using copper (as metal pieces and sulphate solution) as a detector, both in the self-heating apparatus and in a "weathering" apparatus at 40°C. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy analysis of coatings and precipitates confirmed the formation of copper sulphide and therefore indicated the release of H 2S. Release of H2S involves acid conditions and the possible origin of the acidity was discussed. Prior work had suggested that the level of exposure to oxygen was a factor in self-heating. Tests were conducted to explore the role of oxygen level. Three tests were conducted in the weathering apparatus at 40°C with covers of no hole, 3 holes and 128 holes to control access the air. Weight gain was recorded every two days and stage B self-heating tests were conducted on the samples after a month of weathering. Under limited air access (no hole and 3 hole covers), the samples showed higher weight gain, higher degree of oxidation (by colour change) and higher self-heating rates compared with the sample with more exposure to air (128 hole cover). X-ray diffraction analysis identified the oxidation products elemental sulphur, maghemite and goethite in the samples under the limited air conditions. A series of non-standard self-heating tests were conducted in the self-heating apparatus under different air flow rates of Stage A. These showed that the samples weathered under low air flow rates yielded significantly higher self-heating rates in both stage A and B. All the experiments indicate that a high level of exposure to air dose not promote self-heating but rather suppress it. Less oxidative conditions play a critical role in the self-heating of pyrrhotite-rich materials.</description><creator>Wang, Xinran, 1973-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Pyrrhotite -- Heating.</subject><title>Exploring conditions leading to self-heating of pyrrhotite-rich materials</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Xinran Wang, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cr56n544m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1z40kz135</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n009w653n</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Nanopowders and bulk nanostructred materials have gained large interest in recent years. Bulk nanostructured materials exhibit properties that are far superior in comparison to conventional micron grained alloys. The fabrication of large scale nano-grained materials has been achieved in a two step process: (1) the production of nanostructured aluminium alloy powders and (2) the consolidation of the powder using a electromagnetic shockwave process. The first part consists of cryo-milling; the milling of powder in an attritor filled with liquid nitrogen. This causes successive welding and fracturing events as the powder is milled, thereby creating the nano-structure. The low temperature prevents the possibility of recrystallization and grain growth. The alloy used for this work was Al 5356 (Al-5%Mg). Two different types of raw source materials were investigated: pre-alloyed powders and a mixture of aluminum with pure magnesium or an Al12Mg17 intermetallic. Experiments have been conducted in order to determine the optimum milling parameters that will simultaneously give a grain size smaller than 100 nm; equiaxed milled particles and mechanically alloyed powder (in the case of the mixture). The optimum milling parameters were established at 15 hours of milling time with a rotational speed of 300 RPM and ball to powder weight ratio of 24:1 in the case of the pre-alloyed powders. For the mixture of pure aluminum with pure magnesium the parameters were 15 hours, 300RPM and 32:1. The parameters for the mixture with the intermetallic were 18 hours, 300RPM and 32:1. The dynamic magnetic compaction technique was done with a peak pressure of 1.1 GPa. This ultra-high strain rate process minimizes the exposure of the powders to high temperature and therefore reduces the possibility of recrystallization and grain growth. Relative densities of compacted pieces obtained ranged from 86.39% to 97.97%. However consolidation characterized by particle to particle bonding with a melted layer was not accomplished.</description><creator>Seminari, Umugaba.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Aluminum-magnesium alloys.</subject><subject>Nanocrystals.</subject><subject>Aluminum powder.</subject><title>Production of nanocrystalline aluminium alloy powders through cryogenic milling and consolidation by dynamic magnetic compaction</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Umugaba Seminari, 2007</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/47429f72s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n009w653n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n870zv750</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Magnesium sheet for automotive applications is very attractive due to its light weight. The poor formability of magnesium and its alloys at room temperature, however, has limited the applications of these alloys. For this reason, at present, magnesium must be formed at elevated temperatures. This study investigates the hot deformation and fracture characteristics of Mg-1wt% Zn alloys containing a range of Al and Mn levels. Hot-rolled specimens were tensile tested over a range of strain rates and temperatures. Strain rate versus flow stress diagrams plotted on log-log scales revealed a transition in deformation mechanisms as a change in slope (the 'stress exponent'). Specifically, non-uniform deformation (i.e. necking) is observed at high strain rates, while uniform deformation is observed at low rates. This transition is accompanied by a change in fracture mechanism from dimpled rupture at high strain rates to cavitation and cavity interlinkage at low strain rates. Specimens which had a stress exponent of ~2 and which failed through uniform deformation showing interlinked cavities have been associated with the grain boundary sliding (GBS) deformation mechanism. Specimens which had a stress exponent of ~5 and which failed through necking showing a dimpled fracture surface have been associated with the dislocation creep deformation mechanism. Increasing aluminum appears to somewhat favour the GBS regime as indicated by a slightly decreasing stress exponent. Manganese also appears to favor the GBS regime, since the onset of cavitation appears at higher strain rates compared to alloys without Mn.</description><creator>Seale, Geoff, 1978-</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Zinc alloys.</subject><subject>Magnesium alloys -- Founding.</subject><subject>Aluminum alloys.</subject><subject>Manganese alloys.</subject><title>Hot deformation mechanisms in Mg-x%Al-1%Zn-y%Mn alloys</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Geoff Seale, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rr172241b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n870zv750</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3r075040d</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Platelets have been shown to be a main contributor to thrombus formation in stenotic arteries leading to acute coronary syndromes. It is thought that increased activation and adhesion of platelets under variable shear and complex flow conditions contribute to thrombosis. The objective of this work was to evaluate the relationship between asymmetric stenosis hemodynamics and platelet adhesion using in-vitro models developed to properly simulate physiological conditions. In this study, platelet rich plasma was circulated through stenotic and straight coronary artery models. Adhesion results were obtained by post-perfusion fluorescent labelling and imaging of adhered platelets. Analysis of platelet area coverage has shown maximum adhesion occurs in the distal region of the stenosis. Most likely this is due to increased exposure time of platelets to the wall of the recirculation zone following the stenosis and that exposure being directly after a period of high shear stress. This result gives us a better understanding of the importance of both shear and flow conditions in coronary artery thrombosis.</description><creator>Shrum, Jeff.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Coronary circulation.</subject><subject>Blood platelets -- Aggregation.</subject><subject>Coronary arteries -- Stenosis.</subject><title>Platelet adhesion in an asymmetric stenosis flow model</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Jeff Shrum, 2007</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k930c2519.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3r075040d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xp68km40n</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The development of numerical skills in children with Down syndrome is an area of research that has been neglected in the literature despite overwhelming evidence of its importance, both pedagogically, and for everyday functioning. The present study examines two important sub-skills of numeracy. Twelve boys with Down syndrome were compared to 24 typically developing boys (matched on verbal mental age and on chronological age) on two novel, computerized tasks designed to measure sequential processing and counting. Boys with Down syndrome performed comparably to both groups of typically matched controls on the sequential task. However, differences emerged when boys with Down syndrome were required to point and attribute meaning to each step on the counting task. These findings offer novel insights into the development of number skills and provide important data that can aid in the creation of syndrome-specific education strategies to maximize the potential of children with Down syndrome.</description><creator>Waxman, Natalie.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Cognition.</subject><subject>Down syndrome.</subject><subject>Number concept.</subject><title>Counting and sequential processing in children with Down Syndrome and typically developing children</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Natalie Waxman, 2007</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h702qb65s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xp68km40n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:b5644w93x</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this paper, the evocative nature of patina on stringed instruments is linked to the four agents of transformation that create it. These correspond to four nostalgic values: nostalgic reflection on the passage of time; nostalgia inspired by use; nostalgia for craftsmanship and pastoral nostalgia. Actors in the subfield of restricted cultural production of stringed instruments invoke one or more of these nostalgic values explicitly as a means to rationalize their actions to competing actors and to the broader public in their battle for status. Patina offers visible proof of their claims. Actors in the subfield of large-scale cultural production do not appeal to specific nostalgic values. Rather, they partake of the nostalgic aura surrounding antique instruments by "pasting" artificial patina onto their instruments. This serves to validate the idea of nostalgia. It also lays bare tensions existing in the broader field of cultural production over questions concerning the past and present.</description><creator>Wilder, Thomas.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Stringed instrument makers.</subject><subject>Stringed instruments -- Construction.</subject><subject>Antiques.</subject><subject>Nostalgia.</subject><title>Patina and the role of nostalgia in the field of stringed instrument cultural production</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Thomas Wilder, 2007</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6t053m607.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b5644w93x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:f4752n01p</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Since the "reform and opening-up" policy, Chinese society has been greatly affected by rapid industrialization, the installation of a market economy, and exposure to Western ideas and practices. These changes are having an impact on the current moral education program in varying degrees of intensity. The purpose of this thesis is to develop a framework for moral education in a meaningful and practical manner, and to provide an antidote to the current confusion regarding values in China. This thesis examines moral theories from both Eastern and Western perspectives. It focuses on Confucianism and Storytelling primarily. Confucianism, specially the Five Constant Virtues, still has practical value for a modern Chinese society. The storytelling approach, it is argued, creates the opportunity for critical thinking and self-reflection, and embraces both traditional and modern concerns. I conclude that a new moral education curriculum integrating Confucianism and storytelling is particularly promising in this regard.</description><creator>Yang, Jie, 1983-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Moral education -- China.</subject><title>Moral education in the emerging Chinese society</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Jie Yang, 2007</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0k225g35h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f4752n01p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Culture and Values in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):41850</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
