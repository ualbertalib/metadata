solvent, in an argon transferred-arc plasma with a single stationary pellet reactor system. A conversion-time model, based on experimental and theoretical studies, was proposed to describe the carbothermic reduction reaction systems. The experimental results confirmed the applicability of the model. The carbothermic reduction of pyrochlore and niobium pentoxide were studied in the temperature range 1530-2440 and 1625-2855 K, respectively. The rate was independent of particle size but was influenced by the separation between the oxide and carbon particles. The rate was lower than the model predictions above a certain conversion, the level of which increased with temperature and carbon concentration. The carbothermic reduction of pyrochlore and niobium pentoxide with iron addition were studied in the temperature range 1430-2125 and 1575-2440 K, respectively. The rates were independent of particle size but was enhanced by the presence of iron. Deviation from the model was observed to be less at high conversion levels. Preliminary investigation of the conversion rate for the carbothermic reduction of a pyrochlore and ferric oxide mixture was done to simulate the type of reactants that would be used in a commercial process. The rate was improved by the addition of iron oxide.</description><creator>Chin, Earle J.</creator><contributor>Munz, R. J.

The Demazure-Gaskell character formula for calculating a generating function is discussed in detail. Using the concept of the depth of a weight i.e. the number of simple roots that are subtracted from the highest weight of a representation in order to arrive at a particular weight in that representation, the representations of affine Kac-Moody algebras are studied. The Demazure-Gaskell method is then applied to these representations, and the generating functions for the representations to finite depth are calculated. Both complete representations and fully degenerate representations i.e. those whose highest weights contains only one non-zero weight component, are considered. Generating functions for complete and fully degenerate representations of affine Kac-Moody algebras are given.</description><creator>Day, Lawrence Harvey</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Physics, Elementary Particles and High Energy.</subject><title>Generating functions and the representations of affine Kac-Moody algebras</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pk02cb52v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qz20st276</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ww72bc22q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis analyses transformations in pediatrics during its history as an organized medical specialty. Pediatricians emerged in a period of high infant and child mortality and poor public health to fight disease and treat difficult feeding problems. After mortality rates began to decline they turned to prevention, supervising the normal growth and development of healthy children. However, as prevention absorbed an ever larger proportion of their time, they became bored and dissatisfied. During the 1970s, competing groups of child health care providers such as pediatric nurse practitioners and family practitioners exacerbated pediatricians' difficulties. Worried about their possible disappearance as primary care specialists, pediatricians sought a new mission in ministering to children's non-physical problems. The "new pediatrics" focuses on the behavioral and psychosocial problems of children and adolescents. This study contributes to understanding how professions respond to changes and threats in their environment.</description><creator>Pawluch, Dorothy, 1953-</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Pediatrics -- Practice</subject><subject>Pediatricians -- Supply and demand</subject><title>Whither pediatrics : a study in professional transformations</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9w0323730.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bc22q</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Sociology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jw827c43q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Gas-solids separation was studied in a 102 mm diameter conventional cyclone operated with air heated to temperatures between 300 K and 2 000 K. Cyclone pressure drops, fractional and overall collection efficiencies were measured as functions of temperature, gas throughput, dust loading and cyclone geometry. Alumina and silica of 100% less than 44 $ mu$m mass median diameter were used as test dusts. Inlet velocities ranged from 3 to 42 m/s and inlet dust loadings were between 0.3 and 235 g/m$ sp3$. Empirical models were derived to correlate the experimental results for the cyclone collection efficiency, pressure drop, tangential velocity and 50% cut size. The performance of the cyclones at very high temperatures was not significantly different from the room temperature behavior, provided that the effect of temperature on particle, gas and flow properties was adequately treated.</description><creator>Patterson, Peter A.</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>High temperature cyclones</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hd76s087q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jw827c43q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bk128b58r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Solid residues are generated at various stages of metal production. Some of these residues still contain significant quantities of metals. In determining possible process routes for residues a detailed knowledge of the mineralogy (i.e. the minerals or phases present) is required. This thesis examines the mineralogical characteristics of four residues: copper smelter dust, jarosite residue and hot-acid-leach residue all from the metallurgical plant of Kidd Creek Mines Ltd., and low-acid-leach residue from the Canadian Electrolytic Zinc plant. The methodology of characterization included the fractionation of the residues based on particle size, magnetic susceptibility and leachability in sulphuric acid. The fractions were analyzed by X-ray diffractometry and electron beam techniques. A major phase in all the residues was zinc ferrite. The characterization of this phase showed that it does not have the stoichiometric composition of ZnFe$ sb2$O$ sb4$ but exhibits a variable composition of the type Zn$ sb{x}$Fe$ sb{3-x}$O$ sb4$. This variable composition corresponds to a measured variation in magnitude susceptibility of the ferrites. Some treatment routes for these residues are examined; special emphasis was placed on the potential application of magnetic separation. The hot-acid-leach residue appeared the most amenable to magnetic separation.</description><creator>Lastra Quintero, Rolando</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</subject><title>Investigation of the mineralogical characteristics of fine particle residues</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g732d967v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bk128b58r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ws859g38c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis examines the use of conjunctions in texts, and in particular their function as a marker of text type. Children's acquisition of this aspect of conjunction usage is the main focus. An examination of the characteristics of various text types and the nature of coordinate and subordinate conjunctions in English serves as a framework within which the experimental evidence from adults and children (aged three to five) is considered. Three types of texts--conversation, narratives, and game explanations--were collected. It was found that both the types of conjunctions used and the frequency of conjunctions as a class vary according to text type; conjunctions are much more frequent in narratives and explanations than in conversation. It is shown here that pragmatic or cognitive factors cannot account for these findings; they can only be explained as a function of text type. The data from the children provide evidence that their conjunction usage is also constrained by text type, although their patterns of use are not exactly the same as the adults'. The results indicate that by age five children have a definite conception of text as a linguistic entity.</description><creator>Laubitz, Zofia</creator><date>1988</date><subject>English language -- Acquisition -- Research</subject><subject>English language -- Conjunctions</subject><subject>Language acquisition -- Research</subject><title>Coordinate and subordinate conjunctions in children's texts</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9306sz887.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ws859g38c</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Linguistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z603qz138</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Research on electrochemical detection methods for electroactive species in flowing streams is focussing on improving selectivity without compromising sensitivity or detection limits. With this in mind an effective electrode would be one that can examine electroactivity at many potentials in the shortest possible time frame. This work has investigated this possibility by using a single low temperature isotropic carbon working electrode with a choice of three scanning techniques. The most familiar one is cyclic voltammetry which is known to generate a wealth of qualitative information. The other modes are pulse and square-wave cyclic voltammetry. These modified versions of cyclic voltammetry offer advantages in two additional domains. Electroactivity may be studied in two time frames, increasing the diagnostic power, and quantitative determinations are possible. The enhancements and limitations of these scanning methods were investigated based on data obtained from a variety of electroactive model compounds. The survey was performed in quiet and flowing solutions using flow injection analysis for the latter.</description><creator>Eccles, Gordon N.</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Chemistry, Analytical.</subject><title>A rapid scan electrochemical detector based on pulse methods /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9z903065h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z603qz138</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8049g5770</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Space WARC resulted in significant changes to the regulatory regime of satellite telecommunications. This dissertation examines the Space WARC and its effects. The basis for an understanding of the relevant issues is established by an overview of the resources and technology involved in satellite telecommunications, a summary of the institutional framework, and a review of the events leading to the Conference. The legal and regulatory regime applicable to satellite telecommunications before the Space WARC is examined, including aspects of international space law and international telecommunications law, and the goal of the Conference--equitable access--is analyzed. Both sessions of the Space WARC and its important intersessional period are reviewed, and its results are detailed. The compliance of the new regimes of satellite telecommunication with international space law and the issues of space law raised at the Conference are also examined. An analysis and conclusions complete this study.</description><creator>Smith, Milton L.</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Law.</subject><title>International regulation of satellite telecommunications after the space WARC</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rr171x844.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8049g5770</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Civil Law</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z316q2179</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Crop-available zinc is affected by P-Zn interactions in soils. Orthophosphate (OP) additions may decrease or have no effect, while pyrophosphate (PP) may increase or have no effect on Zn solubility. Mechanisms involved in the interactions are not well understood and need to be quantified on agricultural soils subjected to P fertilization. Top and sub-samples from three Quebec agricultural soils were equilibrated with OP or PP solutions, then with Zn solutions, and finally with solutions containing neither P nor Zn. The first equilibration evaluated P sorption effects on soil cation exchange capacity (CEC), the second equilibration evaluated Zn sorption (Zn$ sb{ rm s}$) after P sorption, and the third Zn desorption (Zn$ sb{ rm D}$) as related to added P. Subsequently, Zn fractions were extracted sequentially with KNO$ sb3$ (Zn$ sb{ rm KNO3}$), NaOH (Zn$ sb{ rm NaOH}$) solutions and concentrated HNO$ sb3$ + H$ sb2$O$ sb2$ (Zn$ sb{ rm HNO3}$). Autoclaved soils were used for OP and PP comparisons, and non-autoclaved soils were used for OP determinations. Autoclaving reduced dithionite-citrate extractable Fe and Al materials. In both autoclaved and non-autoclaved soils, one mmole sorbed P as PP or OP resulted in increases in CEC from 0.52-1.24 mmole (+). Comparison between OP and PP in the autoclaved soils indicated that the increased CEC per mmole sorbed was greater with sorbed OP than with PP, while at the same rate of P addition, the absolute increased CEC was more with sorbed PP than with OP due to greater P sorption as PP compared to OP. Both sorbed OP or PP in autoclaved soils and sorbed OP in non-autoclaved soils increased specific Zn sorption in association with oxide materials. The effect was more significant with PP than with OP, as indicated by the observations: (1) P sorption increased Zn sorption but reduced Zn desorption, (2) P sorption reduced KNO$ sb3$- but increased NaOH- and HNO$ sb3$-extractable Zn, and (3) P sorption increased the difference between Zn sorbed and Zn extracted with KNO$ sb3$. These effects were more significant in coarser than finer textured soils. Results suggested that Zn fertilizers should be separated from P fertilizers to avoid enhanced Zn sorption and reduced Zn desorption.</description><creator>Xie, Rongjing</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Soil absorption and adsorption -- Effect of zinc on -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Phosphatic fertilizers.</subject><title>Ortho- and pyrophosphate sorption effects on zinc transformations in three Quebec soils</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Rongjing Xie, 1988</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xw42n8701.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z316q2179</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Renewable Resources</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:s1784m41b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:57:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The immunological responses in hosts infected with Trypanosoma lewisi were examined during the course of infection and after recovery. Peak antibody levels coincided with the time of parasite elimination, but remained significantly elevated for over one year after the end of the infection The antigen repertoire recognized by antibodies demonstrated that some were revealed only by sera taken during the infection, and other antigens were revealed for the first time only by post-recovery sera. Immunomodulatory protective and suppressive factors were demonstrated in the plasma of irradiated, infected rats. These factors were identified as parasite-derived exoantigens which are shed in vivo and in vitro; exoantigens are complexes of proteins, lipids and polysaccharides and are membrane-surface coat associated, as shown by phase-partitioning and surface-labeling studies. The suppressive activity of the exoantigens was dose-dependent, probably mediated by a suppressor substance(s) produced by macrophages that subsequently inhibits production of interleukin 2 by T helper cells.</description><creator>Ndarathi, Charles W.
