To meet this situation, the British took steps to strengthen their naval position and to cultivate the friendship of other European Powers. In April, 1904, Britain signed an agreement with France, clearing up many problems that had stood in the way of better relations between the two countries, and she hoped to conclude a similar agreement with Russia.</description><creator>Rubin, Gerald.

Diapedesis of red cells, edema and nerve cell damage in acute stages, and perivascular hematogenous pigment, nerve cell deficit and gliosis around the blood vessels in chronic conditions are examples of such changes. More direct evidence was obtained in experiments in which trypan blue was used to test the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in various pathological conditions - among others, in the electrically-induced epileptic seizures.</description><creator>Rozdilsky, Bohdan.</creator><contributor>Olszewski, J.

The experimental results were considered mainly in relation to several types of analogous structures, common in the analysis of lumped circuits, but one attempt was made to relate them to electromagnetic field theory. Preliminary experiments were made on rectangular waveguides but most of the experiments were on a cylindrical guide obstructed by plane irises. The stop bands and pass bands of the structure were located by measurement of the natural resonances of a short section of the guide closed by metal end plates. These same experiments gave information on the various velocities of propagation within the structures.</description><creator>Roumbanis, Theodore.</creator><contributor>Woonton, G.

He indicates that while adolescence has come to mean irresponsibility and a stage of uncertainty in modern Western society, this phenomenon does not necessarily appear in other times and cultures. He says: “We have suggested that the problem which appears as irresponsibility to the grown-up world, the adolescent feels as uncertainty concerning himself.

But quantitative studies of films of oil on water were not really made until the middle of the 19th century when it was found (Quincke, 1869) (1), (Plateau, 1873) (2) that measurements of the surface tension of water were poorly reproducible. In 1890, Agnes Pockels (3) made an important contribution to the study of surface oil films. [...] </description><creator>Rabinovitch, William.</creator><contributor>Mason, S.G.

Previous work on entrance region heat transfer by J. T. Rogers showed that for a given Reynolds number, higher heat transfer coefficients are obtained with increasing bulk temperatures. Present work confirma Rogers' findings and shows that a temperature correction factor is necessary to account for this increase in the value of heat transfer coefficients with increasing temperatures.
