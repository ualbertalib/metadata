Molecular biological studies have shown that several components of the signal transduction pathways are affected in bipolar illness. However, the precise systems and components involved in the disorder still remain unknown. Our goal was to identify some of the differences in signal transduction pathways of B-lymphocytes. Using cultured lymphocytes obtained from bipolar patients, we found that there exist no difference in the levels of protein kinase C, Galphas and Galphai proteins, and tubulin between control and bipolar cell lines following stimulation of the PI pathway with the 5-HT 2 receptor agonist, alpha-methyl serotonin. These data are not consistent with previous findings. The lack of a significant difference between control and bipolar with respect to PKC might be due to the fact that we studied a different cell type or to poor stimulation conditions, and/or possibly to a high PKC content in the membrane of these cells, thereby masking the effect of stimulation. The results obtained for the G proteins can be attributed to a lack of effect of the agonist on these proteins which are associated with the adenylate cyclase pathway.</description><creator>Constant, Peggy.</creator><contributor>Palmour, Roberta (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Cellular signal transduction.</subject><subject>B cells.</subject><subject>Manic-depressive illness -- Molecular aspects.</subject><title>Alterations of signal transduction in lymphocytes cultured from patients with bipolar disorder</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/79407z98n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5712m844v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:s1784n49r</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:54:35Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Glucocorticoid (GC) stimulation of both branching morphogenesis and cytodifferentiation in the developing lung is mediated by the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR). Seventy-five percent of mice homozygous for a targeted disruption of the GR gene (GR hypo) die shortly after birth due to respiratory failure. Surviving GRhypo mice are normal and fertile. We used Differential Display Reverse Transcription PCR (DD-PCR) and then cDNA microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes in GR hypo compared to wildtype mice. The retinoic acid responsive gene, midkine (MK) was up-regulated in GRhypo mice at fetal day 18 and at neonatal day 1 (in both survivors and non-survivors). At fetal day 16.5, MK was down-regulated in GRhypo mice compared to wildtype. GC treatment up-regulated MK expression in fetal day 20 rat lung Epi cells in primary culture. These results indicate that in the absence of GR, MK is disregulated in the lung: in the pseudoglandular and canalicular stage, MK is down-regulated, but by the saccular stage, and then shortly after birth, the absence of GR results in up-regulation of MK expression. Our findings suggest that down-regulation of the growth factor MK in late gestation is essential to normal terminal differentiation of the fetal lung.</description><creator>Comber, Julie.</creator><contributor>Kaplan, Feige (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Biology, Genetics.</subject><title>Altered gene expression in glucocorticoid receptor knockout mice : characterization of midkine expression</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/44558f982.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s1784n49r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Human Genetics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g158bj95r</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:54:36Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The work of contemporary Atlantic Canadian filmmaker William O. MacGillivray is a set of confrontations. His five fiction feature films investigate, perhaps even recalibrate, conventionally understood ideas of centre and margin, time and space, and most pointedly, traditional and modern. What MacGillivray presents in his work is not, in the manner of George Grant, a lament for a traditional or old and noble world locked inexorably in the processes of technological erasure. Instead, echoing the actively ambivalent response to technology-induced change advanced by Harold Innis and others, what the films reveal is a range of possible alternative critical positions within the experience of modern lite in contemporary Atlantic Canada. As Carlos Fuentes reminds us, this does not necessarily entail 'sacrificing the past in favour of the new,' as much of the rhetoric surrounding notions of the modern insists, but rather the 'maintaining, comparing, and remembering values we have created, making them modern so as not lose the value of the modern.' ln a sense, this process is about remembering time. Fundamentally, in creating rich, complex narratives about a part of Canada facing considerable and rapid change, MacGillivray is making his own cinematic 'plea for time' in his confrontations with notions of what constitutes a modern existence. It is also a plea for space, to remember that as there are 'different modern times' there are also 'different modern spaces.'</description><creator>McSorley, Tom.</creator><contributor>Straw, William (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>MacGillivray, William D -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><subject>Time in motion pictures.</subject><title>Modern times : time and the modern in the fiction films of William D.

Here, we have investigated the effect of different types of stress on classical nuclear protein import as well as nuclear import of Ssa4p family of heat shock proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Under normal conditions, Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP), carrying a classical nuclear localization sequence (cNLS-GFP) is nuclear. However, cNLS-GFP equilibrates throughout the cell upon exposure to heat, ethanol, H2O2 or starvation. Redistribution of the small GTPase Gsp1p, a soluble nuclear transport factor, correlates with cNLS-GFP equilibration. This suggests that a collapse of the Gsp1p gradient underlies the inhibition of classical nuclear protein import. In contrast to cNLS-GFP, the cytoplasmic heat shock protein Ssa4p accumulates in nuclei when classical nuclear import is inhibited. The N-terminal 236 amino acid residues of Ssa4p are sufficient for nuclear localization of Ssa4p-GFP upon heat and ethanol stress. The nuclear localization of Ssa4p(1--236)-GFP requires components of Gsp1-GTPase system, but is independent of Srp1p, the cNLS receptor. Ssa4p(16--642)-GFP accumulates in nuclei of starving cells, mediated by a hydrophobic stretch of amino acid residues in its N-terminal domain. This nuclear localization is reversible upon addition of fresh medium and its export is sensitive to oxidants and temperature-dependent.</description><creator>Rassadi, Roozbeh.</creator><contributor>Stochaj, Ursula (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>The effect of stress on nuclear protein transport : classical nuclear protein transport versus the nuclear transport of heat shock proteins</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rb68xd45n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1c18dh58k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physiology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q524jq53z</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:54:36Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Parent and teacher ratings of hyperactivity are compared with an objective measure of activity level (actigraphy) for 19 ADHD children and 18 control subjects. All subjects wore the actigraph during a full day diagnostic assessment. Mean actigraph scores were calculated for the structured (including time during the Continuous Performance Test (CPT)) and unstructured element of the assessment. The structured, unstructured and CPT settings were significantly differentiated for the sample as whole by actigraphic measures. However no significant difference in activity level was found when we compared the subgroups (Controls, medicated ADHD, non-medicated ADHD). Parent ratings were not correlated with actigraphic measures in any setting. Teacher ratings on the Hyperactivity Index were significantly correlated with activity during the structured and unstructured setting for the whole sample and the ADHD subjects. These data indicate that teacher ratings of hyperactivity are more reliable than parent ratings on identical items when one is interested in gross motor activity.

The approach is based on using an attention mechanism to obtain visual features that are generic, robust and informative. The features themselves are recognized using principal components in the frequency domain. We show that we can perform robust appearance based object recognition by using the visual characteristics of only a small number of such features. The technique is robust to planar translations and rotations of the object being recognized due to our polar sampling in the frequency domain. We are able to recognize objects on different types of background clutter due to a masking technique we've developed. We are also able to handle a degree of occlusion as we make use of multiple features for the purposes of recognition. The same approach is further applied in the field of robotics to provide a means for the automatic recognition of locations or landmarks in scenes typically encountered by mobile robots. Hence instead of only recognizing objects, we also present a means of using the same computational model to recognize locations, thus performing coarse localization.</description><creator>Jugessur, Deeptiman.</creator><contributor>Dudek, G.

Molecular analysis of prostate cancer will eventually lead to the discovery of key genes involved in its onset and progression. The present project was to compare gene expression profiles in human non-tumorigenic versus tumorigenic prostate cell lines generated in our laboratory. A putative tumor suppressor gene present on 12q13 would be responsible for the non-tumorigenic phenotype of one cell line as discovered earlier by our team. In order to compare gene expression patterns, expression arrays from Clontech, bearing 588 genes known to be involved in human cancers, were hybridized with cDNA derived from two related cell lines available in our laboratory. This one experiment provided interesting hints on differentially expressed genes that could be involved in human prostate cancer. Interesting clones were confirmed by Northern blots. When commercial antibody was available, analysis was extended at the protein level. A combination of these analyses revealed no striking difference in the level of expression for the genes previously identified by the arrays hybridization. Simultaneously, differential display PCR techniques, allowing the discovery of unknown differentially expressed molecules and thus complementing the previous approach, were applied to compare related cell lines and unique hybrids. Cloning and sequencing of differential fragments brought us to what could be a new cDNA expressed in many human cell lines. Prostate cancer is not well characterized enough to allow accurate diagnosis or appropriate therapy strategies. Differentially expressed molecules analyzed in this project as well as the putative new cDNA might fulfil part of this lack in the understanding of this disease.</description><creator>Trudel, Nathalie.</creator><contributor>Chevrette, Mario (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</subject><title>Gene expression profile in human prostate cancer cell lines</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2b88qd87n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pv63g198f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Surgical Research</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:f7623f37p</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:54:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>With the rapid aging of the population, the presence of seniors in the emergency department (ED) is increasing. While the functional outcomes of seniors following an ED visit has been described, their predictors have not been examined by gender and age. This prospective multi-centre study of a cohort of 1659 seniors living in the community described the characteristics of men and women, age 65 to 79 and age 80 and over, presenting to the ED, and defined predictors of adverse functional outcome (functional decline, institutionalisation or death) 6 months after their visit. There were more gender differences in the presenting characteristics and predictors in seniors age 65 to 79, than in those aged 80 and over. Two factors predicted adverse functional outcome in all seniors: admission to hospital at the ED visit and baseline level of disability. For seniors age 80 and over, these were the main predictors. For seniors age 65 to 79, predictors differed by gender. Among men, death was more frequent and predictors included measures of comorbidity. Among women, functional decline was more frequent and predictors included living alone, visual and cognitive impairment. These results underline the importance of age and gender when describing functional outcomes of seniors. Knowledge of these predictors should allow emergency department staff to identify seniors at risk and develop appropriate interventions that may help prevent such poor outcome.</description><creator>Verdon, Josée.</creator><contributor>McCusker, Jane (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Bellavance, Francois (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><subject>Gerontology.</subject><title>Seniors in the emergency department : age and gender differences in presenting characteristics and predictors of adverse functional outcome at six months</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2r36v034v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f7623f37p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zk51vj53f</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:54:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis documents the design and implementation of Updates and Event Handlers in a relational database programming language. Update operations are implemented in the nested relational model and Event Handlers transform the database system from passive to active. The update operation allows the user to change values of specified attributes in certain tuples. These attributes can be selected by a "using" clause which uses a relational algebra operation to select tuples from the relation we want to update. We can also use updates to add or delete some tuples to or from the relation. The nested update in nested relations will also be presented. Event handlers are introduced as procedures, invoked by events which are system generated procedure calls. We implement the event handler based on computation---the procedural abstraction facility of the database programming language. An update statement can invoke multiple event handlers. Event handlers may contain update statements which in turn invoke other event handlers. This introduces cascading event handlers. We will present the combination of update and event handler algorithm by which the update; operation is coupled with event handler closely and neatly, and the cascading event handler is handled by the system's recursive execution. In this thesis, we provide the user a uniform syntax to update both flat relations and nested relations. The unification of computation and procedure leads to a simpler language. More over, the explicitness and intuitiveness of the definition and implementation of both event and event handler are under substantial considerations.</description><creator>Sun, Weizhong, 1975-</creator><contributor>Merrett, Tim (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Updates and events in a nested relational programming language</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9s161808v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zk51vj53f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4x51hk96k</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:54:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>STACEE (Solar Tower Atmospheric Cerenkov Effect Experiment) is a ground-based gamma-ray telescope. Using a large array of mirrors from a solar heliostat facility to capture Cerenkov light from gamma-ray showers in the atmosphere, STACEE plans to lower the threshold available to ground-based gamma-ray telescopes. Determining the threshold of STACEE is reliant upon understanding the components of the telescope. The photomultiplier tubes used to convert the Cerenkov light to electronic signals need to be carefully characterized as a part of this process. We describe a method to determine the gain of the photomultiplier tubes using an uncalibrated light source.

In the present study we investigated the behavioural response to severe pain in the developing nervous system as well as the degree to which morphine can produce adequate analgesia. We describe the behavioural response in 3 and 15 day old rat pups to intraplantar injection of formalin at concentrations capable of inducing c-Fos. These concentrations are 10-fold higher than that necessary to evoke continuous pain behaviour over a period 40--60 minutes. Dose-effect relations for morphine were examined to determine if pain continued to increase with formalin concentration, in the presence of maximal levels of pain behaviour. Pain behaviour increased in intensity and duration with formalin concentration in infant rats, despite the presence of a behavioural ceiling, as illustrated by the increased morphine requirement for analgesia. Non-specific pain behaviour and sleep/wake states were altered by severe pain. The analgesic effects of morphine were found to be independent of its sedative effects in both age groups. Moreover, in rat pups, full analgesia cannot be obtained by subtoxic doses of morphine when high formalin concentrations are used. These data suggest that severe pain is not fully controllable in the infant due to immaturity of the substrates of opioid analgesia, and raise ethical questions about the use of high formalin concentrations in immature animals. The data also underline the need for adequate pain measures in human infants that can distinguish between pain relief, sedation and coping behaviour.</description><creator>Najafee, Robert H.</creator><contributor>Abbott, Frances V.

DNA probes that hybridize to genes coding for key enzymes that catalyze microbial processes have been widely used. Can such probes be used to quantify target genes and thus quantify the potential of a microbial community to carry out a reaction of interest? Optimal conditions for DNA extraction, probe validation, hybridization, and activity measurements were determined for the pulp and paper treatment system environment under study. Using gene probes for key denitrification genes (nirS, nirK), the correlation between denitrifiers and denitrification activity in an enrichment culture and activated sludge samples was tested. The same correlation between nitrogen fixation and nitrogen-fixing bacteria in primary clarifiers was assessed using a probe for the gene encoding a component of the nitrogenase enzyme (nifH).

Sherdil pioneered the progress functions study in the field of software development, which, if effectively used, can significantly help reduce the software cost and time and improve product quality. In his research, he found that an average of 22% autonomous (first-order) learning takes place in all the three fields, productivity, product quality and personal skills. Whereas second-order training and technology seems to have helped software engineers by up to 13% more in progress, as compared to first-order learning. This thesis presents an external replication of Sherdil's experiment, so as to assess whether his results can be generalizable. Our replication can be categorized as fairly precise where all the procedural variables were duplicated as closely as possible.

While protein kinase A (PKA) is the main activator of CFTR, patch clamp data have suggested a permissive role for PKC in modulating PKA responses. To clarify the role of PKC in CFTR regulation we used PCR mutagenesis to construct a CFTR mutant (9CA) in which the serines or threonines in nine consensus sequences for PKC phosphorylation were replaced by alanines. Its expression in stably transfected baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells was consistently lower than that of wild-type (WT) CFTR. Nevertheless, 9CA cells displayed a robust cAMP-stimulated iodide efflux which was comparable in magnitude to that of WT CFTR cells when normalised for protein expression level. The cpt-cAMP concentration-response relationship in intact cells was similar for WT and 9CA CFTR (EC50 ≈ 100muM), however the onset of iodide efflux from cells expressing the mutant was markedly delayed at all cpt-cAMP concentrations tested. This delay was mimicked by pre-treating WT cells with the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine (10muM), and chelerythrine did not cause further slowing of iodide efflux from 9CA cells. In vitro phosphorylation by PKA and PKC was similar for WT and 9CA CFTR and phosphorylation in the presence of both kinases was additive. A major impediment to understanding CFTR structure/function has been the difficulty of obtaining sufficient purified CFTR protein for biochemical studies. In an attempt to overcome this problem we expressed a His-tagged CFTR construct in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. The final yield of CFTRHis10 following solubilization of Pichia membranes in 0.5% lysophosphatidylglycerol (LPG) and nickel chelate chromatography was ~20mug/litre. CFTRHis10 was not glycosylated in this yeast system. Both PKA and PKC phosphorylated semi-purified CFTRHis10 in vitro and phosphorylation in the presence of both kinases was additive.</description><creator>Hinkson, Deborah Anne Rochelle.</creator><contributor>Hanrahan, John W.

Anticholinergic (ACH) medications are among biologically plausible and potentially modifiable risk factors of delirium. But the epidemiological findings on its role in hospitalized elderly patients are conflicting. Objectives. To evaluate the association between use of ACH medications and delirium severity and the potential effect-modification on this association by dementia. Methods. A cohort of 278 medical inpatients aged 65 years and over with diagnosed delirium was prospectively followed up with the Delirium Index (DI) every 2--7 days up to 3 weeks in a primary acute care hospital. Their DI scores were associated with measures of ACH medication exposure in the previous day using the mixed linear regression model adjusting for potential confounders or effect modifiers. Results . A total of 47 potential ACH medications were used in the cohort (mean: 1.4 per patient per day). An increase in daily ACH medication exposure of one such medication was on average associated with a subsequent increase in delirium severity of 0.52 DI points (95% CI: 0.3--0.8) after adjusting for dementia, baseline DI score, length of follow-up and concurrent use of non-ACH medications. Dementia did not modify the association. Sensitivity analyses using alternative definitions of ACH medications or excluding antipsychotics did not change the results. Conclusions. Exposure to ACH medications is independently and specifically associated with a subsequent increase in symptom severity of delirium among elderly medical inpatients.</description><creator>Han, Ling, 1955-</creator><contributor>McCusker, Jane (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Psychology, Psychobiology.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><subject>Gerontology.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacy.</subject><title>Use of anticholinergic medications predicts symptom severity of delirium in older medical impatients : a prospective cohort study with repeated measurements</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3x816p25z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rx913r62r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4x51hk97v</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:54:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Epidural steroid injections (ESI) are used as a conservative therapy for treating lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), yet there is no concrete justification for them. Data from a randomized control trial evaluating the effectiveness of ESI in LSS patients was analyzed. Main outcomes were measured by French-translated LSS symptom severity, physical function, and satisfaction scales over 3 months. The first stage of the analyses evaluated psychometric properties of the scales and showed high internal consistency and test-retest reliability. The main analyses addressed ESI efficacy. Repeated measures analysis of variance over the first 3 months showed a marginally statistically significant improvement in symptom severity, physical function, and satisfaction in the ESI group, compared to placebo. Treatment effectiveness tended to decrease over time. Differences between groups were not significant at 6 and 12 months.

The beta isoform of GSK3 may also have a significant role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Tau, a phosphoprotein that normally binds to and promotes the stability of microtubules, is hyper-phosphorylated in the brains of individuals with AD. While a number of protein kinases have been identified that phosphorylate tau in vitro, co-transfection experiments have demonstrated the phosphorylation of tau by GSK3beta in both fibroblasts and COS cells. A greater understanding of the interaction of GSK3beta and tau is necessary to fully understand AD pathology. In this study, GSK3beta and tau were found to be associated in bovine brain by immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein pull-down assay. The direct interaction of GSK3beta and tau was also observed by in vitro binding assay. The tau projection domain was identified as being the GSK3beta-binding region of tau by in vitro binding assay using recombinant tau deletion mutants. Interaction of GSK3beta and tau was not observed using yeast two-hybrid binding assay. This final result may be caused by the limitations of the two-hybrid system, or may indicate the involvement of other molecules in the in vivo interaction of GSK3beta and tau.</description><creator>Cafferty, Patrick William.</creator><contributor>Paudel, H.

Timed trials with four zoological certified reference materials (CRMs), three botanical reference materials (RMs), and a food crop indicated that Se release was quantitative after homogenization or became quantitative within 1 h of digestion at 60°C. The same technique was employed on five animal feed samples. A new model of homogenizer equipped with ceramic homogenizing valve was evaluated in terms of analyte metal contamination levels within the final sample dispersion. Five animal feed samples and four wood pulp samples, were investigated for their content of Cu, Fe and Mn using high-pressure homogenization as the sample preparation technique prior to GF-AAS. Dispersions of dried animal feeds were sub-sampled reliably after 7 days of storage at 4°C. Trials on pulp samples indicated that pulps could be sub-sampled reliably after 1 day of storage.

CDH, CDH+TO, CDH+TO+release of the tracheal occlusion one week before delivery (TR), and unoperated twin controls were compared. TO+/-TR partially normalized the hypoplastic lungs of CDH: they accelerated growth of both lungs and led to structural maturity. Only TO thinned the medial area of small pulmonary arteries closer to control values. Despite TO, TR, and glucocorticoids, lungs from lambs with CDH have dysfunctional type II cells with decreased surfactant levels. Nonetheless, CDH+TO lambs showed normal oxygenation, ventilation, and compliance over untreated CDH, with a clear survival advantage over an eight hour resuscitation. TR one week before delivery had no added benefit in terms of lung function. It appears that surfactant independent mechanisms such as pulmonary growth and structural changes are of foremost importance in relating to improved compliance, oxygenation, and ventilation of CDH+TO animals.</description><creator>Bratu, Ioana.</creator><contributor>Laberge, J-M.

Wasting syndrome (WS) is defined as 10% or more unintentional weight loss from usual body weight. The etiology of WS includes alterations in metabolism, which contribute to loss of lean body mass. Cytokine driven oxidative stress may play a critical role in the metabolic pathways that lead to HIV wasting. Studies have shown that that patients infected with HIV may have a depleted antioxidant (AO) defense system, the integrity of which is needed to efficiently scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS). It has been theorised that low AO intake may contribute to a depressed AO defense system, which drives oxidative stress (OS). In this study we examined 16 subjects who had documented WS but no active infectious process, stratified into 10 to 15% weight loss (n = 7) and over 15% weight loss (n = 9) groups, and reported on oxidative stress measures and AO intake.

China, subject to domestic changes in its quest for a new balance between traditions, socialist notions and market economy, defines its new role in a changing world that drives towards the globalization of trade in goods and services faces. This study examines the Chinese position regarding two aspects significant for both China's domestic process of transition and China's international role: telecommunications and banking services. The first chapter examines the general international framework of the GATS with respect to telecommunications and financial services. This includes, inter alia, a study of the legal framework, comprising in particular the WTO Financial Services Agreement and the Basic Telecommunications Agreement. Chapter Two provides an overview of the Chinese telecommunications and banking sectors. This Chapter focuses on the historical and cultural background influencing the process of domestic deregulation and internationalization of these sectors. Chapter Three features an assessment of the Sino-US WTO Agreement on the telecommunications and banking sectors. In the course of this study, a number of concerns and probable consequences can be identified for both sectors examined. Will "the sleeping giant" move on towards complete market liberalization, or is that prospect merely a castle in the air? This study explores how the China's legal framework governing these two key sectors might unfold.</description><creator>Men, Jing, 1971-</creator><contributor>Janda, Richard (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Telecommunication -- China.</subject><subject>China -- Commercial policy.</subject><subject>World Trade Organization.</subject><subject>Banking law -- China.</subject><subject>Financial services industry -- Law and legislation -- China.</subject><title>Is it a castle in the air? : assessing the Sino-US WTO agreement : from the perspective of telecommunications and banking liberalization</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4f16c444r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ff365703m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z316q3302</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:54:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study questions the effects that discrimination has had on aviation and what changes, if any, can be expected in the near future. The central theme of the study is discrimination, specifically racial discrimination, sex discrimination and age discrimination. Of particular importance is the discriminatory role that various government agencies have played in labeling a person unfit to serve as a pilot simply because that person happens to be a woman, black or has reached a certain chronological age. This study questions the position taken by such institutions as the International Civil Aviation Organization, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Joint Aviation Authorities. Where possible, an attempt has been made to show good leadership on the part of these institutions as well as indicate where good leadership was partially or completely missing. The role the courts have played or failed to play over the years in determining the issues of discrimination in aviation has also been included in the study. Case law is used as extensively as possible to trace the positions taken by plaintiffs and defendants in attempting to change what they perceived as discriminatory or unfair law. The text also includes legislation that addresses issues of discrimination passed by various legislative bodies as well as the efforts of individual organizations, such as the Professional Pilots Federation, the International Federation of Air Line Pilots Associations and others, to end discriminatory practices in aviation.</description><creator>Routh, Robert, 1943-</creator><contributor>Milde, M.

This entails the creation of a free trade agreement that would include virtually all the nations of the Western Hemisphere. However, this is not the first attempt at the creation of trade agreements within the region. From early efforts such as the Latin American Free Trade Agreement to current ones such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and the MERCOSUR, there has been a push for the past 40 years at the use of free trade as a tool for economic development. Nevertheless, traditionally there has been a lack of legal and institutional analysis in the formation of these trading blocs. The same thing appears to be happening in the formation of the FTAA. This thesis analyzes and compares the differing trading blocs in the Western Hemisphere in terms of institutions and capacity to create regional norms and proposes the institutional framework needed for successful regional integration for the FTAA. It then looks at legal obstacles within the Constitutions of select States to the formation of this framework and problems that may arise in jurisdictional uncertainties between the plethora of trading blocs.</description><creator>Silva, Rodrigo.</creator><contributor>de Mestral, Armand (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Economic integration -- North America.</subject><subject>Free trade -- North America.</subject><title>Free trade area of the Americas : the viability of a regional legal order</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rn301309n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9c67wp58p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):39100</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
