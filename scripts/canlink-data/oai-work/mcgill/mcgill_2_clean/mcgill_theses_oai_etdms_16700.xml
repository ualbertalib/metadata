The stimulation of shunt metabolism of glucose during phagocytosis occurs only aerobically. Glycolytic inhibitors strongly inhibit phagocytosis. Cyanide and azide have no effect on the stimulated respiration and glucose oxidation, however, they completely inhibit the stimulated formate oxidation.

Lignin, which constitutes 20-30 % of the dry weight of plants, is formed of phenolic polymers. Phenolic compounds appear to be metabolically inert substances and are considered to be stable and characteristic end products in living plant tissues. No general function can be ascribed to these compounds and no explanation bas been given to their extraordinary diversity. This is possibly one of the reasons why little attention has been given to them by plant physiologists and biochemists in the past.</description><creator>Ibrahim, Ragai.

It has long been known that the red blood cell mass is designed almost exclusively for the purpose of transporting oxygen. Its functional capacity, then, must primarily be determined by the concentration of haemoglobin it maintains in the circulating blood.</description><creator>Gold, Phil.</creator><contributor>Burgen, A.

In the early years of her history, India was a meeting place of different races. With the synthesis of the two main races, the Aryans and the Dravidians, a powerful Hindu civilization and culture were established. Because of its unique continuity and power of assimilation, this civilization forms the main basis of Indian culture. The major achievements of India in ancient times have been in fields such as philosophy, sciences, arts, architecture and sculpture.</description><creator>Gokhale, Sunanda.

The scope and importance of the Theory of the Shell Structure have since increased greatly due to the simplicity of its basic assumptions and flexibility for empiricism. These have resulted in increasing areas of success and consequent remoulding of the theory.</description><creator>Ghosh, Amal. C.</creator><contributor>Fraser, J.

In most cases, however, induction motors make up less than half of the total connected load when more than one power station provides energy to the network. When the natural resources of remote areas in North America and on other continents are developed it seems likely that for some time to come most of these areas will be supplied by local power stations through radial lines rather than by network interconnections. </description><creator>Gevay, Bela.

Since then, numerous investigations have been carried out on various aspects of this problem but the reactions involved are still largely unknown. The investigators seem to agree that off-flavours are due to an enzymatic process because they do not develop in properly blanched vegetables.</description><creator>Fuleki, Tibor.</creator><contributor>David, J.

This thesis examines the process whereby realism evolved in Chaucer's work and particularly the stylistic devices by which it was secured. In order better to understand Chaucer's contribution, we may briefly outline the obvious standards by which realm in characterization has come to be judged since his time.</description><creator>Friend, Myrna.

A study of the relevant literature reveals the patterns of values do charge during the four years of college, as well as after the college years, and that differences between usual and ideal patterns of values have been reported.</description><creator>Fitz-Gerald, Frances.

The levels of these leaf constituents and the yields at harvest were closely correlated, confirming the idea that chemical analysis of the plant at this stage of growth was a useful diagnostic tool.
