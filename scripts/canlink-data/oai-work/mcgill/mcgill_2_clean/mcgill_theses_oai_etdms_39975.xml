Researchers have unsuccessfully attempted three definitions of VR. The first, a definition by technological architecture, focuses on the different types of systems that have been developed. The second, a definition by human architecture, proposes that VR consists of psychological phenomena that users experience such as immersion and presence. The third, a definition by language architecture, uses the popular metaphor of cyberspace as a location to describe the experience. Although each attempt falls short of delivering a complete definition of VR, expanding the parameters the VR metaphor holistically promises to extend research of this new technology. The study of metaphorical language has progressed from previous reductionistic proposals that metaphors are merely a side effect of language, to current holistic approaches that suggest metaphors are central to human communication and understanding. Since changing a metaphor changes the concept, the choice of a VR metaphor is crucial. Cyberspace has the potential to be both the greatest threat and the greatest achievement of human society. The current metaphor of cyberspace is incomplete, focusing only on the location. This thesis proposes to extend the cyberspatial metaphor to launch, destination, and re-entry in order to better conceptualize VR. Researchers can reexamine previously ignored human elements and attempt to understand how to safely send cybernauts from reality to cyberspace and back.</description><creator>Finkelstein, Adam B.

This thesis examines the developments of the Austrian Army during the interwar period and focuses on the defence plans compiled by the Austrian Chief of the General Staff, Field Marshall Alfred Jansa. From the moment he assumed his position in the Federal Ministry of Defence, Jansa set out to create an Army capable of defending its borders against Nazi Germany. As long as he was Chief of the General Staff, he promised that any German attack would meet with Austrian military resistance. This thesis considers an aspect of Austrian History, which English-language scholarship has largely neglected. This thesis provides a critical evaluation of the preparedness of the Austrian Army and the feasibility of resistance in March 1938.</description><creator>Festa, Janice.</creator><contributor>Hoffmann, P.

To do so, we consider two problems connected and coextensive to the second part of the XVI century. The first one that extends over the first two chapters analyzes the way by which the religious wars of the era have found their justification in God. In the first chapter, we try to analyze the discursive vector of the divine ire whereas in the second chapter, we investigate the relationship between the tide of a battle and the elect sign that is supposed to give to the winner. The second problem, that deals with various attempts of pacification, forms the third chapter of this paper. It focuses on the efforts undertaken by some "well intentioned" jurists to end "fratricidal" wars by royal by-laws (edits) whose unfortunate results are to stir up hatred among different ideological factions. The fourth chapter is a reflection on some criticism stated by XVI century thinkers who perceived actual wars as lacking religious foundation, and even as a carnage where nobody really knew why the fighting was going on. Finally, we put forward some hypotheses on the specificity of the Essais in the sociodiscursive context of this age.</description><creator>Boucher, François-Emmanuël.</creator><contributor>Desrosiers-Bonin, Diane (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>War -- Religious aspects.</subject><subject>Montaigne, Michel de, 1533-1592 -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><title>Montaigne et l'herméneutique des guerres de religion</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tx31qk76m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rx913r77c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:76537300d</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:00:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This work explores the interreligious paradigms proposed by Sri Lankan theologian Aloysius Pieris from a liberationist methodological standpoint. Pieris' paradigms uncover the exclusivist tendencies of some liberation theology toward 'religion' and the anti-liberative tendencies of the inculturationist school of interreligious dialogue. The Christ-against-Religion paradigm delineates how some Latin American liberation theology constructs a sharp dichotomy between "liberative faith" and "popular religion." The Christ-of-Religion paradigm of the Brahminic Ashram movement in India is focused on personal liberation without regard for systemic poverty and oppression. Pieris has endeavoured to bridge the dichotomy between liberation and inculturation through what I have labelled a method of prophetic asceticism . Using insights from feminist theology, I argue that Pieris' dialectical method subtly reactivates the oppositional Christ-against-Religion paradigm in his theology. I propose the Exodus wilderness as an intrinsic part of the liberative process and to complement Pieris' dialectics. The wilderness is a landscape of survival for God's vanquished people; a landscape of doubt that can bring forth the bread of heaven.</description><creator>Bellemare, Mario.</creator><contributor>Skerrett, Kathleen Roberts (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Pieris, Aloysius.</subject><subject>Liberation theology.</subject><subject>Wilderness (Theology)</subject><subject>Christianity and culture -- Developing countries.</subject><subject>Asceticism.</subject><title>Prophetic asceticism in the wilderness : dilemmas of liberation and inculturation in the interreligious paradigms of Aloysius Pieris S.J.</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mc87ps44f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/76537300d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Religious Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qj72p909m</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:00:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Pour la constitution de ce sujet, je suis partie du contexte de l'etude plutot que de son objet. L'Afrique m'est apparue comme un choix logique pour deux raisons principales. La premiere, d'ordre personnel, est que les personnes qui me sont les plus cheres sont, chacunes a leur maniere, proches du continent africain. Sous leur influence, j'ai developpe un interet certain pour les cultures et les problemes de l'Afrique noire. Ce penchant s'est transforme en conviction lorsque, dans les aleas de leur carriere professionnelle, mes parents ont ete mute au Mali il y a deux ans. Ce demenagement m'a permis de constater la situation de l'Afrique par quelques voyages sur le continent. Ces experiences me permettent aujourd'hui affirmer que l'Afrique occupe une part importante de ma vie et de mes centres d'interet. La seconde raison a l'origine de ce devoir: Je pense qu'en adoptant une demarche critique vis-a-vis des rapports socioculturels, je pourrais construire un environnement intellectuel stimulant qui contribuerait a remettre en question nombre de presupposes que l'on tient trop souvent pour vrais et definitifs.

Using the Foucauldian notions of discursive regularities, the study of materialization and meaning in the 'body that matters' by Judith Butler, along with Baudrillard's definition of simulacra and simulation, this thesis traces the diverse constructions and significations of the 'names' and 'bodies' surrounding Evita's life, the treatment of her death, and the period which followed. Throughout the course of this analysis, her names and bodies are subjected to the conception of 'myth' as defined by Roland Barthes, bringing to light the entwining of factual and fictional narratives that continually supply them. Derrida's notion of differance is used to illustrate the resistance to closure in the histories/stories which emerge from her once single and singular existence and its infinity of derivations.</description><creator>Bejerman, Ingrid.</creator><contributor>Kaite, Berkeley (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Perón, Eva, 1919-1952</subject><title>Framing a pose in immortality : discourse, myth, representation in the death and life of Eva Perón</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q524jq725.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5q47rq67h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Graduate Communications Program</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6w924d656</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:00:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The objective of the present research was to determine more precisely whether the first novel of writers of the lyric generation reflected the spirit particular to that generation, in what way and to what extent. In other words, the present work consisted of either confirming or invalidating Ricard's hypothesis by analysing it in the light of the literary works themselves. Twenty-three novels were chosen according to the year of their publication (1967--1975) and the age of the authors at the time of publication (between 21 and 31 years). An analysis of the works clearly confirmed Ricard's intuition: egocentricity and introspection, revolution and reinvention of literary style and narcissism were consistently present in the novels studied. These characteristics stem from a clear dominance of the autodiegetic narration style, the control of elements of time and space by the narrator, who is often personally identifiable with the author and finally from an upheaval of scriptural standards. The thematic of the style of writing as an outlet, a pleasure or an experimentation is ever present. The narrators themselves dominate the stage and their narcissistic personalities are evident throughout.</description><description>According to Francois Ricard in La generation lyrique: essai sur la vie at l'oeuvre des premiers-nes du baby-boom , the group born in Quebec during the decade immediately following the Second World War is primarily characterized by "[...] un amour eperdu de soi-meme, une confiance categorique en ses propres desirs et ses propres actions, et le sentiment d'un pouvoir illimite sur le monde [...]" (p. 8).</description><creator>Gratton, Hélène.</creator><contributor>Ricard, Francois (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>French-Canadian fiction -- Québec (Province) -- History and criticism.</subject><subject>French-Canadian fiction -- 20th century -- History and criticism.</subject><title>Premièrs romans de la génération lyrique</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/47429c23f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6w924d656</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x920fz65m</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:00:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study examined the efficacy of conjoint behavioural consultation (CBC) with children evidencing conduct problems, the impact of CBC in enhancing parental knowledge of behavioural principles, and whether knowledge of behavioural principles is related to improved parenting skills. An A/B design was used and participants included 5 boys (ages 3, 3, 5, 5, and 6) and their parents. Children evidenced improvements in their target behaviours from baseline to treatment (effect sizes = -0.54 to -2.10). Overall, children's social skills increased (Reliable Change Indices [RCI] = -3.66 to 3.05), problem behaviours decreased, and externalizing difficulties decreased (RCI = -0.24 to -3.74). Parents used more praise, less critical statements, and less no-opportunity commands following treatment. Parental knowledge of behavioural principles improved significantly for 2 parents (RCI's = 0.00 to 8.77). Also, increased parental knowledge of behavioural principles was related to increased use of praise (r = 0.95, p &lt; .05).

Given the linguistic and thematic complexity of this literary work, such approach is a mere effort to discover clues for an interpretation of it. Working toward this goal, the first chapter of the thesis unfolds the search for origins of the secret doctrine of Israel at the beginning of the Christian era, focusing specifically on the symbolism of the fish, Clam's role, the white goddess's function, Gabriel's role as the embodiment of Jehovah and Beelzebub and the presence of the new religion following the weddings. The second chapter talks about the aesthetic of repentance as formulated by Baltasar Gracian and present in the work of sor Juana Ines de la Cruz; the relationship between the latter and the narrator of Los peces, the conception of art as a deception of the senses, as well as the narrator's androgynous voice or voices. Finally, the third chapter concentrates on the poetics of Fernandez's text. More concretely, the spirituality of the narrator and his or her relationship with the writer. The relationship between desire, language, and religion, and the analysis of space are also the focal point in this chapter. The conclusion summarizes what was studied throughout the thesis and raise questions.</description><creator>Gudiño, María Lourdes.</creator><contributor>Magallon, Jesus Perez (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Fernández, Sergio E.

Kadye Molodowsky was one of the most prominent of the modern Yiddish women poets. Her biography is a typical summary of the modernization of Eastern European Jewry in the early twentieth century. Molodowsky was a leading figure in Yiddish cultural life in interbellum Poland. As a writer, her primary affiliation was with the Literarishe bleter (Literary Leaves, 1924--1939). This periodical, founded by prominent Yiddish intellectuals in Warsaw, became the world tribune of secular Yiddish culture. Molodowsky's association with this high-profile publication placed her at the centre of the vibrant Jewish literary, cultural, and social life of the time. What follows, is an annotated bibliography of her publications and work about her in Literarishe bleter, from her debut there in 1925 until her departure for the US in 1935.</description><creator>Gonshor, Anna, 1949-</creator><date>1997</date><subject>Yiddish poetry -- 20th century -- History and criticism.</subject><subject>Molodowsky, Kadia, 1894-1975 -- Bibliography.</subject><subject>Poland -- Intellectual life -- 1918-1945.</subject><title>Kadye Molodowsky in Literarishe bleter, 1925-35 : annotated bibliography</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j098zd104.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3b591b35w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Jewish Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:br86b5297</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:00:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Governments started regulating the telecommunications industry, firstly, because the governments thought that the industry possessed the characteristics of what is generally known as 'natural monopoly' and, secondly, to protect the users of telephone services from potential abuses that are associated with the monopoly power. The governmental intervention went so far that, with the exception of few countries, virtually everywhere in the world telecommunications services were provided by the government departments of Post Telephone and Telegraph (PTT). However, with the technological advances made in the telecommunications industry, the industry can no longer be characterized as 'natural monopoly,' and, therefore, the primary rationale for regulating telecommunications industry is undermined. Despite the technological advancements and the move to deregulate telecommunications industry prevalent elsewhere in the world, some developing countries are adamant in maintaining their monopoly over the provision of telecommunications services. What was regulated to protect the consumers against the monopoly abuses is now regulated to extract monopoly profits from the consumers. This paper adopts the premise that whether governments regulate an industry, or deregulate it, or introduce competition in it, they should strictly adhere to the objective of governmental intervention, that is, consumer welfare.</description><creator>Wilson, Joseph, 1968-</creator><contributor>Janda, Richard A.

One of the Islamic educational institutions famous for its Islamic approach is the pesantren. This institution, however, is facing major challenges at present and is being asked to update, develop and change many of its programs in order to enable its graduates to participate more fully in Indonesian national life, particularly in the field of national development. As a result, some pesantrens began modernizing their educational systems. The modernization process is accomplished through the adoption of the national education system alongside the classical system, thus providing students with secular subjects and skills training together with religious education. As is to be expected, this modernization effort has created a number of problems for pesantrens such as lack of funds, finding skilled teachers for the secular and skill subjects, building the necessary facilities and creating the needed administrative apparatus.

Several statistical tests were used to determine which factor(s) affected their opinion. It was found that American counsellors and counsellors who are recovering alcoholics tend to agree with the disturbed personality theory, adopt the codependence concept more readily, and view wives of alcoholics as more pathological than do the Canadian counsellors and the counsellors of a professional background. Further research is suggested to explore the possible cultural differences in the two countries as well as the apparent benefit of having counsellors of a professional background in treatment centers.</description><creator>White, Chantal.</creator><contributor>Dobson, Florence (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Duder, S.

However, no scientifically-derived guidelines, using the INR, for the surgical management of this group of patients exists. In the first part of this study, the protocols followed by oral surgeons, when treating patients receiving warfarin, and who require dental extractions were established by performing a mail survey. The results of the survey illustrated that although the majority of oral surgeons use the INR, most of them use the INR along with the PT and only one fifth of them use this measure alone. In the second part of this study, dental extractions were performed on rabbits which were anticoagulated to various INR levels. The results of this study strongly suggest that dental extractions may be safely performed on subjects receiving oral anticoagulants using routine measures for local hemostasis.</description><creator>Troulis, Maria J.</creator><contributor>Head, T.

Such services require the use of high-quality low bit-rate coders to efficiently code the speech signal before transmission or storage. The majority of such coders employ algorithms that are based on Code-Excited Linear Prediction (CELP). The goal of this thesis is to improve the quality of CELP coded speech, while keeping the basic coding format intact. The quality improvement is focused on voiced speech segments. A Pitch Pulse Averaging (PPA) algorithm has been developed to enhance the periodicity of such segments, where during steady state voicing the pitch pulse waveforms in the excitation signal evolve slowly in time. The PPA algorithm extracts a number of such pitch pulse waveforms from the past excitation, aligns them, and then averages them to produce a new pitch pulse waveform with reduced noise. The PPA algorithm has been simulated and tested on a floating point C-simulation of the G.729 8 kbps CS-ACELP coder. Objective tests verified that the algorithm contributes most during steady state voiced speech. Thus a simple voicing decision mechanism has been developed to deactivate the algorithm during unvoiced segments and voicing onsets of speech. Results verified that the algorithm has generally improved the periodicity of voiced segments by reducing the average of the weighted mean-squared error. While we were able to demonstrate improvements in objective measures, informal listening tests indicate that the already high perceptual quality of G.729 is generally not audibly altered. Nonetheless, the technique may be useful for improving the quality at lower rates, particularly for next generation low bit-rate coders operating near 4 kbps.</description><creator>Papacostantinou, Costantinos.</creator><contributor>Kabal, Peter (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Improved pitch modelling for low bit-rate speech coders</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rf55z9732.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0c483m111</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x346d613r</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:00:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>One of the key factors in ensuring safe slopes in open pit mines is the control of the groundwater flow within the slope. When analyzing the flow regime and its characteristics, traditional numerical methods designed for soil-like materials may not always apply. In the present thesis, the two-dimensional finite element code FlowD was developed to analyze steady-state seepage through fractured rock masses, under saturated conditions. The program provides the user with two modelling options: porous (soil) materials, or fractured rock masses. The double-porosity model was incorporated in the code, in order to better model flow through anisotropic, heterogeneous fractured rock masses, where Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions can apply. FlowD program calculates total pressure head, flow gradients and velocities within the specified domain. Drains, drainage galleries and wells, as well as aquifer recharge can be simulated. A real large-scale case study, with complex geological features has been simulated in order to demonstrate the application of the double porosity model. Three different scenarios have been modeled for the same slope, which are natural groundwater regime, vertical well simulation, and drainage galleries simulation. The results show good agreement with the predictions of both the consultant and the mine's engineering division.</description><creator>Priscu, Doina Maria.</creator><contributor>Mitri, Hani S.

Unfortunately, the search tools currently available for retrieving and filtering such information remain inadequate in balancing relevance and comprehensiveness. This work proposes a new Internet search paradigm. Simple user models are first combined with search specifications (the "user needs"), to form an Enhanced User Need (EUN). Uniform Resource Agents are then constructed to filter information, based on the EUN parameters. Finally, a knowledge-based system is developed to suggest those agents that are best for a researcher with a given background and search requirements. Two experiments show that users can obtain better search results from a set of HTML documents by invoking the agents recommended by the knowledge-based system, than by conducting a traditional keyword-based search. This work thus demonstrates that the use of user models, filtering agents and a knowledge-based system improves search results and may be extended to improve Internet information retrieval.</description><creator>Newell, Sima C.</creator><contributor>Lowther, D.

A synthesis method is proposed for finding the best control parameters, such as the impedance parameters and the desired trajectory, for a robotic manipulator which has to execute a compliant task. The control parameters are derived from an optimization method. The optimization function simulates the task execution and evaluates the performance according to the specified task goals, which are expressed as inequalities on position, velocity and force responses. These goals are built in order to obtain the control parameters that will ensure the highest robustness in oscillation and uncertainty cases. The non-experimental method builds its results from decoupled linear impedance models of the robot and the environment. The synthesis is applied to three specific tasks performed on the live line maintenance of distribution network at Hydro-Quebec, an electric utility company.</description><creator>O'Reilly, Philippe.</creator><contributor>Buehler, Martin (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Planning robotic tasks for impedance controllers in oscillating and uncertain environments</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pr76f549g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cz30pv57c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pk02cc697</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:00:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Genetic mapping of pDS15 revealed that this cosmid clone carries the Sinorhizobium meliloti TCA cycle genes mdh, sucCDAB, sdhAB and part of lpdA. Three genes (mdh, sucC , and sucA) were completely sequenced and submitted to GenBank. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the TCA cycle genes encoded on pDS15 were aligned and found to be highly homologous with other closely related rhizobial species. S. meliloti cells grown in LBmc express the mdh-sucCDAB operon as one transcript, based on RT-PCR results. Alternative sigma factor sigma54 was not found to have a role in mdh-sucCDAB expression. Despite considerable effort, we have not been able to isolate sucA mutants via random transposon Tn5tac1 mutagenesis to date. Homologous recombination between a plasmid-borne sucA::Tn5 and wild-type S. meliloti sucA failed to generate a bona fide mutant, as revealed by Southern blot analysis. Plasmid pDS15 was mutagenized with transposons Tn5, Tn5tac1, and Tn5-B20. Three Tn5-B20 insertions were mapped to mdh, sucD, and sucA respectively, and preliminary gene expression studies were done.</description><creator>Meek, David J.

A related objective was to explore the relationship between the family's disclosure of traumatic events and the children's play. The research was conducted among 21 Algerian and West and Central African children. The methodology was based on both qualitative and quantitative methods. The play of children from a community and a clinical group was compared to identify play indicators that were potentially indicative of positive mental health. Results suggest that indicators of play structure may be more important than indicators of play content in identifying children with potential mental health difficulties as a result of trauma. In particular, a flexible approach to trauma and a modulated approach to the disclosure of traumatic events may be related to positive mental health. These results suggest that this non-intrusive directed play interview is a valid and culturally sensitive instrument for assessing the verbal and non-verbal representations of war trauma in refugee children.</description><creator>Measham, Toby Jane.</creator><contributor>Rousseau, Cecile (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Psychology, Psychometrics.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Mental Health.</subject><title>Children's representations of war trauma and family separation in play</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sf2686922.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f7623f36d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychiatry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n009w4138</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:00:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In capture-recapture studies, the estimate of the size of the population is biased when members differ in the probability of capture by any source.

As a cell surface receptor, the Dag1 gene product dystroglycan links the intracellular cytoskeleton to the extracellular basement membrane in many cells. Thought to act as a structural protein dystroglycan may also participate in signal transduction. This study aims to better understand the role of dystroglycan during kidney morphogenesis. I hypothesised that a lack of dystroglycan in the precursor cells of the kidney could lead to altered kidney growth. Chimaeric mice deficient in dystroglycan were generated to test this hypothesis. A total of 38 chimaeras had genetic contribution and histological analysis performed on their kidneys. Of the chimaeras analysed, only four demonstrated altered kidney morphology. Further histological, immunohistochemical and biochemical studies established whether a link existed between this morphology and a deficiency in dystroglycan. Normal laminar architecture and nephrotic structures of the kidneys suggest that normal kidney organogenesis occurred in the absence of dystroglycan. The pattern and expression level of basement membrane components suggests that normal basement membrane formation also occured in the absence of dystroglycan. Biochemical analysis revealed that although dystroglycan protein levels correlate with the genetic contribution of the chimaeric kidney, it does not correlate with the altered morphology. Ureter blockage causing hydronephrosis can explain the morphology observed. A deficiency of dystroglycan in the ureter may in turn have caused this blockage. These findings suggest that dystroglycan is not necessary for kidney organogenesis, since kidney development occurred normally in all 38 chimaeric animals irrespective of genetic contribution.</description><creator>Melian, Nadia.</creator><contributor>Carbonetto, Salvatore (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Kidneys -- Anatomy.</subject><subject>Mice -- Morphogenesis.</subject><subject>Membrane, Basement.</subject><title>Basement membrane composition of Dag1 null chimaeric mice kidneys</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/08612q40z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gb19f7740</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:w6634559r</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:00:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) in plants is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. We have proposed in this study that the mitochondrial-encoded chimeric peptide thought to be responsible for cytoplasmic male sterility in Polima system could function as a dominant male sterility inducer when expressed in the nucleus and targeted to the mitochondria. Transgenic plants expressing such mitochondrial targeting constructs exhibited reduction of pollen production that was characterized in fertile Westar (nap ) and restored fertile Westar (pol) plants by homeotic transformation of floral organs and in male-sterile Westar (pol) plants by a reduction in pollen production with shortening of the stamens. Genetic and molecular analysis has shown that the phenotypic changes were correlated with the effective genetic transmission of the inserted transgene through female gametes. Most significantly, we have found that differences in floral morphology induced by transgene expression between pol CMS and fertile Westar plants might be related to differences in transcriptional activity of the APETALA3 MADS box gene. We suggest that the alterations in floral morphology that accompany CMS in several plant species might be due to effects of mitochondria on transcriptional activity of floral organ identity genes.</description><creator>Mahe, Laetitia.</creator><contributor>Brown, Gregory (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Plant mitochondria.</subject><subject>Rape (Plant) -- Cytogenetics.</subject><subject>Cytoplasmic male sterility.</subject><title>Import of chimeric proteins into plant mitochondria</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sn00b0608.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w6634559r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g445cg094</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:00:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Sulfinimines are important chiral auxiliaries for asymmetric synthesis of amines. Enantiopure sulfinimines can be prepared from the direct condensation of enantiopure sulfinamides with aldehydes or ketones. However, few sulfinamides are available in enantiomerically pure form. To make a wider range of sulfinamides, we examined hydrolase-catalyzed resolution of N-acylsulfinamides. Using a fast screening method, we identified several hydrolases that catalyzed the hydrolysis of N-chloroacetyl-p-toluenesulfinamide with high to moderate selectivity. Scale-up reaction identified proteinase from Bacillus subtilis var. biotecus A that reacted at the carbonyl position and showed high enantioselectivity (E &gt; 150) favoring the (R)-N-chloroacetyl-p-toluenesulfinamide. This hydrolase provided a new route to enantiopure p-chlorobenzenesulfinamide, benzenesulfinamide, p-methoxybenzenesulfinamide and 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfinamide that cannot be prepared from current methods. We also identified proteinase, bacterial, which hydrolyzed N-acylsulfinamide at the sulfinyl yielding p-toluenesulfinic acid. The reaction occurred with enantioselectivity (E' ~ 75) and provided enantiopure (S)-N-chloroacetyl-p-toluenesulfinamide.* *Please refer to dissertation for diagram.</description><creator>Magloire, Vladimir P.</creator><contributor>Kazlauskas, Romas J.

Two types of follow-up teams, hospital affiliated and community organisations, were compared in our study for levels of burnout and job satisfaction. As well, predictor variables such as stressors (daily hassles), work environment perceptions, caseload characteristics and employee characteristics were included to examine whether they explain the variance of burnout and job satisfaction. 25 staff members from four community follow-up teams completed questionnaires. Significant differences were found between teams on levels of burnout and job satisfaction. Work pressure was demonstrated as a significant predictor of burnout.
