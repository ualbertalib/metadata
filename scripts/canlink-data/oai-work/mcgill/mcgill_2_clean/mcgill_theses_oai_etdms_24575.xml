Italica) and cauliflower (Brassica oleraceae L. var. botrytis L.) to evaluate legume species as interseedings in vegetable production. White clover (Trifolium repens L.), red clover (T. pratense L.), yellow sweet clover (Melilotus officinalis L.), hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.) and crimson clover (T. incarnatum L.) were seeded 4-5 weeks after an early planting of broccoli and a late planting of cauliflower. Crop yields, forage biomass, weed biomass and percent fall ground cover were recorded. A dry year coupled with difficulties in applying the treatments resulted in low forage biomass. Hairy vetch yielded the most within the early broccoli planting system. High rainfall the next year resulted in high biomass yields. Over the two year study, hairy vetch and crimson clover emerged as the two most productive species. Significant effects on fall weed biomass were observed with broccoli in the second year of the study, where interseeded plots reduced weed populations by at least 66%. No evidence was seen of weed suppression by interseedings prior to harvest. Crop yields were not affected by interseedings. All interseeded treatments provided the minimum of 30% ground cover required to help reduce erosion.</description><creator>Foulds, Chantal M.

Individually caged broiler breeders were fed diets with or without added fat during 19-wk reproductive period. In Experiment 1, only the females were subjected to dietary treatments: control (no added fat), 3% animal-vegetable fat blend (A-V fat, 3% corn oil (CO)), while the males received a non-added fat diet. In Experiment 2, only the males were fed diets containing 0 or 3% of either A-V fat or CO while the females were provided a non-added-fat diet. In Experiment 1, added dietary fat produced significantly higher fertility and early embryonic livability. In Experiment 2, inclusion of 3% CO in the males' diets significantly increased late embryo livability and total embryo survival resulting in a significantly higher hatchability. There were no differences in semen characteristics among dietary treatments. These data indicate that the contribution of the male is not restricted to the fertilization of eggs but is also related to embryonic livability. The addition of fat significantly affected the fatty acid composition of the phospholipid fraction of the spermatozoa cells.</description><creator>Gilbert, André</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Broilers (Poultry) -- Reproduction.</subject><subject>Broilers (Poultry) -- Experiments.</subject><subject>Broilers (Poultry) -- Nutrition.</subject><subject>Food of animal origin -- Fat content.</subject><title>The value of dietary fats for improving reproductive performance of broiler breeder chickens /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2227mr019.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0k225c19h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Animal Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bc386k56x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Liquid hog manure (LHM) obtained from the Macdonald College farm was used in experiments aimed at (a) reducing the odor associated with LHM during handling and (b) conserving the fertilizer capacity of LHM. Various chemical treatments and sphagnum moss (SM) were evaluated to achieve the above objectives. Direct acidification to $&lt;$ pH 5.0, sphagnum moss (SM) and its combination with aluminum sulfate (AS) resulted in significant (p $&lt;$ 0.05) reduction in ammonia losses during storage of LHM. The SM and SM/AS combination also significantly (p $&lt;$ 0.05) reduced both odor presence and offensiveness. Gas chromatographic (GC) and GC/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis indicated the absence of certain malodor compounds and lower peak areas of certain compounds in the SM and SM/AS treatments when compared to the controls. Investigations with barley seeding revealed that treatments which reduced the malodor of the LHM did not significantly (p $&lt;$ 0.05) affect the nitrogen fertilization capacity of the LHM, as indicated by plant dry matter yield.</description><creator>Akochi-Koblé, Emmanuel</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Swine -- Manure -- Handling.</subject><subject>Farm manure, Liquid -- Odor control.</subject><title>Evaluation of sphagnum moss and chemical compounds for management of odor and use of liquid hog manure</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7p88ch81r.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bc386k56x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5t34sk70v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis on literary writing consists of a critic and of a fiction.

The first lens is a short rod which has a graded acoustic velocity profile in the radial direction giving it the ability to focus acoustic waves. Electron probe microanalyses, optical refractive index measurements and acoustic velocity measurements are used to characterize the lens. The ray acoustics approach is used for the theoretical interpretation and the focussing behavior is visualized with a Schlieren system. Potential applications of the lens are discussed. The cylindrical lens consists of a lead zirconate titanate (PZT) coated wire or optical fibre. The fabrication and evaluation of the lens is described. Ultrasonic measurements of miniature transducers and electronically controllable deflection are demonstrated. A novel laser ablation patterning technique is used to make an interdigital transducer with a 20$ mu$m resolution on the outer electrode of the lens for special applications. Finally, possible applications of the cylindrical lens are outlined.</description><creator>Nicolle, Alain J.

But, in addition to economic considerations, equal stress needs to be given to social, cultural, and environmental factors. With these concerns in mind, the Centre for Minimum Cost Housing at McGill University has developed a set of planning guidelines for the design of sites and services projects in the Indian context. This thesis assesses the physical and economic implications of using this set of planning guidelines. Following these, four alternative layouts were prepared and evaluated through graphic and quantitative methods of analysis for their land-use and infrastructure efficiency. The study shows that the use of these planning guidelines can significantly improve land-use efficiency and the environmental quality of sites and services projects and still be at par with the economic performance of conventional planning.</description><creator>Torres, Roberto Hernando</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Building sites -- Planning</subject><subject>Human settlements -- Planning</subject><subject>Land use -- Planning</subject><title>The economic implications of using planning guidelines in the design of sites and services projects /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vq27zp58v.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mg74qn13g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9p290b651</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We propose an approach for representing an object by its constituent parts and their spatial connections. The approach is based on a set of primitive volumes called geons. We utilize the edge-junction graph of an object range image as input. This is a graph whose nodes are the junctions and whose arcs are the edges detected from the range image. The three-dimensional geometrical information at T junctions allows us to group pairs of corresponding T junctions. By following occluding, limb, concave edges and linking pairs of corresponding T junctions, we decompose the edge-junction graph into different subgraphs. Each of these subgraphs then corresponds to a constituent part of the object. For each part, edge curvature and type guide us to an inference regarding the corresponding geon shape. Also, the spatial connections among these parts can be deduced from concave edges and pairs of corresponding T junctions. Finally, the object is described by a directed graph whose nodes represent the part shapes and whose directed arcs represent the spatial connections.</description><creator>Nguyen, Quang Loc</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Geon-based object representation using range imaging</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3n204033v.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9p290b651</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h415pb56z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis examines Derek Parfit's theory of personal identity. Parfit argues that what matters in the continued existence of persons through time is psychological connectedness and continuity (relation R), and that the identity relation does not matter. He makes this claim through a series of arguments which, he says, inevitably lead to the conclusions that relation R is the only relation that matters, in all cases. I argue that Parfit does not convincingly demonstrate that relation R is in fact all that matters. In examining each of Parfit's arguments, I show that it is possible to draw conclusions that are inconsistent with those drawn by him. I argue that this shows Parfit's position to be an arbitrary one. If Parfit's arguments do not necessarily lead to the conclusion that relation R is all that matters in questions of survival, then his theory is not an adequate solution to the problem of personal identity.</description><creator>Newburg, Anne</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Self</subject><subject>Parfit, Derek -- Views on identity</subject><subject>Identity (Philosophical concept)</subject><title>Derek Parfit and personal identity : is Parfit's relation R all that matters?</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1g05fc89m.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h415pb56z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Philosophy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zc77sr25s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Particle circulation patterns and drying in aerated vibrated beds of large particles were studied experimentally. The beds were vibrated vertically at frequencies up to 25 Hz and half-amplitudes up to 4 mm. Molecular sieve particles, alumina particles and glass beads with average diameters ranging from 925 $ mu$m to 2300 $ mu$m were used as model particles. Particle circulation experiments were conducted with air in cross-flow as well as conventional up-flow with respect to the direction of the applied vibration. It was found that vibration intensity and aeration rate acted in opposition to restrict the range of useful operation of cross-flow aerated vibrated beds. Overall mass transfer coefficients were calculated using surface drying data with molecular sieve particles. However, it was found that vibration had no obvious effect on the overall mass transfer coefficients in the range of operation investigated. While augmentation in the drying rate (up to 40% over the static bed value) was observed in vibrated beds, no further effect of vibration on the drying rate was apparent once the bed became fully vibro-fluidized. Vibration also had a limited but positive effect on the gas-to-particle heat transfer rates. The aeration rate was found to have a much stronger effect on drying, mass and heat transfer rates than vibration in the parameter ranges studied.</description><creator>Eccles, Teresa H.

In addition, although the literature suggests that different revisers making changes to the same instructional materials will yield different revisions, little research has been conducted to confirm this. The present study addressed these two issues by having four instructional designers, acting as revisers, make revisions to a draft version of an instructional presentation while thinking aloud. A coding scheme was applied to the think-aloud protocols. Revisions were sorted using a product attribute categorization system consisting of three main categories central to evaluating instructional materials. The results suggest that revisers do give a considerable amount of attention to learner data when revising materials. In addition, there was a great deal of uniformity among the revisions that were generated by the different revisers.</description><creator>Duy, Nicole</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Teaching -- Aids and devices -- Evaluation</subject><title>Revising instructional materials : uniformity among four revisers and their attention to learner data</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jw827c92n.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b5644s75c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x059c867m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The thesis suggests a way in which the peace movement can make itself attractive to citizens. It begins with the assumption that the movement should satisfy some of their personal needs. One such need is that of relief from the pains of anxiety. Drawing upon Heidegger, the thesis outlines two of these pains--impotence and unheimlichkeit--and shows why we experience them. Then, using Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, it explains why true friendship is a positive response to the pains. True friends further each other's courage, a virtue whose possession helps them to weather impotence. True friends are, in fundamental ways, the same as one another: Their partial identity counters the effects of non-humans whose radical otherness makes the partners feel unheimlich. A movement which promotes true friendship within its ranks--and publicizes this fact--will likely attract new members and have success in retaining old ones. The last chapter discusses, in concrete terms, how friendship among movement members can be fostered.</description><creator>Forman, Gideon</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Peace movements -- Canada</subject><subject>Friendship -- Philosophy</subject><subject>Pacifists -- Recruiting</subject><title>Friendship in the Peace Movement</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vt150k38r.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x059c867m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Philosophy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wh246t184</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Golgi apparatus is organized into a characteristic differentiated stack in all eukaryotic cells. During mitosis, the Golgi apparatus disassembles into smaller clustered vesicles lacking recognizable cisternae whereupon they recombine to form typical stacks in each of the daughter cells (Lucocq et al., 1987). Paiment et al. (1989) have demonstrated that dispersed (unstacked) Golgi fragments will reconstitute into a functional stacked Golgi apparatus when microinjected into Xenopus laevis oocytes. Disrupted hepatic Golgi fractions (Gi) were isolated on discontinuous sucrose gradients and incubated at 37$ sp circ$C in the presence or absence of calf brain cytosol, ATP, and GTP$ gamma$S with or without pretreatment by N-ethylmaleimide.

This thesis studies the technique of film montage through the work of Andrei Tarkovsky and the possibilities it offers to the process of architectural conception. A general outline of the development of the perspective tools of representation in architecture lead to an understanding of the significance of the cinematographic image in the context of the history of projection. Montage in the tradition of Surrealism placed an emphasis on the potential power of poetic evocation between its elements. Comparing the narrative forms of three film-makers, the "surrealist montage" of Luis Bunuel, the "intellectual montage" of Sergie Eisenstein, and the temporal modulation in the films of Tarkovsky, this thesis examines different ways to qualify cinematographic space which affect the spatial and temporal experience of the spectator and offer the possibility of a redefinition of ritual in architecture.</description><creator>Pelletier, Louise, 1963-</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Cinematography</subject><subject>Perspective</subject><subject>Architectural rendering.</subject><title>L'espace métaphorique du montage cinématographique : vers un nouveau rituel architectural</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fn107021t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fn107020j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5999n451j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Daily event data on a group of sub-Saharan African nations from 1975 to 1982 are analyzed to determine the nature of the short term relationship between acts of regime repression and dissident reaction. The results support the Relative Deprivation prediction of an "Inverted U" relationship between acts of repression and acts of Turmoil. Conversely, the concurrence of "U-shape" and "Negative Linear" relationships between repression and acts of Internal War suggest that a mixture of frustration-aggression and cost-benefit analysis may affect dissident behaviour. Moreover, the simultaneous strength of the deprivation indicators and the weakness of the mobilization indicators support the conclusion that a synthesis of the two main approaches to the study of social movement behaviour is in order.</description><creator>O'Duffy, Brendan</creator><contributor>Eschen, Donald Von (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Pinard, Maurice (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1989</date><subject>Political persecution -- Africa, Sub-Saharan</subject><subject>Government, Resistance to -- Africa, Sub-Saharan</subject><subject>Africa, Sub-Saharan -- Politics and government -- 1960-</subject><title>Regime repression and dissident reaction : sub-Saharan Africa from 1975 to 1982</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mk61rj140.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5999n451j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Sociology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x920fx93k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The present work attempts to determine the feasibility of the accelerometer as an end-point control sensor for the basic oxygen steelmaking process. In this study, two series of laboratory scale BOF simulations were performed. In the first series, the accelerometer was sampled at low frequency to obtain an amplitude-time relation that can be related to the rate of decarburization during the oxygen blow. In contrast, the accelerometer was sampled at high frequency in the second series in order to discern the presence of specific vibrational frequencies that can be related to the process. As a final aspect of the research work, several high frequency simulations were terminated prematurely in an attempt to elucidate the carbon content of the bath at the point in time when the accelerometer can clearly detect the final change in the rate of decarburization.</description><creator>O'Leary, Kevin E.</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</subject><title>The accelerometer as an end-point control sensor for the basic oxygen steelmaking process /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x059c868w.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x920fx93k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qb98mg704</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The present study examines the cycling of elements in the biosphere. The first chapter proposes a theoretical framework for this cycling based on both metal/ligand theory and mass balance studies. Empirical modelling serves as an alternative and complement to mass balance studies in predicting the export of elements from watersheds. Watershed output (export per unit area per unit of time) is predicted using atmospheric deposition rates, an element bonding strength index, the watershed area and a forest classification (deciduous vs coniferous). Finally the last chapter examines, in a speculative fashion, the partitioning of elements between the atmosphere and hydrosphere as a function of element behaviour and discusses the ecological consequences of human activity on this partitioning.</description><creator>Perusse, Martin</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Valley ecology.</subject><subject>Watersheds -- Research.</subject><subject>Metals -- Environmental aspects.</subject><title>Metal cycling in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dr26xz461.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qb98mg704</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xk81jm618</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Measurements of the basic properties of amorphous selenium films relevant to xerographic use were carried out using special apparatus built in the laboratory. The samples for study were prepared in the laboratory and consisted, in each case, of an aluminum plate on which a thin oxide film was formed, followed by the deposition of a 50 micrometer layer of amorphous selenium by evaporation at a substrate temperature near 50$ sp circ$C. The free selenium surface of the sample was then charged to a positive or negative potential from a corona discharge and the acceptance voltage and voltage decay rate in darkness and the residual voltage after illumination were measured. The effect on these quantities of varying the selenium layer thickness, its deposition temperature and deposition rate was determined along with the effect of using selenium containing different concentrations of chlorine. The results point to a dark decay process controlled by injection of carriers from the substrate for undoped selenium and controlled by charge depletion resulting from the emission of carriers from discrete centres in chlorine-doped selenium.</description><creator>Zhang, Qi-Hua</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Engineering, Materials Science.</subject><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Charging properties of amorphous selenium films relevant to xerographic use</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/st74cr52x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xk81jm618</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:st74cr536</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Acoustical reverberation has been shown to degrade the intelligibility and naturalness of speech. In this thesis, we discuss the application of cepstral methods to the enhancement of acoustically reverberant speech. We first study previously described cepstral techniques for removal of simple echoes from signals. Our results show that these techniques are not directly applicable to the enhancement of speech of indefinite extent. We next recast these techniques specifically for speech. We propose new segmentation and windowing strategies, in combination with cepstral averaging, to accurately identify the acoustical impulse response. We then consider inverse filtering based on an estimated acoustical impulse response, and find that finite impulse response filters designed according to the least mean squared error criterion provide satisfactory performance. Finally, we synthesize and test an algorithm for enhancement of reverberant speech. Although significant difficulties remain, we feel that our methods offer a substantial contribution to the solution of the reverberant speech enhancement problem.</description><creator>Bees, Duncan Charles</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Enhancement of acoustically reverberant speech using cepstral methods</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w3763812m.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/st74cr536</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:41687j69c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Precision of determining age in ringed seals (Phoca hispida) was examined by repeated readings of undecalcified cross sections and decalcified stained longitudinal sections of mandibular canines. There appeared to be geographical differences in repeatability although this could not be tested statistically. There was no difference in repeatability between cross and stained sections. The effect of precision on population parameters was examined. Smoothing procedures necessary to construct life tables and to do Leslie matrix calculations obscured any differences in ages between readings. Variance between readings was found to give inconsistent notions of sexual maturity. Imprecision caused little overall difference in growth curves. Without known age animals, accuracy cannot be evaluated directly. High correlation between ages from canines from different sides of the same animal, between dentine and cementum of teeth from the same animal, and between readers examining the same sets of teeth gave an indirect suggestion of accuracy.</description><creator>Albright, Don</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Ringed seal -- Age determination.</subject><title>A critical evaluation of age determination of ringed seals (Phoca hispida Schreber 1775) /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cf95jc60c.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/41687j69c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Renewable Resources</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zw12z659w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this study was to examine the role of the secondary school principal in anglophone Quebec. A sample of eighteen experienced principals were interviewed in-depth about their role expectations, sources of role conflict, and their sense of ambiguity. Role ambiguity appeared to be non-existent in the principalship. Expectations and conflicts were identified with regard to students, teachers, parents, community members, and principal's superiors. The principalship was clearly more a managerial than leadership role. Principals were responders to a series of problems and issues. They orchestrated responses. Instructional leadership was not a part of their role.</description><creator>Achoka, Judith Serah K.</creator><date>1990</date><subject>High school principals -- Québec (Province)</subject><subject>High schools -- Québec (Province) -- Administration</subject><title>The role of the secondary school principal in Quebec English schools /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5712m776x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zw12z659w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kd17cv17q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The aim of the present investigation was to study the structural variability of osteoarthritic human femoral condylar cartilage proteoglycans that can aggregate with hyaluronic acid as compared with site and age matched normal adult cartilage proteoglycans. Using specific antibodies to different parts of the proteoglycan molecule in radioimmunoassays, we were able to detect four proteoglycan populations of different hydrodynamic sizes in normal, as well as in osteoarthritic articular cartilage. These populations were: a large chondroitin 6-sulfate, a smaller chondroitin 4-sulfate, and an even smaller keratan sulfate population together with the hyaluronic acid-binding region. Osteoarthritic articular cartilage contained increased amounts of a foetal-specific epitope, 846, and a decrease in the characteristic adult cartilage proteoglycans. As determined histologically, using a grading system for cartilage degeneration, early in the disease (phase I), the proteoglycans appear to be smaller in size than in normal adult cartilage, while in the later stages of the disease (phase II) they appear to be larger in their hydrodynamic size. The hyaluronic acid-binding region appeared to be functional and proteoglycan aggregation with hyaluronic acid was not altered in osteoarthritis. The data indicate an attempt by the osteoarthritic cartilage at remodeling and repair by making an immature type of proteoglycan.</description><creator>Rizkalla, Geihan</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><title>Immunochemical studies of aggregating proteoglycans in normal and osteoarthritic human articular cartilages</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/73666567b.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kd17cv17q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Surgical Research</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4m90dw674</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:08Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The effect of a single exposure of He-Ne laser on collagen content was studied in vivo using laboratory animals. A standardized 1.5 cm full thickness skin incision was made on the dorsum of 24 Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats were divided into six equal size groups, three groups functioning as controls and three groups functioning as experimental. The experimental animals were irradiated with He-Ne laser four days post-incision for 16 minutes to deliver a total dose of 5.99 J/cm$ sp2$. On days 6, 10 and 14 post-incision, control and experimental animals had the healing wounds excised for analysis of collagen content by assaying spectrophotometrically the hydroxyproline content within the tissue samples. The results of the hydroxyproline content were analyzed using independent-groups t-test and analysis of variance. It was demonstrated that even though the mean values of hydroxyproline within the experimental groups were higher than the respective control groups, no statistical significance could be attributed to this observation.</description><creator>Ross, Ian William</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Radiology.</subject><title>An in vivo study of the effect of an extended single exposure of Helium-Neon (632.8 nm) laser on collagen concentration in healing incisional wounds /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3r074w30c.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4m90dw674</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Dentistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rx913q50r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:08Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The digenean parasite, Plagiorchis elegans can establish  infections in the incompatible snail, Biomphalaria glabrata , a vector of human  schistosomiasis. Although embryonic development is arrested at the sporocyst stage,  infection with a single parasite egg reduced reproductive success of this  incompatible host to 64%. Heavier doses reduced this to 45%. Biomphalaria glabrata  quickly acquired large numbers of parasites by ad libitum browsing on  egg-contaminated substrates. Age of the host at exposure affected subsequent  reproductive success and survival. Snails exposed as young (3mm), produced 54% fewer  eggs, and suffered relatively high mortality. Adults (9mm) were affected only  marginally. Plagiorchis elegans shares its ability to establish truncated infections  in incompatible hosts with at least one other plagiorchiid. Haematoloechus  medioplexus castrated the snail Stagnicola elodes, but not B. glabrata. Findings are  discussed in the context of using incompatible digenean parasites as agents in the  biological control of snails and snail-borne diseases, and ecological consequences  of these infections.</description><creator>Platero, Idalia Ada</creator><contributor>Rau, M.

In the  absence of the costimulatory signals or when the TCR is presented with an altered  peptide ligand (APL), TCR- or APL-induced anergy respectively develops. These two  anergic phenotypes were induced and compared following appropriate restimulation  (anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 mAb or antigenic peptide) using the same T cell line, an HIV-1  gp120-specific CD4+ human T cell clone (Een 217). Our results indicate that distinct  mechanisms of anergy exist and are able to operate at different levels in the TCR  signaling pathways since only the TCR-anergized T cells restimulated with the  antigenic peptide could restore partial T cell signaling. Furthermore, the regulation of the Zap-70 protein tyrosine  kinase was also studied during productive TCR stimulation. We demonstrate, using a  Zap-70 Y69F mutant, that the phosphorylation of tyrosine 69 present in the SH2  domain negatively regulates Zap-70 by possibly disrupting the association between  the TCR and Zap-70, a mechanism also present in other molecules of the TCR signaling  pathway.</description><creator>Petrou, Alexandra</creator><contributor>Couture, Clement (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><title>Differential regulation of zap-70 in anergized and productively stimulated human T cells</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tt44pn501.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fx719m993</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2z10wq793</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:10:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Objectives. To determine the relationship between objective  stress, subjective reaction, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and  cortisol in pregnant women exposed to a natural disaster. Methods. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) was used to  measure PTSD symptoms in 193 subjects, and a Storm Questionnaire to assess objective  and subjective stress. Seven salivary cortisol samples were collected from each  subject; six were obtained between waking and bedtime on the first day, and then a  seventh upon waking on the second day. Results. Both objective stress and subjective reactions to the  storm negatively predict cortisol, but size and significance of the effects vary  according to trimesters of stress exposure. Across the four pregnancy groups, up to  42% of the variance in cortisol could be explained by objective stress and  subjective reactions. Conclusion. More severe PTSD symptoms are associated with lower  cortisol levels, and pregnancy dampens a woman's physiological response to  stress.</description><creator>Pan, Yi Irene</creator><contributor>Ciampi, Antonio (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>King, Suzanne (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Psychology, Physiological.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Obstetrics and Gynecology.</subject><title>The impact of the 1998 Quebec ice storm on pregnant women's hormonal reactions /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d791sg92j.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2z10wq793</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):24600</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
