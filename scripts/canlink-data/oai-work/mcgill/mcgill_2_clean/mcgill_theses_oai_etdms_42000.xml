While consumer display applications are based on defect-free homogeneous liquid crystals, the performance of biosensors devices and the characterization of structural material precursors is based on the presence of defects, textures, and heterogeneities. This thesis uses theory, modeling, and simulation to formulate the computational optical science of textured liquid crystals, and its applications in biosensors and material characterization methods. The computational optical science of textured liquid crystals is established by a comprehensive study of light propagation through cross-polars in thin liquid crystal films containing defects of significant complexity. Optical matrix methods widely used in display applications, including the aggregate model and the well-known Berreman method are quantitatively compared with the direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the Maxwell equations for anisotropic liquid crystal media. Biosensors based on liquid crystal vision offer an affordable, fast, transportable means to detect viruses and proteins, through the disruption of the liquid crystal orientation upon protein surface adsorption. This thesis presents simulations of the texture formation process relevant to the LC biosensors based on the nematodynamic model and the matrix and DNS optical methods and identifies the optical factors that lead to optimal performance. Rheooptics is an experimental tool used to better characterize the flow properties of liquid crystal polymer solutions. The rheooptics of Poly-gamma-Benzyl-L-Glutamate (PBLG) solutions under shear start-up flow between parallel plates was computed using the Berreman method and the FDTD method. The ubiquitous banded textures were reproduced using the Leslie-Ericksen equation for flowing liquid crystals. The optical signal of each band revealed the presence of characteristic double peak structures which correlated with the underlying defect texture of the flowing polymer solutions. Carbonaceous mesophases are precursors materials used in the manufacturing of high performance carbon fiber composites. Reflection polarized optical microscopy (RPOM) is used to characterize the experimentally observed defects and heterogeneities in these materials.</description><creator>Hwang, Dae Kun, 1972-</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Computational optical science of textured liquid crystals for biosensors, rheooptics, and carbon composites</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Dae Kun Hwang, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6q182q44m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qf85ng41j</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:c534fs90r</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The object of this thesis is to develop a new extension of Image Correlation Spectroscopy (ICS) that can measure velocity vectors for flowing protein populations in living cells. This new technique, called Spatio-Temporal Image Correlation Spectroscopy (STICS), allows measurement of both diffusion coefficients and velocity vectors (magnitude and direction) from fluorescence microscopy image time series of fluorescently labeled cellular proteins via monitoring of the time evolution of the full space-time correlation function of the intensity fluctuations. By using filtering in Fourier space to remove frequencies associated with immobile or slow components, it is possible to measure the protein transport even in the presence of a large fraction of immobile species that are static in the image series. The STICS method can generate complete transport maps of proteins within sub-regions of the basal membrane even if the protein concentration is too high to perform single particle tracking measurements, and it can be applied to any type of fluorescence microscopy image time series. This thesis presents the background theory, computer simulations, and analysis of measurements on fluorescent microspheres and fixed cell samples to demonstrate proof of principle, capabilities, and limitations of the method. Visible fluorescent proteins (VFPs) were used to label a variety of the proteins involved in cell-to-extra-cellular-matrix adhesions, including focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, alpha-actinin, alpha5-integrin, talin, vinculin and actin. Various fusion protein pairs were transfected in living cells and imaged using both laser scanning microscopy and total internal reflection microscopes. Using STICS analysis, co-transport maps of proteins were generated within protruding sub-regions of the basal membrane. The new space time image correlation method can probe the mechanistic details of the hypothesized molecular clutch that regulates the extra cellular matrix/cytoskeletal interactions during migration. The technique was also applied to mapping fluid flow in migrating keratocytes in order to elucidate the role that fluid flow plays in migrating cells.</description><creator>Hébert, Benedict.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Biophysics, General.</subject><title>Spatio-temporal image correlation spectroscopy : development and implementation in living cells</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Benedict Hébert, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/47429f643.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fs90r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hx11xj997</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>X-ray microdiffraction is a powerful technique to study the microstructure of materials. In this thesis we built two x-ray micro diffraction setups and demonstrated their capabilities by two case studies. In our microfocusing setup, synchrotron x-rays were focused to a micron-size spot using a Fresnel zone plate. To scan the sample, we built a 3-axis translation stage with 30 nm step size over 25 mm travel range. Our x-ray diffraction imaging (topography) setup consisted of a monochromator, a channel-cut analyzer to define the diffraction angle, and a CCD camera with 0.645 mum pixels size to record the images. In our first project, we studied the microstructure of 90° ferroelectric domains and domain walls in barium titanate (BaTiO3). We discovered a ~ 1 mum surface-like layer below the surface where domain walls angle, strain, and domains orientation deviate from the bulk values. These can be explained in terms of total energy minimization and domain-domain interaction. In our second project, we used x-ray topography to measure lattice deformations in the free and bent states of a silicon micro-cantilever used in scanning probe microscopy. We found that the cantilever was twisted by 8 mdeg with respect to the base and there were small strains in the cantilever and joint area. In the bent state, we measured 0.3 m average radius of anticlastic curvature and a maximum of 2 x 10-5 strain at the edges of the cantilever. We discuss possible causes of the twist and the non-zero strains. Our setups and the tools we developed can be used to study the microstructure of other similar systems, as well.</description><creator>Hassani, Khosrow.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Physics, Condensed Matter.</subject><title>X-ray microdiffraction techniques to study the microstructure of materials</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Khosrow Hassani, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/05741w94f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hx11xj997</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qf85ng42t</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Industrial experience has revealed that when used to treat multi-component metal chloride waste liquors, existing fluidized bed acid regeneration facilities are not as efficient as when employed for the pyrohydrolysis of conventional iron chloride solutions (i.e. waste pickle liquor). As a result, experimental studies and thermochemical modelling were performed to characterize the transformation of a saturated Al-Fe-Mg-Cl solution at 105°C, after it is injected into a reactor at 850°C. Efforts were geared toward defining the sequence of reactions that take place as the liquor gradually transforms into oxides.C, after it is injected into a reactor at 850°C. Efforts were geared toward defining the sequence of reactions that take place as the liquor gradually transforms into oxides.C, after it is injected into a reactor at 850°C. Efforts were geared toward defining the sequence of reactions that take place as the liquor gradually transforms into oxides.C, after it is injected into a reactor at 850°C. Efforts were geared toward defining the sequence of reactions that take place as the liquor gradually transforms into oxides. Upon completing a comprehensive literature review, testwork was initially performed with a simplified experimental set-up to study the physical behaviour of the chloride solution as it is exposed to a static bed of oxides at 850°C, and ultimately identify the various phases of the transformation process. Subsequently, controlled evaporative crystallization experiments were conducted under pseudo-equilibrium conditions to define the McClx·yH 2O precipitation path that takes place during the H2O evaporation phase and to determine whether the chlorides precipitate independently or as complex compounds. Further experiments were performed in a fully instrumented tube furnace to elaborate on the nature of the reactions (dehydration and/or pyrohydrolysis) that take place after all of the water in the starting solution has evaporated (i.e. T=300°C+). In an effort to assist with the interpretation of the experimental results, thermochemical modelling was performed to predict the equilibrium phase assemblages that could occur during the transformation of the saturated Al-Fe-Mg-Cl solution, at reaction temperatures of 200°C+. The research study at hand has shown that when the saturated Al-Fe-Mg-Cl solution at 105°C is exposed to fluidized bed pyrohydrolyzer operating conditions at 850°C, the following sequence of events take place: (1) rapid solvent H2O evaporation (i.e. vigorous boiling) and onset of solid metal chloride precipitation. (2) slurry densification due to a gradual increase in crystal content (i.e. AlCl·6H2O, FeCl2 ·xH2O, and MgCl2·xH2O, where x = 2 or 4). (3) hydrated crystal drying and onset of pyrohydrolysis (i.e. thermal decomposition of McClx·yH2O). The same holds true for the high temperature hydrolysis of typical waste pickle liquors (i.e. primarily FeCl2 solution). The crystallization studies revealed that when the Al-Fe-Mg-Cl solution is allowed to gradually evaporate at 105°C,.AlCl3·6H 2O precipitates when 15% of the solvent water evolves from the liquor, followed by FeCl2·xH2O and MgCl2·xH 2O (where x = 2 or 4) at 26 and 41% evaporation, respectively. Ferric chloride remains in solution even after 54% of the water has been driven from the liquor. The latter result suggests that higher ferric concentrations in the reactor feed are more than likely to favour an increase in the quantity of liquor entrainment by the fluidizing gases and therefore lead to lower process efficiencies. Dedicated pyrohydrolysis experiments, with a simulated reactor atmosphere (gaseous, not dynamic), have shown that excluding kinetic effects, the transformation of the Al-Fe-Mg-Cl solution occurs primarily over the 300 to 600°C temperature range. Thermochemical modelling revealed that with the exception of AlCl 3·6H2O hydrolysis, the majority of the reactions taking place as the saturated Al-Fe-Mg-Cl liquor is introduced into and eventually reaches 850°C are governed by either reaction kinetics or diffusion. Furthermore, the resulting phase assemblage at any given temperature was predicted to vary significantly with oxygen potential. A liquid chloride phase (including molten salt), other than the feed liquor, was not predicted to form at any temperature (i.e. 200°C or above) under the range of oxidizing or reducing conditions considered. The findings of this research were quite useful in identifying the means for improving the performance of a commercial fluidized bed pyrohydrolyzer for a spent chloride liquor containing the said species.</description><creator>Coscia, Carlo.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</subject><title>Transformation of an aluminium-iron-magnesium- chloride solution during pyrohydrolysis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Carlo Coscia, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1c18dk97p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qf85ng42t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5q47rt118</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a powerful strategy to eliminate a variety of tumor and alloreactive T cells. While the cytotoxic effect of the novel rhodamine-derived TH9402 photosensitizer has been attributed to the generation of radical oxygen species, the cell death pathways involved have not been extensively investigated. In this study, we evaluated the ability of PDT to induce apoptosis and necrosis in EL4 cells, and assessed its underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that the dominant mode of cell death after PDT was influenced by the conditions of treatment. PDT using TH9402 triggers a caspase-dependent intrinsic apoptotic pathway. However, the incapacity of caspase inhibition to block the induction of apoptosis and to limit cell death indicates that apoptosis induced by PDT also involves a caspase-independent pathway. The observation that the TH9402 photosensitizer mediates cytotoxicity through activation of a number of death pathways suggests that it could effectively limit the capacity of tumor cells to become resistant to TH9402. Secondly, PDT using TH9402 induces a time- and dose-dependent decrease in target cell viability resulting in high levels of elimination of multiple myeloma cells. In an attempt to evaluate the clinical relevance of these findings and simulate minimal residual disease in an apheresis product, the combination of RPMI-8226 myeloma cells admixed with human apheresis cells from healthy donors was PDT treated. Again high levels of elimination of myeloma cells were observed while sparing normal cells. This important cytotoxic activity was observed in conditions which preserve more that 50% of hematopoietic progenitor cells. These results strongly suggest that TH9402 PDT represents an appealing strategy in ex vivo purging of autologous stem cell transplants in patients with multiple myeloma. Finally, we have found that immunization with PDT-treated whole tumor cells was able to delay tumor cell growth. This finding encouraged us to investigate whether a DC-based PDT vaccine could protect from tumor cell progression. In this study, purified DCs were generated from murine bone marrow. We also identified a cytokine combination capable of promoting DC activation. Under these conditions, PDT-treated tumor cells did not increase IL-12 production by DCs, but they provoked partial maturation of DCs. Once these activated DCs were loaded with whole tumor cells treated by PDT, a tumor protection effect was observed in two different murine models in vivo. Such a vaccine may be particularly useful when tumor cells do not represent a pure cell population and are rather dispersed among normal cells. The present studies therefore uncovered unique apoptotic pathways of TH9402 PDT, and identified two appealing approaches to take advantage clinically of those peculiar photochemical properties in an attempt to improve the survival of patients with cancer.</description><creator>Dai, Qin Yong, 1967-</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><title>TH9402 mediated photodynamic therapy : implications for ex vivo purging and tumor vaccination</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Qin Yong Dai, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v979v680x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5q47rt118</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z890rz80z</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Colletotrichum coccodes strain DAOM 183088 is considered a potential bioherbicide for velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti), a devastating weed in North American corn and soybeans. Risk assessment studies have created a demand for an accurate and robust method to monitor this strain, and to distinguish it from indigenous background population of microorganisms present in the field. Safe biological control management of velvetleaf also requires comprehensive understanding of the pathogenicity determinants employed by this host-specific fungus to establish infection on velvetleaf, an aspect central to a safe biocontrol strategy task. In this study, molecular markers were designed that allow strain specific identification of the bioherbicide strain of C. coccodes and its identification within complex plant and soil matrices. An assay was developed to quantify C. coccodes from deliberate release field soil samples, in which biases caused by soil-originating PCR inhibitors were monitored on a sample per sample basis. The developed external control assay allowed for the estimation of target C. coccodes DNA quantities with normalization for the presence of PCR inhibitory compounds. Kinetic growth curves of disease development were performed for C. coccodes wild-type and T20-a (genetically engineered for hypervirulence with the NEP1 (necrosis and ethylene inducing peptide) gene) strains on velvetleaf leaves over a period of 14 days after C. coccodes infection. The wild-type strain was more efficient at infecting velvetleaf than the transgenic T-20a strain, while expression of NEP1 could not be detected suggesting that the introduced gene may not be transcriptionally active in the transformed strain, a result in conflict with previous observations. Velvetleaf and C. coccodes genes specifically upregulated at 12 and 24 h after fungal infection were cloned and differentially screened by microarrays. The resulting EST collection was sequenced and assigned to putative functions. Early gene up-regulation was confirmed by QRT-PCR analysis for type 3 metal lothionein, EREB, WRKY, and bZIP transcription factors, reticuline oxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, and ACC oxidase gene candidates. In addition, type 2, type 3 metallothionein, and bZIP gene expression profiles were investigated over a period of 14 days after C. coccodes infection, and the results indicated that C. coccodes altered the expression of all three gene analyzed.</description><creator>Dauch, Amélie L.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Colletotrichum coccodes.</subject><subject>Indian mallow -- Biological control.</subject><title>Velvetleaf-Colletotrichum coccodes pathosystem : molecular monitoring of the pathogen and gene expression analysis during plant pathogen interaction</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Amélie L.

These mechanical properties of cartilage result from the physiological activities of chondrocytes, the phenotypically unique cells that produce and maintain the cartilage matrix. The behaviour of these cells is controlled by extracellular milieu components including: matrix molecules, growth factors, calcium and phosphorus. The interaction of these signals maintains the homeostatic balance between anabolism and catabolism in healthy articular cartilage. Unimpeded imbalances between these processes result in disease states such as Osteoarthritis. In this thesis work the specific and combined effects of PTHrP, FGF, calcium and phosphate signalling on cartilage metabolism were studied. PTHrP was shown to localize to the cell nucleus and under conditions of stress prevented cells from progressing in the cell cycle by inhibiting ribosome biogenesis. Furthermore, it was shown that the expression of the phosphate transporter GLVR-1 was inhibited by the presence of PTHrP in a high stress growth environment. Inhibiting the expression of this receptor effectively prevented intracellular accumulation of phosphate and as a result inhibited chondrocyte differentiation processes. Observation of PTHrP -/-/FGFR3-/- double knockout mice showed a dominant role for PTHrP in promoting chondrocyte proliferation, preventing apoptosis and inhibiting terminal differentiation. In contrast, FGFR3 promoted terminal differentiation and apoptosis in the absence of PTHrP. Additionally, studies of primary chondrocyte cultures generated from FGFR3-/- and FGFR3+/+ mice demonstrated impaired mitogenic response and decreased production of collagen II and proteoglycan in response to FGF18 stimulation in the presence of FGFR3, thus, identifying FGF18 as a selective ligand for FGFR3 in chondrogenic cells. The various studies presented in this thesis show that signals from growth factors, the extracellular matrix and mineral ion components of the extracellular milieu interact to regulate the process of chondrogenesis and identify PTHrP and FGFR3 as potential molecular targets for the bioengineering of cartilage tissue.</description><creator>Davidson, David, 1963-</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>Interactive signalling by growth factors and extracellular matrix molecules in cartilage development and metabolism</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© David Davidson, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kh04dt64r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cj82kc607</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:dr26z226b</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Indian hobbyism, or Indianism, is an expression of a typically European fascination with Native American peoples which involves crafting "museum-quality replicas" of clothing and artifacts as well as reenactment of slices of Native American nineteenth-century life by non-Native practitioners in an effort to produce knowledge and meaningful experience through experimentation. Drawing on fieldwork data collected in 2003 and 2004 among play communities of Indian hobbyists in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, and the Czech Republic, I formulate an understanding of the social, performative, and mimetic dynamics of this phenomenon by conceiving of Indianist practices as forms of play that constantly shift between different play frames. In terms of knowledge production, I argue that the Indian hobby provides a space in which different (epistemological) traditions meet, as Indian hobbyists draw on, and enact, a hybrid reservoir of indigenous and European knowledge systems and art forms. Especially interesting is the relationship between Indianism and the dynamics of museal display in the West, both historically and contemporaneously. In general, I found that two different approaches to the right way of representing may be distinguished in Indianist methodological practice: a "Renaissance" and a "Translational" mode. Because of its striking mimetic aspects, Indianism raises questions of identity play and cultural appropriation. An important element of the hobbyist quest for knowledge and experience consists in investing the self in an "other" in ways that elicit criticism from outsiders, including anthropologists. Indian hobbyism is a controversial example of "playing at" cultures that (by all conventional standards) belong elsewhere and to someone else, providing interesting insights for debates on identity politics and the construction of "race"---also among Indianists themselves. Rather than longing to embody someone else's identity, however, Indianists, almost in spite of themselves, enact a social world that is filled with action and life in their European present. Indianist practice and desire for authenticity revolve around craftsmanship and reenactment, resulting in skillful replicas, in the here and now.</description><creator>Kalshoven, Petra Tjitske.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Indian craft -- Europe.</subject><subject>Indianists -- Europe.</subject><subject>Indians of North America -- Foreign public opinion, European.</subject><subject>Indians of North America -- Clothing -- Societies, etc.</subject><title>Plays on &amp;quot;the Indian&amp;quot; : representation of knowledge and authenticity in Indianist mimetic practice</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Petra Tjitske Kalshoven, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n870zv70m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dr26z226b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anthropology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8k71nn307</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Karl Barth (1886-1968) was an ardent defender of the filioque, the doctrine which states that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son. Generally, scholarly analysis is restricted to Barth's defence of the filioque in the first half volume of the Church Dogmatics. However, this thesis proceeds on the assumption that a fuller understanding of the filioque in Barth must take into account the genesis and development of the doctrine in his earlier thought. A latent dialectical christocentric pneumatology in the second edition of Romans (1921) provides the material theological support for the doctrine, which subsequently appears in a formal discussion of the filioque in the Gottingen Dogmatics (1924). There Barth speaks of the filioque as a theological analogy of the structure of his developing doctrine of the threefold Word of God. As preaching proceeds from revelation and Scripture, so too the Spirit is to be understood as proceeding from the Father and the Son. Barth continues to defend and apply the filioque in the Church Dogmatics, though the original connection to the threefold form of the Word of God recedes into the background. Instead, the filioque functions systematically both as a theological guarantee of the unity of the work of the Son and the Spirit and as the eternal ground of fellowship between God and humanity. Barth's most mature view of the filioque is construed in dialectical terms whereby the Spirit is understood to be eternally active in uniting and differentiating the Father and the Son. Furthermore, Barth is atypical in the Western filioquist tradition because he refuses to speak of the filioque in terms of a "double procession"; rather, he views the Spirit as proceeding from the common being-of-the-Father-and-the-Son. Barth's stance on the filioque does not result in a form of pneumatological subordinationism, as critics often maintain. Rather, his adoption of the filioque reflects a tendency toward a superordination of the Spirit over Father and Son in a structurally similar way to Hegel's pneumatology. The thesis concludes by pointing to a tension in Barth's thought which in practice tends toward a conflation of economic and immanent Trinity as he reads back into God the problem and confrontation he perceives to exist between God and humanity.</description><creator>Guretzki, David Glenn.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Holy Spirit -- Procession.</subject><subject>Barth, Karl, 1886-1968.

Merr.] seeds contain isoflavones that have positive impacts on human health. Field and greenhouse experiments were conducted in Quebec Canada to determine the effects of management and environmental factors [seeding date (late May and mid June), row spacing (20-, 40- and 60-cm), weeds (presence or absence), irrigation levels (low, moderate, and high) and genotypes (Proteina, Orford, and Golden)] and of foliar applications of elicitor compounds (i.e., LCOs, chitosan, and actinomycetes spores), on the isoflavone concentrations of mature soybean seeds, and other important seed characteristics. Our results indicated that environmental and agronomical factors have a great impact on soybean seed isoflavone concentrations of early maturity soybean cultivars. Year, seeding date, and weeds affected total and individual isoflavone concentrations, row spacing had no effect. Total isoflavone concentration was greater in 2003 than 2004. Seeding in mid June increased isoflavone concentration by 38%, compared to seeding in May. The presence of weeds increased total isoflavone concentrations by 9%. Isoflavone concentrations were significantly affected by cultivars and irrigation levels. In both of two growing seasons, Proteina had significantly greater isoflavone concentrations compared to Orford. Irrigation effects on isoflavone concentrations differed between years and cultivars. However, most responses were observed with the lower of the two irrigation levels, which increased isoflavone concentrations by as much as 60% compared to a non-irrigated control. Our results suggest that under greenhouse conditions most biotic elicitors tested increased the concentration of individual and total isoflavones in soybean seeds when compared to untreated control plants. LCOs proved to be the most effective in studies contrasting various elicitors. Response of field-grown plants was more variable than that of greenhouse-grown plants.</description><creator>Al-Tawaha, Abdel Rahman.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Isoflavones.</subject><subject>Soybean.</subject><title>Factors affecting isoflavone concentration in soybean (Glycine max L.)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Abdel Rahman Al-Tawaha, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zs25xd78g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z903422j</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Plant Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9g54xn91c</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A ballot theorem is a theorem that yields information about the conditional probability that a random walk stays above its mean, given its value St after some specified amount of time t. In the first part of this thesis, ballot theorems are proved for all walks whose steps consist of independent, identically distributed random variables that are in the range of attraction of the normal distribution. With a mild assumption on the moments of the steps, the results are strengthened; the latter results are shown to be within a constant factor of optimal when the value of the random walk at time t is of order t . Farther results are proved for random walks whose value after time t is of order O(t). In the second part of the thesis, two questions about the heights of random trees are studied. The random trees that are studied are of interest from both a purely probabilistic, and an algorithmic perspective. It turns out that in two seemingly very distinct settings, the height of a random tree turns out to be closely linked to the behavior of a random walk, in particular to the probability that a random walk stays above its mean. The tools developed in the first part of the thesis, together with additional results, are then used to derive information about the moments of the height of these random trees. We also demonstrate that this information can be used to bound the moments of the minima of certain branching random walks.</description><creator>Addario-Berry, Dana.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Mathematics.</subject><title>Ballot theorems and the heights of trees</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Dana Addario-Berry, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k3569841k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9g54xn91c</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:r781wm479</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis investigates the syntax-discourse interface in adult, end state second language (L2) acquisition. Specifically, it examines topic constructions in Spanish and English, namely Clitic Left Dislocation (CLLD) and Contrastive Left Dislocation (CLD), which exhibit both syntactic and discourse level properties. In both cases, topics occur at the left periphery of clauses and reintroduce a subset of a known set previously mentioned in discourse. Sensitivity to specificity is available in Spanish but not in English. The interpretation of the topicalized element as either generic or specific depends on the presence or absence of the clitic. Data from a bidirectional study are reported in order to investigate the issue of L1 transfer as well as the question of whether acquiring a new property is easier than losing a property. Three current theories of acquisition are examined, namely, the Full Transfer/Full Access model (FT/FA), Failed Functional Features Hypothesis/Representational Deficit Hypothesis (FFFH/RDH), and Optionality theory. The theories are considered with respect to their predictions about L2 ultimate attainment and the syntax-discourse interface. Participants were 15 end state speakers of L2 Spanish/L1 English and 15 end state speakers of L2 English/L1 Spanish were tested. Three tasks were administered for each study (Sentence Completion Task, oral Sentence Selection Task, and oral Acceptability Task) targeting topic constructions and associated interpretive properties in the respective target languages. Results for the L2 Spanish study indicate that while the syntactic properties of CLLD were acquired, the interpretive properties of specificity were fossilized (i.e. clitic was overgeneralized). Results for the L2 English study also showed that the syntactic properties were acquired but the specificity distinction of the L1 was transferred into the L2. Results demonstrate that problems with specificity occur in both directions as predicted by the theory of Optionality. In both cases, the optionality found at the interpretive level was L1-based. Namely, non-target L1 forms co-existed with the L2 forms.</description><creator>Valenzuela, Elena.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Second language acquisition.</subject><subject>English language -- Topic and comment.</subject><subject>Language transfer (Language learning)</subject><subject>Spanish language -- Topic and comment.</subject><title>L2 ultimate attainment and the syntax-discourse interface : the acquisition of topic constructions in non-native Spanish and English</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Elena Valenzuela, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ws859k818.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r781wm479</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Linguistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6969z510s</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study explores three syntactic issues in the Romanian DP: the cliticization of the definite article, the syntactic position of postnominal APs, and the syntactic properties and position of cel. First, I show that the affixation of the definite article can be derived by syntactic head movement of the host element to D0. The distributional asymmetries among adjectives with respect to the definite article are accounted for by hypothesizing that they occur in two structurally distinct positions. Adjectives that surface prenominally are heads in the extended nominal projection; while adjectives that surface postnominally are maximal projections. I show that prenominal adjectives (a) block head-movement of the noun to D 0, (b) bypass the same elements as the noun, and (c) are blocked by the same element as the noun. In chapter 3, I claim that APs surfacing between the noun and its complement are generated to the left of N; and APs that follow the complement of the noun are generated to the right. The postnominal surface position of the former APs is derived by leftward noun head-movement as opposed to remnant phrasal-movement. The evidence hinges on the relative scope among APs. I show that the symmetric approach, supported here, generates all and only attested word-order---scope pairings; while antisymmetry generates additional, unattested pairs. Finally, I account for the asymmetric distribution of prenominal versus postnominal cel relative to the definite suffix. In previous literature, cel was equated with D0. Conversely, I claim that cel heads a modifier phrase, say celP. I show that prenominal celP has the same syntactic distribution and properties as demonstratives, including the ability to license a covert definite D0; while postnominal celP, like all postnominal modifiers, lacks this property. This study provides a guide to the structure and movements in the Romanian DP, from its lower domain, the base position of N, up to the DP domain. Throughout, this work, I argue that several empirical generalizations on syntactic distribution are best accounted for by head-movement and the Head Movement Constraint. The evidence I produce comes from morpho-syntax (e.g. cliticization), semantics (e.g. scope interpretation) and plain linear word-order.</description><creator>Ungureanu, Mona-Luiza.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Romanian language -- Article.</subject><subject>Romanian language -- Syntax.</subject><title>DP-internal structure and movement in Romanian</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Mona-Luiza Ungureanu, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fq978020n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6969z510s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Linguistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ms35td38r</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Temporal changes in the environmental conditions upon which life depend are ubiquitous in nature, acting at every level of organisation from cells to ecosystems. Although the actions themselves are often poorly understood, they strongly depend on the temporal and hierarchical (organisational) scales at which they are measured; ecosystems are relatively stable through time while their species composition may undergo vast changes. Likewise any hierarchical level may be relatively stable in the short-term, but undergo vast long-term changes. This thesis aims to better understand the importance of these scales for mediating the impact of environmental variability on ecological systems. The approach used herein employs both mathematical models and empirical data which represent food webs responding to environmental variability at different hierarchical scales. Within each of these representative food webs, the influence of environmental variability on the stability of the food web is determined using an approach which accounts for the effects of temporal scale. This thesis demonstrates that the stability of simple model food webs (high hierarchical scale) is tightly linked to environmental variability and the temporal scales at which these changes occur dictate which species in the model are most affected. At lower scales of organisation, empirical data indicate that environmental variability generally has a lesser impact on stability and that only certain temporal scales are responsible for this trend. At these temporal scales some species respond differently to environmental variability, negative changes in one species (or group) are offset by positive changes in another - a process known as compensation. These results highlight the importance of both temporal and hierarchical scale in mediating the response of food webs to environmental variability. Ultimately, they will serve to better understand how models and experiments should scale-up from low to high hierarchical and temporal scales.</description><creator>Vasseur, David Alan.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Food chains (Ecology) -- Constance, Lake.</subject><subject>Phytoplankton -- Constance, Lake.</subject><title>Temporal and hierarchical scales mediate environmental and ecological variability in food webs</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© David Alan Vasseur, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x633f5477.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ms35td38r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1r66j530h</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The thesis opens with an account of the origins of the modern problem of the demarcation of the logical constants in Alfred Tarski's 1936 lecture "On the Concept of Logical Consequence". Focus then shifts to the logical notions, to free the investigation from parochialism. John Etchemendy's recent challenge to the demarcation project is discussed and rejected. The thesis then surveys various methodological issues, conceptions of the aims and purposes of logic, and needed technical concepts. This provides the requisite tools to carry out the evaluation of existing demarcation proposals. Three groups of demarcation proposals are elaborated and evaluated. First are model-theoretic proposals, which attempt to define the logical notions as those whose extensions are held fixed under various classes of morphisms on the domains on models for logic. Next are the proof-theoretic proposals which attempt to define the logical notions as those whose meanings can be fixed by inference rules. Last, various other proposals which do not fall into any general grouping are discussed. In all cases, the proposed demarcations are rejected, either due to internal technical considerations, or because the demarcation offered will not suffice to meet the aims and purposes of logic. Finally, the thesis turns to arguments that there could not be a unique demarcation of the logical notions which serves all of the central purposes of logic. Further, it is argued that disputes over the nature of logic are subject to a particular intractability, as a dispute over logic is, at least in part, a dispute over the norms under which disputes are to be carried out; thus we have strong reason to doubt that there could be a demarcation that would resolve the debates. I conclude that logic is, at base, an irreducibly interest-relative and pragmatic affair.</description><creator>Van den Broek, Brian.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Logic.</subject><title>What is constant in logic?</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Brian Van den Broek, 2005</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dv13zz33t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1r66j530h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Philosophy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:t722hf070</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Rho GTPases are members of the Ras superfamily of small monomeric GTP binding proteins that regulate multiple cellular processes affecting both cell proliferation and cytoskeletal dynamics. They are positively and negatively regulated by the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPS), respectively. In principle, extracellular signals such as growth factors and other agents bind to plasma membrane receptors and modulate Rho GTPase function through intracellular mechanisms that affect GEF or GAP activities. There is now compelling evidence that both receptors and cytoplasmic proteins implicated in Rho GTPase signaling are modulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. CdGAP (Cdc42 GTPase- activating protein) is a negative regulator of Rac1 and Cdc42 and the netrin-1 receptor DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) is an upstream activator of these GTPases during axon guidance. To date, very little is known about the biochemical regulation of these two proteins. Given that CdGAP protein migrates higher than its expected molecular weight and contains a number of consensus phosphorylation sites for different kinases, and that the DCC ortholog in C. elegans UNC-40 is tyrosine phosphorylated, it is likely that both proteins are regulated through mechanisms involving phosphorylation. In the first part of this thesis, we have demonstrated that CdGAP phosphorylation in vivo is stimulated by external cues that activate the Ras-MEK-ERK pathway. We also found that CdGAP is phosphorylated in vivo on serine, threonine but not tyrosine residues. Phosphorylation of Thr776 by ERK and that this phosphorylation is important in regulating CdGAP's activity towards Rac1. In the second part, we found that the human ortholog of CdGAP is also active both in vitro and in vivo on Cdc42 and Rac1 but not RhoA. Furthermore, we found that the human protein is also highly phosphorylated in vivo on serine and threonine residues but not tyrosine. In the last part, we have combined classical biochemical approaches and the dissection of rat primary commissural neurons and found that DCC is phosphorylated in vivo upon netrin-1 stimulation on serine, threonine and tyrosine residues. We have also found that the phosphorylation and function of DCC in axon outgrowth and guidance is mainly regulated by the Src family tyrosine kinases.</description><creator>Tcherkezian, Joseph.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Phosphoregulation of CdGAP and DCC, proteins involved in actin dynamics</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Joseph Tcherkezian, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d504rq51x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t722hf070</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6q182q45w</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis presents a statistical learning framework for inferring geometric structures from images. Specifically, the proposed framework computes dense range maps of location sin the environment using only intensity images and very limited amount of range data as an input. This is achieved by integrating and analyzing the statistical relationships between the visual data and the available depth on terms of small patches. The scientific issue is to represent this correlation such that it can be used to recover range data where missing. Markov Random Fields are used as a model to capture the local statistics of the intensity and range. Experiments on real-world data are conducted under different configurations to demonstrate the feasibility of the method. In particular, our application is in mobile robotics, where inferring the 3D layout of indoor environments is a critical problem for achieving exploration and navigation tasks. The modeling of a large-scale environment involves the acquisition of a huge amount of range data to extract the geometry of the scene, and is often performed using sophisticated but costly hardware solutions. This task is physically demanding and time consuming for many real systems. By using the proposed framework, it is demonstrated that we can learn the geometric characteristics of the environment from the incomplete sensory data to build a 3D model of it. The contributions of this thesis are mainly three: First, it demonstrates the viability of the use of very limited range data together with intensity to recover complete dense range maps. Second, it presents a complete framework for building a 3D model of an indoor environment using a mobile robot. And third, it analyses and outlines the advantages and limitations encountered when dealing with large indoor environments. An additional contribution is the use of the method we propose for range estimation to an alternative problem: color correction and augmentation with the specific application to underwater images.</description><creator>Torres Méndez, Luz Abril.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Engineering, Robotics.</subject><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Statistics of visual and partial range data for mobile robot environment modeling : Luz Abril Torres Méndez.</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Luz Abril Torres Méndez, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b5644w87s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6q182q45w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6682x799g</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis examines constructions known as resultative constructions. In addition to the well-known adjectival resultative construction in English, I investigate the resultative V-V compound, found in Japanese, and the resultative serial verb construction, found in Edo. I propose a new classification of these constructions, which focuses on the argument structure of the construction. In Japanese resultative V-V compounds, the argument structure of a compound reflects the argument structure of the second verb only, while in Edo, the argument structure of the construction reflects the argument structure of both verbs involved. With this criterion, English resultative constructions are divided into two classes---a resultative construction containing an intransitive verb is classified with Japanese resultative V-V compounds, and a resultative construction containing an object-selecting verb is classified with Edo resultative serial verb constructions. Based on the classification provided here, I investigate two types of syntactic operations which license the concatenation of the predicates in resultative constructions. I argue that English intransitive resultative constructions and Japanese resultative V-V compounds are formed by adjoining one of the predicates on the other. The adjunction structure is then interpreted as conjunction called event identification. In contrast, English transitive resultative constructions and Edo resultative serial verb constructions are licensed by treating one of the predicates as a causative predicate. I argue that one of the predicates in these constructions undergoes lexical coercion, and acquires a causative meaning. The newly-formed causative verb takes the other predicate of the construction as its complement. This structure is then interpreted with function-application. I hence argue that the structural difference between the two types of resultative constructions also mirrors the difference in the type of semantic operations used to interpret these constructions.</description><creator>Tomioka, Naoko.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Grammar, Comparative and general -- Resultative constructions.</subject><subject>Japanese language -- Resultative constructions.</subject><title>Resultative constructions : cross-linguistic variation and the syntax-semantics interface</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Naoko Tomioka, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xs55mh24h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6682x799g</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Linguistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nk322j932</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Divided into six chapters, our thesis examines the translation of Evgenyi Onegin, a novel in verse by Aleksandr Pushkin, in France and Japan in the 20th century. In Chapter 1, we introduce our methodological approach, including the eight elements of our translation analysis: the by-who, the who, the what, the for-who, the when, the why, the where, and the how. In Chapter 2, after a brief biography of the Russian poet, we examine his central work Evgenyi Onegin, and its unique structuro-phono-semantic synthesis. The first French mention of Pushkin was in the 19th century, and the 'transfer-related discourse' of that period is the focus of Chapter 3, particularly its creation of the myth of the poet's untranslatability, which would influence translators of the Pushkinian novel into the 20 th century. In Chapter 4, we examine the 11 French translations produced between 1902 and 1996. Because the Japanese discovery of foreign literature---and Pushkin---was the product of political changes during the Meiji period (1868-1912), it is paramount that we examine the pivotal role of 19 th century ideological discourse in which translation is viewed as a means and a condition for the country's modernization. Finally, in Chapter 6, we turn our attention to the 8 Japanese translations of the Pushkinian work produced between 1921 and 1996. Our aim is to demonstrate how the spatio-temporal change influenced the view of translation in general, and translations of Pushkin in particular.</description><creator>Teplova, Natalia.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Pushkin, Aleksandr Sergeevich, 1799-1837 -- Translations.</subject><subject>Pushkin, Aleksandr Sergeevich, 1799-1837.

Warm rolling temperatures between 640 and 750°C were employed, together with reductions of 65% to 80%. The effects of an additional cold rolling reduction of 40%, different initial hot band grain sizes (HBGSs) and a decrease in the heating rate during annealing were also studied. The ND fibre, &lt;111&gt;//ND, of the recrystallization texture was strengthened as the warm rolling temperature was decreased. A noticeable improvement in both the continuity and intensity of the ND fibre was obtained when samples were submitted to an additional 40% cold rolling reduction. The ND fibre was even more continuous and intense when a low heating rate was utilized, yielding r-values of 1.2 and 1.3 for the warm rolled and warm plus cold rolled samples, respectively. On the other hand, the volume fraction of grains containing shear bands is slightly lower for the finer HBGS. However, this does not reduce the amount of in-grain nucleation of gamma grains, suggesting that shear bands are not the only factor that has to be considered in the improvement of warm rolling textures. Although the normal anisotropy is not affected by the HBGS, much lower Deltar values were associated with the finer grained steel. The texture changes taking place during recrystallization were examined using electron back-scattered diffraction. The recrystallization textures resemble the deformation textures but with a more extensive alpha fibre that includes the {113}&lt;471&gt; orientation; the gamma fibre extends to the {554}&lt;225&gt;. These two orientations are related to the {112}&lt;110&gt; deformed grains by near 26º rotations about selected &lt;110&gt; axes. Nevertheless, both orientations appear in the early stages of recrystallization, an observation that does not support the oriented growth theory. The {111} &lt; hkl&gt; orientations are the first to recrystallize while the alpha fibre is present until the end of recrystallization. It is finally consumed by all types of grains as well as by subgrain coalescence. The relatively constant volume fractions of the main orientations and the similarities in the growth rates for the {111} &lt; hkl&gt; and random orientations suggest that recrystallization is controlled by the oriented nucleation concept.</description><creator>Sánchez Araiza, Miguel.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Engineering, Materials Science.</subject><title>Texture evolution in warm rolled low-carbon steels</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Miguel Sánchez Araiza, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/th83m356p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f4752m99v</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:th83m357z</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The neurotrophins are a family of growth factors involved in the survival, development, and apoptosis of specific populations of neurons and non-neuronal cells. The pro-apoptotic action of neurotrophins is, at least partially, carried out by the p75 neurotrophin Receptor (p75NTR). However the mechanism employed by p75NTR to mediate apoptosis is poorly defined. We used a yeast two-hybrid screen to find proteins involved in p75NTR apoptotic signaling. This screen led to the identification NRAGE (for neurotrophin receptor-interacting M AGE homologue), as a p75NTR interacting molecule. NRAGE is a novel member of the MAGE family of proteins, a group of molecules with ill-defined function, sharing a ~200 amino-acid region of homology. We found that NRAGE binds p75NTR in vitro and in vivo, and that the ectopic expression of NRAGE promotes p75NTR-dependent death in cells normally insensitive to p75NTR signaling. Furthermore, physical and functional assays indicated that the interaction of p75NTR with NRAGE, or that of p75NTR with its co-receptor TrkA, are mutually exclusive. To further dissect the mechanism of NRAGE mediated apoptosis, we developed an inducible recombinant NRAGE adenovirus. Induced NRAGE expression resulted in robust activation of the JNK pathway, cytosolic accumulation of Cytochrome c, activation of Caspases-3, -7 and -9 and caspase-dependent cell death. Accordingly, inhibition of the JNK pathway suppressed NRAGE-mediated caspase activation and NRAGE-induced cell death. The well-characterized activation of JNK-dependent cell death by NRAGE or p75NTR was then used as a model system to determine the mechanism-of-action of a novel anti-apoptotic pharmaceutical, AEG3482. Our studies revealed that AEG3482 almost completely blocks JNK-dependent apoptosis induced by p75NTR or NRAGE. The apoptotic inhibitory activity of AEG3482 was attributed to its ability to induce the expression of Heat-Shock Protein-70 (HSP70), which acts as a direct inhibitor of JNK activity. Therefore AEG3482 blocks cell death through an indirect inhbition of JNK. The identical sensitivity of p75NTR- and NRAGE-initiated signaling to AEG3482 or its analogues, provides further support for NRAGE as a mediator of p75NTR-induced apoptotic signaling. In summary, our results show that NRAGE contributes to p75NTR-dependent cell death via JNK-dependent activation of the mitochondrial death pathway.</description><creator>Salehi, Amir Hassan.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Characterization of NRAGE, a p75 neurotrophin receptor interacting protein and a mediator of p75 initiated apoptosis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Amir Hassan Salehi, 2005</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bz60d1846.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/th83m357z</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qv33s164w</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis we study the thermal and inertia effects on atomic friction. The Friction Force Microscope (FFM) is simulated with the Tomlinson model. We introduce a method to calculate atomic friction including thermal effects. A novel scaling form is proposed and tested. We also investigate the inertial effects of the bulk and the tips. We find if the bulk is weakly damped, there is hysteresis in the velocity versus driving force curve. When the tips are weakly damped, the friction force shows large deviations. In the first half of the thesis, we study the atomic friction between an FFM tip and a solid substrate at nonzero temperatures. Through theoretical analysis, we find the frictional force follows an universal scaling form F ∝ const---T2/31n 2/3(T/v), where T is temperature and v is scanning velocity. We test the theoretical results with numerical simulations. The FFM is simulated with the Tomlinson model. A tip is connected to a support with a spring. The support is pulled with a constant scanning velocity. We model the substrate with two different systems: one is a sinusoidal surface potential function for rigid substrate; the other is a ball-spring model for an elastic substrate. We find the friction force follows the scaling form well, with both kinds of substrates. This confirms the universality of our findings. The results also compare well to recent experimental work, permitting the quantitative extraction of microscopic parameters. In the second half of the thesis, we study the inertial effects on atomic friction with a multiple-tip Tomlinson model. The model consists of an array of tips mounted on a common bulk support. We find if the bulk is weakly damped and driven by an external force, there is hysteresis in the velocity versus driving force curve. The relative amount of hysteresis decreases with the number of tips for incommensurate systems. We also find that if the tips are weakly damped and experience longjumps, then when the bulk is pulled with a constant velocity, the total friction force shows a large deviation. The deviation exists even for incommensurate systems and cannot be averaged out by incorporating more tips. However, the deviation decreases with increasing temperatures. These findings provide new insights on the influence of the inertia of the bulk and the tips. They also shed some light on future multiple-tip FFM experiments.</description><creator>Sang, Yi, 1976-</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Physics, Condensed Matter.</subject><title>Thermal and inertial effects on atomic friction</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Yi Sang, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c821gq12t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qv33s164w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g158bn62t</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Salmonella typhimurium PhoP/PhoQ two-component system controls the expression of numerous genes involved in virulence. This system is activated in vivo within acidified macrophage phagosomes and is repressed in vitro in high concentrations of divalent cations such as Mg2+, Ca2+, and Mn2+ . The pho-24 allele of phoQ harbors a single amino acid substitution (T48I) in the periplasmic domain of the PhoQ histidine kinase sensor. This mutation has been shown to increase net phosphorylation of the PhoP response regulator. The mechanism by which pho-24 attenuates virulence is defined. The effect on signaling by PhoP/PhoQ of various amino acid substitutions at this position (PhoQ-T48X; X = A, S, V, I and L) were analyzed. Mutations T48V, T48I and T48L were found to affect signaling by PhoP/PhoQ both in vivo and in vitro. The data are consistent with a model in which the residue at position 48 of PhoQ contributes to a conformational switch between kinase- and phosphatase-dominant states. The purification and functional reconstitution of PhoQHis is also reported. Reconstituted PhoQHis exhibited all of the catalytic activities described for histidine sensor kinases. This tool allowed us to assess the role of the divalent cations Mg2+, Ca2+, and Mn2+ on reconstituted PhoQHis catalytic activities by varying the concentration of divalent cation acting as a ligand for the reconstituted PhoQHis, while maintaining a constant concentration of catalytic Mg2+. High concentrations (5 mM) of Mn 2+, and to a lesser extent Ca2+, are more potent than Mg2+ at repressing the net phosphorylation of PhoP by reconstituted PhoQHis, consistent with in vivo results. Antimicrobial peptides were also shown to directly activate the S. typhimurium PhoQ kinase sensor. The alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides C18G and LL-37 activation of reconstituted PhoQHis was shown and this activation can be competed with Mg2+. These findings contribute to a model in which antimicrobial peptides and divalent cations both play a role in initiating signal transduction through the PhoQ histidine kinase sensor.</description><creator>Sanowar, Sarah.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Biology, Microbiology.</subject><title>Ligand sensing and signal transduction by the Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium PhoQ histidine kinase sensor</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Sarah Sanowar, 2005</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dj52w888k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g158bn62t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cf95jg48q</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:34Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This work proposes a double analysis of the mundane society representations between 1885 and 1914, in the press and the novel. This analysis separates these two categories of media to insist on their particularities, and tries to think of them in terms of an interaction. A first part explores the organisation of the topics and the main genre of the mundane society in the press, applying the social discourse theory. The analysis is based on the perusal of a set of representative daily newspapers (Le Gaulois, Le Figaro) and of weekly and monthly publications (Le Grand monde, La Vie parisienne, Femina notably, as well as around thirty other titles). It shows that the mundane society in the newspaper is constrained by a poetics stemming from the characteristics of press writing: collective writing, periodicity of the publication, text length limitation and reference to reality. Some texts are tempted by fiction, even though they keep a reality-based referential, whereas other texts that are openly fictitious, fit the mundane fiction into the newspaper. The second part is based on the general conclusion of the first part: the mundane society in the newspaper is a represented society, made of for a distant and anonymous public. With the advent of the medias in the 19th century, the mundane society has entered into the era of mediations and "industrial writing". Some writers, from Bourget to Proust, take these upheavals into account and present the mundane society as a metaphor of the mass media society. This is done following three main axes: the temptation of withdrawal of the fiction into a closed world (psychological and mundane movement impulsed by Goncourt with Cherie, prolonged by Bourget and Hervieux notably); the games of exchange between the novel and the newspaper (Maupassant, Toulet, Legrand, amongst others); and finally, the isolation of the mundane world and the aesthetic work on mediations (Rolland, Colette, Mirbeau, Lorrain et Gide notably). All these writings address the question of sociability at the era of the triumph of mediations: what room is left for the mundane society, for direct encounter, for exchange, in a world of mediation and mass media coverage? for immediate connections in a society of mediated ties? The epilogue proposes a journalistic reading of A la recherche du temps perdu, synthesis-work which inaugurates a modern and sociological perception: it is in the world of the imagined mundane society, distant and represented in the mass media, that the narrator draws the resources for his observation of the world.</description><creator>Pinson, Guillaume, 1973-</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Press -- France -- History -- 20th century.</subject><subject>Worldliness in literature.</subject><subject>French literature -- 19th century -- History and criticism.</subject><subject>Press -- France -- History -- 19th century.</subject><subject>French literature -- 20th century -- History and criticism.</subject><title>Fiction du monde : analyse littéraire et médiatique de la mondanité, 1885-1914</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Guillaume Pinson, 2005</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/br86b7672.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cf95jg48q</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sj139630x</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:13:34Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>How are Centre parties distinct from Left and Right parties in term of their policy preferences? The scholarship on political parties either ignores Centre parties or treats them as a residual category. In this study, I attempt to rescue Centre parties from obscurity by looking at a quintessential Centre party: the Chilean Christian Democratic Party (PDC). Between 1990--2000, the PDC led two centre-left Concertacion coalition governments under Patricio Aylwin (1990--1994) and Eduardo Frei (1994--2000). It was the PDC's responsibility to negotiate the 'Chilean paradox': a country that had achieved economic success with neoliberalism and become a "model" for Latin America but where the "social debt" increased exponentially during 17 years of military rule under Augusto Pinochet (1973--1990). Health was one of the main concerns for Chileans through the decade but there was little headway made in the policy arena. My study seeks to explain why this was so. I make a distinction between (1) the "defensive" Centre which aspires to be neither left nor right; and (2) the "encompassing" Centre parties that are both left and right. Christian Democratic parties are "encompassing" Centre parties par excellence since they incorporate elements of both left and right ideologies in a manner consistent with their social Catholic beliefs. They are known to combine a conservative position on social and moral issues with a pro-poor orientation on welfare issues. The main policy dilemmas of the PDC emerged from its status as an "encompassing" Centre Party as it sought to reconcile left and right. During the 1990s, the PDC shifted allegiance from state-led development policies to neoliberalism. As a result, the scope of the party's commitment to welfare issues was defined within the range of options available within the neoliberal model. However, while neoliberals dominated key policy positions, statists retained influence in the Congress and within the party organization. The uneven nature of adaptation to neoliberalism became one of the main obstacles in reaching a consensus for reform. My study also gives due emphasis to the constraints introduced by the country's institutional framework, notably the 1980 Constitution inherited from the military regime.</description><creator>Pushkar.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Partido Demócrata-Cristiano (Chile)</subject><subject>Chile -- Politics and government -- 1988-</subject><subject>Medical policy -- Chile.</subject><title>Centre parties and the social question : the Christian Democratic Party (PDC) and health policies in Chile, 1990-2000</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Pushkar, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rv042z36j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sj139630x</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):42025</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
