In this attempt insurance companies are at different times defeated byconditions both within and beyond their control.

A recognition of the necessity for an adequate d~gree of diversification in their securities.3. The patriotic motive which dominated the trend during the War period.The main factors beyond their control have been:1.

The first problem can be termed a physical and chemical problem, and refers to the reasons for the firebrick reactions under impingement, carbon deposition and carbon penetration between temperatures 2000 F and 2300 F. The second problem can be termed a problem of design, and simply stated refers to a suggested design for a low cost and low maintenance refractory furnace, for an oil fired steam boiler. The third problem is a mechanical engineering problem and refers to the selection of proper firing equipment to suit the particular service, (type of steam demand) for which this equipment will be used. It is felt that a clear view on these three matters should contribute materially to reductions in the cost of operating oil fired boilers, while at the same time increasing their useful life. The test work which has been described raises the physical and chemical problem in a threefold manner as is evident both in the operating tests and in the laboratory tests.

Japp was unable to determine the nature of this chlorinated derivative from the evidenceat hand. While studying the reactions of cyclopentenolones with various inorganic halogen compounds in this laboratory, Spanagel (2) prepared a chloride isomeric with Japp' s, and found that it was easily converted into the latter by the action of dry hydrogen chloride.

This intention has, in the main, been carried out, but since most of the commoner species covered have been recorded from other Eastern provinces, and those that have not been recorded are almost certainly to be found there, I decided to give the paper its present title. The title is also suitable for the inclusion of a new species which is, so far, only recorded from Nova Scotia. On the other hand, I have not included species recorded from Ontario, except those taken at Ottawa or in the Ottawa district, unless they are recorded also from Quebec.The primary object of the paper is to make it possible for workers to recognize with little difficulty and absolute certainty the forms that are known to occur in this region. I had hoped that, while collecting material during two summers in the Abbotstord district, I would be able tolearn something of the biology of the group. However, other work claiming my attention at what seemed to me the most hopeful period, namely late June and early July, has prevented this, and, to my great regret, I have nothing to add to our scanty knowledge of this important subject.

That intemperate regions trees and exposed parts of shrubs and herbs are frozen solid for some time during the cold season and that the vast majoritysurvive this treatment regardless of the extremes of low temperature reached with slight if any injury, is a matter of common observation. Butthe slightest exposure of the plant to a few degrees of frost in the warm season, providing it is sufficient to cause freezing, is fatal.Death in this case is the direct result of the formation of ice as evidenced by the fact that a plant can be supercooled far below the freezingpoint of its tissues without injury; prevention of supercooling by stimulus to crystallization will result in the immediate death of the plant andthis at a temperature which if it is not at the freezing point of its tissues is well above that reached by supercooling without injury.

The extent of chlorination is an important factor in bleachingdue to (i) the instability of chlorinated organic compounds to subsequent oxidation, (ii) the increased solubility of chlorinated residues indilute alkali. Decrease in sulphur and methoxyl content may be considered as an index of chemical degradation. [...]</description><creator>Swartz, Joseph Norman.</creator><contributor>Hibbert, H.

The experiments werecarried out in a 3 ft. Marcy ball mill employing an Open end for pulp discharge.Test results showed an overloadling of the classifier in all experiments. The resulting inefficiency of classification prevented reliable conclusions as tothe effects of circulating loads on the grinding efficiency of the mill.Results, however, seem to indicate ore efficient grinding takes place in making a coarser finished product. A comparison between laboratory andcommercial mills shows the latter to be more efficient. This is open to criticism, however, because of classifying infficiency and mill operatingconditions.[...]</description><creator>O’Shaughnessy, Martin Daniel.</creator><contributor>Bell, J.

The deposits were formed by injection of an aqueous differentiate from the Morin magma, into fractured sillimanaite-garnetnear the contact with cuartzite. Following the crystallization of magnesite from the injected bodies, aqueous residues attacked the country rocksand formed the zone of hydrothermal alteration now referred to as the ore zone. The solutions acting during the period of hydrothermalalteration were richer in lime than the original differentiate. Consequently, dolomite formed from them as veins and replacements. In places, thelater solutions attacked the earlier formed magnesite and altered it to dolomite.The literature on magnesite deposits of the world is reviewed and the various types of magnesite deposits are described. A comparison shows thatthe Grenville deposits are more closely related to the sagvandite group of igneous rocks with primary magnesite, than to other deposits suchas those of the Veitsch type which are replacements of limestone.</description><creator>Buckland, Francis Channing.</creator><contributor>Osborne, F.

Furthermore, there, was no change in size of plant as measured by weight, diameter and height ofplants.With regard to wilting in cold storage no significant difference was noted between lots of celery from different nitrogen plots. Dry matterdeterminations likewise showed no significant difference between plots.Celery from the different nitrogen plots showed similar physical storage qualities, pithiness, breakdown of leaves and petioles,etc.Varying the nitrogen content of the fertilizer mixture did not change the total nitrogen content of the plant as no significant difference existingin quantities of total nitrogen in plants from different plots is determined by the Kjeldahl method. Only slight decreases were noted in the plantsthroughout the storage period. This decrease was uniform in celery from all plots throughout the storage period.Hexose sugars increased gradually until the end of the storage period, while sucrose sugars showed a slight decrease.It was concluded that the period of economical storage was 90 to 100 days under the conditions of this experiment.A carefully planned fertilizer experiment has been presented for consideration.</description><creator>Bourque, Leopold.</creator><contributor>Murray, H.

The significance of thesevarious stimuli is discussed in the introduction. I have investigated the mechanisms underlying certain phenomena of salivary secretion, viz.the 'augmented secretion' and the response of the 'paralytic' gland to sympathetic stimulation.These have been shown to depend not on a motor actionof the sympathetic, but on an increased irritability of the secretory cells; and the theory is advanced that this increased irritability is due toa passage of acetylcholine from the alveolar to the neighbouring demilune cells. The choline-esterase content of the cat's submaxillary gland isunaffected by degenerative section of the chorda tympani.
