It is obvious that economic growth is unlikely to start at all regions and sectors at the same time and proceed at the same speed. There are, however, reasons to believe that the split of some of the now underdeveloped economies into advanced and traditional sectors may be of considerable width and duration and this split may turn them into "dual economies".</description><creator>Mubarak, Nasreldin.</creator><contributor>Brecher, I.

The ability or virulent tubercle bacilli to penetrate and to multiply intracellularly causing damage to the host cell has not yet been fully explained.

One problem which seems especially appropriate for investigation with such methods concerns the neural mechanisms of conditioning. The present study approaches this problem by the use of intra-cranial stimulation as a conditioned stimulus.

The medulla was shown to develop a blue colour with ferric sulphate (Colin, 1856), while the formation of a brown colour on adding dichromate to adrenal extracts was described by Menle in 1865. These observations laid the foundation for subsequent attempts to estimate adrenaline by chemical means. Following the isolation of the physiologically active principle of the adrenal medulla, by Takamine and by Aldrich (1901), attempts were made to utilise various colour reactions for the estimation of adrenaline in medullary extracts.</description><creator>Millar, Ronald.

It has been postulated that the increased incidence of relapse is a result of a lack in the production of natural immunity during the course of infection caused by a destruction or alteration of the antigenic components of Salmonella typhosa due to its exposure to chloramphenicol.

Variables were 1) initial pre-tension 2) thickness of angle 3) ratio moment shear. The results obtained are compared with existing information. The rotation is found to be due to angle deformation and column deformation. The effect or the column flange stiffness on the connection characteristics are analyzed. The effect of the history of the connection is shown also. The determination or pre-tension in the bolts is described as well as the complete instrumentation and behaviour during test.</description><creator>Mathison, William.</creator><contributor>De Stein, J.

For such a potential a solution to Schrödinger’s equation is derived for orbital angular momentum zero. This solution is used to obtain the wall depths of the potential between a /\ particle and an H3 core. Using this result the solution is next applied to the scattering of a /\ particle by a nucleon and cross-sections are obtained for the outgoing /\ and E particles. The indication from these calculations is that the isotopic spin dependent term in the /\ -nucleon potential is the dominant one.</description><creator>Masson, David.

They suggested that ethanol is completely burned in the organism to carbon dioxide. Although this observation was confirmed by others, the general belief persisted that ethanol was not oxidised at all, but was eliminated unchanged (2). This theory was based on the results of the animal experiments formed about 1870 which showed that ethanol appeared both in the urine and expired air. Later, Dupre, Anstie and others (3,4,5,6) found that most of the administered ethanol disappears and that the amounts recovered in the urine represent only a very small fraction of the original dose.</description><creator>Majchrowicz, Edward.</creator><contributor>Quastel, J.

However, activity in space and flight over the high seas have one big thing in common - they are both badly in need of an international agreement. The main purpose of this thesis is to attempt to prove the great need of a multi-lateral Convention covering flight over the high seas. Despite the phenomenal increase of activities in and claims to the airspace over the high seas during the last twenty years, it is still being regulated by legal thinking which was popular in 1919.</description><creator>MacKneson, Stephen.

The thesis attempts to answer three major questions: First, it asks whether persistent sodium currents regulate intrinsic excitability of entorhinal cortical layer V, which has been demonstrated to exhibit epileptogenic characteristics. Second, it asks whether persistent sodium currents may be up-regulated in an acquired temporal lobe epilepsy rodent model (lithium-pilocarpine), whose features strongly correlate with human temporal lobe epilepsy. Third, it asks whether persistent sodium currents may be up-regulated in a genetic epilepsy model, which overexpresses a mutation affecting the structure of the sodium ion channel and which strongly correlates with the phenotype of generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+). Our results reveal that persistent sodium currents may be linked to the pathogenesis of acquired temporal lobe epilepsy and GEFS+. In the first study, examining entorhinal cortex layer V neurons, we found that persistent sodium currents promote subthreshold oscillations and the generation of low-threshold spikes. Cells exhibited persistent currents with the following: (a) an amplitude that is approximately 1% of the peak transient current; (b) a ~10 mV hyperpolarized shift in the activation curve relative to that of transient current; (c) a higher single channel conductance (18.7 pS), which is distinct from that of the transient current; (d) prolonged macropatch (nPo) channel openings with increasingly latent delays for more positive voltage depolarizations, which helps distinguish persistent currents from the modal gating of transient currents;(e) a time- and voltage-dependence of current inactivation; and (f) an activation profile distinct from that due to a theoretical window current. Overall, this study helped confirm the importance of persistent currents for the epileptogenic properties of the entorhinal cortex. In the second study, we examined sodium currents in an acquired temporal lobe epilepsy model. In this lithium-pilocarpine model, we found that persistent sodium currents may undergo neural plasticity after status epilepticus (SE) induction. More specifically, our results show the following: (a) persistent sodium currents appear to be up-regulated after a "silent period", as demonstrated by a two-fold increase in persistent current densities at nine-to-twelve weeks post-SE within entorhnal cortex layer V neurons; (b) sodium channel alpha-subunit protein expression appear to be downregulated, with a statistically significant decrease in alpha3-subunit expression compared to alpha1, alpha2, and alpha6; (c) sodium channel beta1 subunit appear to be up-regulated, relative to beta2 subunit; and (d) all messenger RNA transcripts (Nav1.1a, Nav1.6a) appear to be downregulated except for Nav1.3a. The results may suggest that acute neurological injury could result in structural and functional changes in sodium channels, which enhance persistent currents, and promote temporal lobe epilepsy. In the third study, within transgenic GEFS+ (C121Wbeta1) model, we studied whether genetic alterations could influence persistent sodium current properties within superficial entorhinal cortical neurons. Our results demonstrate the following: (a) enhanced expression of WTbeta1 transgenics produces greater transient sodium current attenuation at all stimulation frequencies; (b) enhanced expression of C121Wbeta1 mutants evokes a resistance to such cumulative attenuation, in a manner similar to that of controls, only at higher frequencies (40- and 80-Hz); (c) enhanced expression of C121W mutants produces statistically larger persistent sodium currents relative to controls; and d) both overexpressed C121Wbeta1 mutants and overexpressed WTbeta1 transgenics display depolarized shifts in steady-state activation and inactivation.

We uncovered a role for the adaptor protein Nck in modulating the UPR. In this study, we report that obese Nck1-/- mice, which show lower levels of UPR in liver and adipose tissue, present improved insulin signalling in these tissues. We established that the effect of Nck1 is cell autonomous by showing that HepG2 cells treated with Nck1 siRNA have reduced ER stress-induced UPR and Insulin Receptor Substrate-1 (IRS-1) serine phosphorylation. In these cells, we observed that the IRS-1 levels and activation of signalling components downstream of the insulin receptor were increased. This correlates with enhanced cell survival to stress and insulin stimulated glycogen synthesis. Overall, we demonstrated that Nck1 participates in ER-stress-induced insulin resistance and regulation of IRS-1-dependent signalling.</description><creator>Laberge, Marie-Kristine.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Insulin -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins</subject><subject>Endoplasmic Reticulum -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Protein Folding.</subject><subject>Insulin Resistance.</subject><subject>Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing -- metabolism.</subject><title>Nck1 is required for ER stress-induced insulin resistance and regulation of IRS1-dependent insulin signalling</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/br86b7095.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x920g1460</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jw827g490</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:16:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Vascular access-related bloodstream infection (BSI) is frequent among patients undergoing hemodialysis increasing significantly their morbidity and mortality. Studies assessing centre- and patient-predictors of BSI have had inadequate sample size and follow-up time. The aims of this project are: to describe the incidence rates; and to determine patient- and centre-level predictors of BSI in a cohort of incident hemodialysis patients treated in teaching or community hospitals, and in First Nation dialysis units. The rates of BSI in our population were lower than those observed in other settings. Central venous catheters were the most important risk factor for BSI and their use in our study was much higher than recommended. Some variability in BSI rates was found among centres, but no centre-related variable was found to be associated with the risk of BSI. Effort to reduce catheter use in hemodialysis patients may significantly reduce the risk of BSI in this patient population.</description><creator>Lafrance, Jean-Philippe.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Quebec -- epidemiology.</subject><subject>Catheterization, Central Venous -- adverse effects -- Quebec.</subject><subject>Catheters, Indwelling -- adverse effects -- Quebec.</subject><subject>Catheter-Related Infections -- epidemiology -- Quebec</subject><subject>Renal Dialysis -- adverse effects -- Quebec.</subject><title>Determinants of vascular access-related bloodstream infections among patients receiving hemodialysis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k0698c30t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jw827g490</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):17325</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
