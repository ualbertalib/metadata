My main goal is to  highlight the importance of sex education for young people in Javanese society.  Research foci and discoveries include: how the notions of conservatism with regards  to sexuality are rooted in Javanese culture and social values; the definitions,  history, components, methods and principles of Western sex education (particularly  Canadian); the measures of success for sex education programs in the West; and to  what extent Western sex education can be applied to Javanese society. In the final  chapter I offer recommendations for Javanese educational authorities on the need to  create a new terminology of sex education.</description><creator>Husni Rahiem, Maila Dinia</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Javanese (Indonesian people) -- Sexual behavior</subject><subject>Sex instruction -- Indonesia -- Java</subject><subject>Java (Indonesia) -- Social life and customs</subject><title>Learning from the west : sexuality education in taboo Javanese society</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tq57nr54w.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6m311p89m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Integrated Studies in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cz30pt33k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>On examining novels written in Quebec after the 1950s,  surprisingly some common themes emerge. One finds progressively increasing  references to the themes of the book, the library, and the author. In this thesis,  we study the fictional work of Gerard Bessette and Jacques Poulin, two authors who  make abundant references to the universe of the book. Their characters read, write,  work and even live in libraries and bookshops. We will discuss the concept of the library, in order to clarify  various key issues. Our definition of the library will include any place where books  are read or stored. In other words, we do not intend to limit our study only to the  traditional library, but rather to extend it to any place which shelters books. The  concept of the library is thus taken in its broadest definition and includes the  bookshop, the office, or even the bus. These books were selected because each author gives an account  of contemporary Quebec history. In addition, the opposing themes in these fictitious  worlds, seem to be at the core of the concept of the library. Indeed, it is at the  same time both closedness and openness, both hoarding and lending. We will examine  how the paradoxical realities are presented in these novels.</description><creator>Crainic, Corina</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Poulin, Jacques, 1937-</subject><subject>Bessette, Gérard -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><subject>Libraries in literature</subject><title>Représentation de la bibliothèque chez Bessette et Poulin</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2n49t2512.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cz30pt33k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5d86p094c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis I ask: "What are Nova Scotia women's  narratives concerning authority in their education? Does 'shyness' come into play in  these educational narratives? What are the ways in which these women accepted and/or  resisted authority?" This research grows from my position as an academic  initiate, and my experiences of "growing up girl" in Nova Scotia. Using a  qualitative feminist methodology, I interviewed three women who moved through the  Nova Scotia educational system. Here I situate their stories in relation to  scholarly work on authority and the context of class, race, and gender in Nova  Scotia, and explore the strategies the women undertook to enact agency in their  educational lives. These narratives provide rich perspectives on power, agency, and  authority as they are lived in local contexts, and point to a need for more  educational stories to be told by women of all backgrounds in Nova Scotia and  beyond.</description><creator>Cameron, Paula</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Authority</subject><subject>Women -- Education -- Nova Scotia</subject><title>A little ground to stand on : Nova Scotia women's narratives on authority and education</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3b591905z.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5d86p094c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Integrated Studies in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9019s305m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The species richness, abundance and composition of saproxylic  Coleoptera was compared between 'old-growth' and mature-managed hemlock-hardwood  forests in southeastern Ontario, Canada. Beetles were sampled weekly from 29 April  until 3 October 2003 using large-area flight-intercept traps (FITs) and trunk-window  traps (TTs). Analyses were conducted using the Fisher's alpha and Simpson's  diversity indices, rarefaction, indicator species analysis and cluster analysis. A  total of 11,888 fungivorous Coleoptera was collected from 11 families and 73 species  (excluding Nitidulidae). Nitidulidae were analysed separately with traps yielding  2,129 sap beetles comprising 30 species. The species richness and abundance of  fungivorous Coleoptera did not differ significantly between the two forest types.  Conversely, the species abundance of nitidulid beetles was higher in managed forests  and the species richness higher in 'old-growth' forests. Several species were  strongly associated with either managed or 'old-growth' forest types. Certain  species such as Anisotoma inops (Leiodidae) and Glischrochilus sanguinolentus  (Nitidulidae) were much more frequently caught in TTs than in FITs.</description><creator>Zeran, Rebecca</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Old growth forest ecology -- Ontario, Southern.</subject><subject>Beetles -- Effect of forest management on -- Ontario, Southern.</subject><subject>Beetles -- Ontario, Southern -- Geographical distribution.</subject><subject>Nitidulidae -- Ontario, Southern -- Geographical distribution.</subject><subject>Nitidulidae -- Effect of forest management on -- Ontario, Southern.</subject><subject>Insect-fungus relationships -- Ontario, Southern.</subject><title>Biodiversity of saproxylic Coleoptera in 'old-growth' and managed forests in southeastern Ontario</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/td96k316v.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9019s305m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:44558d88m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis critically surveys the dynamics of social work  modernization in the state of Indonesia. The study examines the polarization,  characteristics and trends of social work throughout the history of Indonesia. The  survey begins by reviewing the two contexts of the historical developments of social  work in both the developed and developing countries of the Third World. This  historical overview is pivotal to place the context of social work development in  Indonesia. Tracing the origins and the nature of 'social work' in Indonesia under  the pre- and colonial rule will further highlight the course of its development. The  adoption of modern social work in the post-colonial is examined afterward. The  historical examination of social work in Indonesia is particularly relevant in  underscoring the roots of the present criticism leveled at Indonesian social policy  and work.</description><creator>Hakim, Budi Rahman</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Social service -- Indonesia -- History</subject><subject>Social service -- Indonesia</subject><title>Modernization of social work and the state : a critical survey of its historical development in Indonesia</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wp988k45j.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/44558d88m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0c483j908</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The use of chemically modified oligonucleotides (AON) to  selectively inhibit the expression of genes involved in pathological processes,  offers a rational approach for the prevention and treatment of some disorders.  Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (PS-DNA), in which one of the non-bridging oxygen  atoms of the internucleotide linkage is replaced by a sulfur atom, have been  extensively studied and are among the most widely used "antisense"  oligonucleotides (AON).

During embryonic development, the guidance cue netrin-1 signals through  Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) receptors to modulate actin cytoskeleton  dynamics, enhancing the formation and motility of filopodia. We recently reported  that netrin-1 and DCC continue to be expressed in the adult spinal cord, but their  function remains elusive. Here, we report that netrin-1 and DCC are expressed in  adult cortical and hippocampal neurons, where they distribute to synaptic sites. In  primary cortical neuron cultures, while netrin-1 is restricted to dendrites, DCC  localizes to both axonal and dendritic compartments. We find that netrin-1 increases  the density of axonal and dendritic filopodia and branches in a DCC-dependent  manner. We demonstrate that, although dispensable for synapse formation and  maintenance, netrin-1-DCC signaling enhances the number and efficacy of synaptic  sites in vitro. These observations suggest a novel role for netrin-1 and DCC in  synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity.</description><creator>Tritsch, Nicolas X.</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Netrin-1 signaling through DCC enhances synapse number and function</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1r66j156t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t722h9449</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vq27zn98m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The market life of many fruits and vegetables can be extended  through storage at low temperatures. Chilling injury (CI) is a major postharvest  storage problem for tropical commodities. Storing these products at temperatures  below their critical temperature may result in severe physiological disorders known  as CI symptoms. Mangoes (Mangifera indica. L) are susceptible to CI when stored  below 12 °C. Visual CI symptoms include uneven ripening, surface pitting,  discoloration, shriveling and scalding. Research has been conducted to overcome  these serious problems using various postharvest treatments such as hot water,  methyl jasmonate (MJ) or diphenylamine (DPA) with some reduction of the incidence of  CI symptoms in fruits and vegetables. Experiments were performed to assess and compare the potential  of the above-mentioned postharvest treatments to reduce the CI symptoms on mango cv.  Kent. The obtained results indicated that MJ- and DPA-treatments gave significantly  greater percentage of marketable fruits. Experiments were also conducted with mangoes cv. Tommy Atkins  treated with MJ and DPA before storing at low temperatures (1, 4, 7 and  10°C). The chemical treatments were successful at reducing CI symptoms of  mangoes. Fruit decay was reduced during subsequent ripening. MJ-treated fruits had  lower mass loss and higher total soluble solids (TSS) than the control treatment.  The overall quality of MJ- and DPA-treated fruits was good with lower surface  pitting and scalding compared with the control treatment. The best results were  obtained at storage temperatures of 7 and 10°C. Both MJ and DPA postharvest  treatments can reduce CI symptoms in mangoes cvs. Kent and Tommy Atkins when the  mangoes are stored at below critical temperature.</description><creator>Tasneem, Azra</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Mango -- Storage -- Diseases and injuries.</subject><subject>Mango -- Postharvest losses -- Prevention.</subject><subject>Diphenylamine.</subject><title>Postharvest treatments to reduce chilling injury symptoms in stored mangoes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3b5919067.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vq27zn98m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Bioresource Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fn106z72x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Several methods can be used in cluster-randomized studies with  binary outcome, including GLMM, GEE, and ordinary logistic regression. In this  thesis, we study cluster-randomized data with large cluster sizes relative to the  number of clusters (for example, the PROBIT study). We compared GLMM, GEE, and  ordinary logistic regression approaches in terms of parameter interpretation,  magnitude, and standard errors of model parameters. A simulation study was performed  to evaluate the performance of these methods. GLMM implemented with penalized  quasi-likelihood performed well. It gave the highest empirical confidence interval  coverage of the true coefficients at 95% level of confidence. GEE was robust with  the smallest MSE when within group correlation sigma u ≥ 0.5. Logistic  regression models performed well when the correlation was very weak, but fared  poorly when the correlation was stronger. When correlations are quite low, logistic  models may be acceptable for clustered data; however, they give inappropriate  inference when correlation is elevated.</description><creator>Tan, Ye</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Statistics.</subject><title>A comparison of approaches to analysis of clustered binary data when cluster sizes are large /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/73666509f.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fn106z72x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:db78tc58r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The early Tertiary marked a period of intense magmatic activity  in the Canadian Cordillera as a consequence of tectonic restructuring within the  Kula-North American plate system from orthogonal to oblique convergence. Resultant  calc-alkaline volcanism formed a discontinuous belt (Challis Arc) along the eastern  margin of the Coast Plutonic Complex (CPC) from south-eastern Alaska through Yukon  into west-central British Columbia and northern Washington State. The Sifton Range  volcanic complex (SRVC) is the Yukon's largest Paleogene erosional remnant of  volcanic rocks (240 km2), and represents the only coeval volcanic-plutonic suite  within the Sloko-Skukum Group of southern Yukon Territory and northern British  Columbia. It comprises a 900-m thick, shallow-dipping, volcanic succession dominated  by intermediate to evolved lavas and abundant felsic pyroclastics deposited in a  north-westerly trending half-graben. Three volcano-stratigraphic units are  documented: (1) Lower Interbedded Unit, (2) Middle lavas, and (3) Upper Interbedded  Unit. Locally, the volcanic sequence is intruded by biotite, hornblende,  two-feldspar granites of the CPC's Nisling plutonic suite dated at 57.5 Ma. Felsite  sills radiate from the main intrusive body, and together with numerous basaltic to  dacitic dykes traverse the entire volcanic package.

To be  successful, such efforts must recognize the underlying logic of resource-users'  livelihood choices. This study uses the activity of aquarium fish extraction in the  Peruvian Amazon as a case study through which to examine the role that physical and  non-physical assets (primarily knowledge) might play in determining households'  participation patterns. An initial survey of the regional trade, undertaken through  interviews with trade participants (n = 38) and analysis of government documents,  revealed a large, valuable and complex industry. Data gathered through surveys among  households in two proximate fishing villages (n = 37) indicated large inter- and  intra-village variation in trade participation.

We find that the sequential spectral method is related to Waveform  Relaxation methods and to iterative schemes that precede its inception by a  century. Using the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations, we compare  the performance of the sequential spectral method with two traditional numerical  pseudospectral Galerkin frameworks: a semi-implicit time discretization, and a  traditional fully implicit discretization. We depart from preceding implementations  of the sequential spectral method by developing an entirely parallel algorithm. We  also introduce periodic boundary conditions. We deviate even further from previous  implementations by incorporating the Fast Fourier Transform to accelerate the  performance of the method, and by tackling large-scale problems. We show that the  sequential spectral method is efficient for large-scale problems of hundreds of  thousands of unknown variables, whereas traditional implicit methods are highly  inefficient. We find that the computational time of the sequential spectral method  is significantly better than that of the traditional implicit scheme, and  competitive with that of the semi-implicit scheme, which has the lowest  computational time consumption. The new sequential spectral scheme produces  solutions that are identical to the traditional implicit implementation. We find  that the solutions agree with turbulence results, producing an energy spectrum that  has a slope of approximately -3, in agreement with theory. We analyse the convergence of the sequential spectral method and  derive theoretical sufficient conditions for convergence for Burger's equation in  one dimension. We conduct numerical experiments, which confirm the validity of the  theoretical results.</description><creator>Gwamanda, Bhekumuzi J.</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Mathematics.</subject><title>The sequential spectral method for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in two dimensions /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1n79h502g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/37720d36f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1c18dg27c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Recent studies suggest that caspases are involved in neuronal  apoptosis and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, which effector caspase plays an  essential role in AD pathogenesis is still elusive. Caspase-6 is implicated as a  main effector caspase in human primary neuron culture (LeBlanc et al., 1999; Zhang  et al., 2000). Therefore, the first objective of my study is to investigate whether  caspase-6 is involved in AD. We generated an antiserum (1277) recognizing the p20  subunit of caspase-6. By using the 1277 antiserum, we investigate fifteen AD and  eight control brains from Canadian brain tissue bank. We observe 2-3 fold increase  of p20 subunit of caspase-6 in AD (p&lt;0.03, ANOVA) compared to controls. The  results imply caspase-6 activation in AD. Although caspase-6 is thought to be essential in neuronal  apoptosis and AD, it is elusive as to how caspase-6 is activated. The second  objective of my study is to determine if another caspase is activating caspase-6. We  observe that caspase-1 activation precedes caspase-6 activity in serum-deprived  human neurons. A caspase-1 inhibitor prevents caspase-6 activation and resultant  cell death. These results suggest that caspase-1 is essential in caspase-6  activation in apoptotic human neurons. Our study demonstrates the involvement of caspase-6 in AD and  the role of caspase-1 in caspase-6 activation, which may help find a possible  treatment for AD in the future.</description><creator>Guo, Huishan</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Caspase-6 activation in Alzheimer's disease and neuronal apoptosis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8p58pd537.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1c18dg27c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kh04dq25f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In order to perform meaningful experiments in optimizing  compilation and runtime system design, researchers usually rely on a suite of  benchmark programs of interest to the optimization technique under consideration.  Programs are described as numeric, memory-intensive, concurrent, or object-oriented,  based on a qualitative appraisal, in some cases with little  justification. In order to make these intuitive notions of program behaviour  more concrete and subject to experimental validation, this thesis introduces a  methodology to objectively quantify key aspects of program behaviour using dynamic  metrics. A set of unambiguous, dynamic, robust and architecture-independent dynamic  metrics is defined, and can be used to categorize programs according to their  dynamic behaviour in five areas: size, data structures, memory use, polymorphism and  concurrency. Each metric is also empirically validated. A general-purpose, easily extensible dynamic analysis framework  has been designed and implemented to gather empirical metric results. This framework  consists of three major components. The profiling agent collects execution data from  a Java virtual machine. The trace analyzer performs computations on this data, and  the web interface presents the result of the analysis in a convenient and  user-friendly way. The utility of the approach as well as selected specific metrics  is validated by examining metric data for a number of commonly used benchmarks. Case  studies of program transformations and the consequent effects on metric data are  also considered. Results show that the information that can be obtained from the  metrics not only corresponds well with the intuitive notions of program behaviour,  but can also reveal interesting behaviour that would have otherwise required lengthy  investigations using more traditional techniques.</description><creator>Dufour, Bruno</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Objective quantification of program behaviour using dynamic metrics</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gb19f645b.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kh04dq25f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7s75dd07q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Since their discovery, transposable elements (TEs) have been  regarded either as useful building blocks of genomes, or as "selfish DNA":  genetic parasites that exploit the sexual cycle to spread in copy number within  populations to the detriment of their hosts. If the "selfish DNA"  hypothesis is correct, TEs are expected to deteriorate and be lost from asexual  populations. This thesis tests the predictions of the "selfish DNA"  hypothesis in four asexual plant species, focusing on patterns of nucleotide  diversity and nucleotide substitution. Sequences bearing strong resemblance to known  TE families including Ty1/copia, Ty3/gypsy, and LINE-like elements were successfully  isolated from all four plant species, and showed patterns of nucleotide substitution  consistent with a long history of purifying selection. Stochastic simulations were  also conducted, and suggested that this result is expected if the host species has  been asexual for less than tens of thousands of generations.</description><creator>Docking, T.

However, several complications may arise  following the procedure, such as Bronchiolitis Obliterans (BO). This condition,  characterized by small airway fibrosis, remains a major cause of morbidity and  mortality in patients following lung transplantation. It is thought to be a  manifestation of chronic rejection within the airways, with hallmark inflammation  and fibroproliferation. TGF-beta and other cytokines, including IL-1, IFN-gamma and  PDGF, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of fibrosis, mostly in animal models.  IL-11 and IL-17 are novel profibrotic cytokines that induce fibroblasts and  epithelial cells to produce excess extracellular matrix. They have recently been  identified as having a role in tissue remodelling and induction of tissue fibrosis.  We hypothesize that IL-11 and IL-17 are involved in chronic lung rejection  (Bronchiolitis Obliterans) and that their expression could be a predictive and  prognostic marker of chronic lung rejection. The objectives of the study were to investigate the expression  of IL-11 and IL-17 (mRNA and protein) in endobronchial biopsies from lung transplant  patients and to define the correlation between the expression of IL-11 and IL-17 and  the development of chronic rejection.</description><creator>Al-Kerithy, Mohammed</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</subject><title>Role of IL-17 and IL-11 in immunopathology of chronic rejection post-lung transplantation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j67314534.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c821gk448</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pathology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6m311p90c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Previous research has shown that Japanese-speaking 20-month-old  children associate novel words with objects over actions when the words are  presented as a single word. This study investigated young Japanese children's  ability to use verb morphosyntactic cues in input to form associations between novel  words and actions using a habituation paradigm with a switch design. Sixteen  20-month-old Japanese children were habituated to novel words in a verb syntactic  frame paired with movies that show novel objects engaging in unfamiliar actions. The  children were then tested with three trials in which one of the original word,  object, or action was switched. The results indicate that children mapped the novel  words onto the actions, rather than onto the objects. These, along with the previous  findings, suggest that Japanese children become sensitive to verb morphosyntactic  cues in input and use them in learning words for actions by the age of 20  months.</description><creator>Ariyama, Junko</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Psychology, Developmental.</subject><title>Use of morphosyntactic cues to word in 20-month-old Japanese children</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rx913q48q.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6m311p90c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Communication Sciences and Disorders</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wp988k46t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Solution methods for MDPs employing approximation allow for more  acceptable computation time in domains with large state spaces.

Previous studies have reported both costimulatory and coinhibitory  roles for this glycoprotein in T cell activation and effector functions. We have  used a Ceacam1-/- mouse model to further explore this paradox. We demonstrate that  CEACAM1 is not involved in T cell development or in migration of these lymphocytes  to peripheral lymphoid organs. In vitro, CEACAM1 was observed to play an inhibitory  role on T lymphocytes as it limits T cell proliferation in response to T cell  receptor-specific antibodies and mitogens. In vivo proliferative responses were not  affected by the absence of CEACAM1 upon administration of antigen emulsified with  adjuvant, yet cytokine secretion revealed that CEACAM1 may be involved in the  control of Th1-type responses. A new transgenic model for CEACAM1 overexpression on  T lymphocytes was generated and further experimentation will be necessary to confirm  the above observations. Hence, CEACAM1 is playing an inhibitory role on T cell  surfaces, most likely by intracellular signal transmission through its ITIM  motifs.</description><creator>Farrah, Jennifer</creator><contributor>Beauchemin, Nicole (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><title>CEACAMI as a negative regulator of T cell functions</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d504rk87g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7w62f8790</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ng451j08d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Phenotypic characterizations demonstrated that diversity among  19 naturalized North American and 5 commercial Kura clover ( Trifolium ambiguum  M.B.) rhizobial strains was limited.

Nitrogen fertilization, however,  produced greater accumulations in all evaluations. Genetic diversity among 128  isolates from the lower Caucasus was significant. Nodulation specificity of rhizobia  from the lower Caucasus was demonstrated to be more complex than what was reported  in the literature, as plants of different ploidy levels and even of different  species were, in some cases, nodulated by the same isolate.

With your ticket you bought several days before, you come to the airport, check in, pay airport's fees, go through the customs and security checks, walk in the terminal following signs, maybe you stop in the duty free shops, and finally find your gate. By this time, you are ready to board, about one hour after you enter the airport. We will be essentially interested in air law that is why, the purpose of this master's thesis is to consider the legal aspect of facilitation in civil aviation. The term facilitation refers to the process that passengers, crew, luggage, cargo and mail have to go through when they cross borders to fly from a point A to a point B. Recently, an aspect of facilitation took an outstanding importance: health issues. At the end of last year, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak was a real threat to international civil aviation because passengers (and crews) could have been exposed to an infected person inside the terminal or on board the plane, also, aircrafts were considered a fast vector of this disease through the world. The economic consequences for airlines and airports were very painful. iBoeing 777-300 Extended Range.</description><description>Vous avez probablement remarqué qu'embarquer à bord d'un B777-300ERii à Genève pour Anchorage via Londres n'est pas aussi simple qu'il le paraît. En arrivant à l'aéroport avec son billet d'avion acheté plusieurs jours auparavant, il faut commencer par l'enregistrement, puis payer les taxes, passer les douanes et les contrôles de sûreté, se repérer dans l'aérogare en suivant les panneaux tout en s'arrêtant éventuellement aux boutiques hors taxes, pour finalement arriver à la porte d'embarquement. Dès lors, vous êtes prêt à embarquer environ une heure après être entré dans l'aéroport. En nous concentrant essentiellement sur le droit aérien, nous nous proposons d'aborder dans le cadre de ce mémoire de maîtrise, la problématique légale de la facilitation dans l'aviation civile. Le terme de facilitation se réfère au processus par lequel passagers, équipages, bagages, cargo et courrier vont devoir accomplir en traversant les frontières pour voler d'un point A à un point B. Récemment, les considérations de santé publique dans le cadre de la facilitation ont fait l'objet d'une plus grande attention. A la fin de l'année dernière, le
Syndrome Respiratoire Aigu Sévère (SRAS) a constitué une menace importante pour l'aviation civile internationale tant par le fait qu'un passager malade pouvait transmettre la maladie à d'autres passagers (et équipages), mais aussi par le fait que l'avion est apparu comme un vecteur très rapide de la maladie à travers le monde. Les conséquences économiques, tant pour les compagnies aériennes que pour les aéroports, ont été très dommageables. </description><creator>Poget, Gaël</creator><contributor>Milde, Michael (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Aeronautics, Commercial -- Law and legislation.</subject><subject>Aeronautics, Commercial -- Passenger traffic</subject><subject>Communicable diseases -- Prevention.</subject><subject>Airline passenger security screening</subject><subject>Public health laws, International.</subject><title>Legal aspects of facilitation in civil aviation : health issues</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x059c808f.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cr56n175s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5712m7199</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This work focuses on the special problems in the context of  drafting the corporate charter and bylaws for American corporations the stocks of  which are mainly owned by the members of one family. Although the ownership  structure would also allow a partnership organization, there can be good reasons for  choosing the corporate structure. Nevertheless, the family owners will want to  preserve a partnership-like structure and a maximum amount of ownership influence.  However, the three-tiered structure of the corporation (board of directors,  officers, and shareholders) and their individual functions are fixed by a  "statutory model" that the courts tend to adhere to and that has often  been written into positive corporate statutes. Hence, for each organizational level, this work tries to fathom  the permissible deviations from the statutory model in order to maintain and  exercise family influence. Furthermore, the special legal forms provided by the legislators  (especially "close corporation status") will be  considered. Because American corporate law is within the province of the  state legislators, the work takes a comparative approach. Guided by the criteria of  practical applicability and comparative interest, the Model Business Corporation Act  as well as the state laws of Delaware, New York, California, and Nevada were  selected.</description><creator>Rothaermel, Thomas</creator><contributor>Walsh, Catherine (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Family owned</subject><subject>Family-owned business enterprises -- Law and legislation -- United States</subject><subject>Corporation law -- United States</subject><title>Possibilities of securing and exercising family influence in U.S. companies a comparative analysis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zc77sq69n.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5712m7199</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:d217qq13n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis, the author studies the ethical and legal aspects  of research conducted on stored tissue samples of deceased persons in North  America. The first part of this thesis presents an overview of what  constitutes human tissues and how are they used in research. The author describes  the process in which human tissues are acquired and stored by health facilities,  their utility for scientific research, and currently used  techniques. The second part is dedicated to the analysis of the current  normative framework associated with research involving human tissue samples in North  America. The author underlines the presence of two different normative regimes  depending on whether the human tissues were removed before or after death. Finally,  the author examines international documents in order to evaluate whether or not they  can provide guidance to North American national legislation. The third part evaluates the normative limitations associated  with the use of stored tissue samples of deceased persons for research. The author  considers that these limitations are related to the presence of conflicting  interests, the difficulties in establishing rights over human tissues, the  difficulties of establishing the rights of the dead, and the limitations of the  theory of informed consent with regards to stored tissue samples. The last part of this thesis suggests that stored human tissues  should be interpreted as if they were part of an individual's medical record. After  presenting some of the philosophical arguments in favour of such an interpretation,  the author underlines the presence of legal precedents supporting the "tissue  as information" model. The author finally examines the legal implications and  the potential limitations of this proposal.</description><creator>Letendre, Martin</creator><contributor>Glass, Kathleen (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2004</date><subject>Medicine -- Research -- Law and legislation -- United States</subject><subject>Property -- Canada</subject><subject>Body, Human -- Law and legislation -- United States</subject><subject>Property -- United States</subject><subject>Body, Human -- Moral and ethical aspects.</subject><subject>Medicine -- Research -- Law and legislation -- Canada</subject><subject>Body, Human -- Law and legislation -- Canada</subject><title>Research with stored tissue samples of deceased persons : a North American perspective</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cj82k7815.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d217qq13n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sx61dm91n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis discusses the notion of tax evasion in Rwanda. It  looks at the role of tax administration and fiscal codes in Rwanda in the  implementation of tax anti-evasion measures in the country. The tax administration  and fiscal codes provide opportunities for the Rwandan people to realize a tax  evasion free society not only because of the tax administration departments in place  to curb tax evasion, the types of taxes, the measures of collection, but also the  reasonable fiscal procedure process in tax payment and also in allowing the taxpayer  participation in the tax assessment process, an essential component of co-operative  taxpayer attitudes for potential tax revenue collections to thrive. However, this thesis scrutinizes the reality in Rwanda for the  extent to which tax administration and tax laws have gone to achieve the goal of  curbing tax evasion. Tax administration measures and fiscal code provisions in place,  can not be said to be perfect as at times it is foreign ideas imported into Rwanda,  which must be adopted often as a conditionality to that much needed development  assistance. This in light of the persistent institutionalized corruption existing in  Rwanda, and the reality of public participation in the tax assessment process given  the Rwandan culture of evading taxes, makes the anti-evasion process inadequate in  Rwanda, thus further "watering down" the sufficiency of the tax law and  tax administration as a previously perceived usable strategy for curbing tax  evasion. The thesis argues therefore that the tax administration and fiscal codes in  curbing tax evasion are limited by existence of these realities unless modifications  are made in the implementation of measures against tax evasion in  Rwanda.</description><creator>Namubiru, Hadija Murangwa</creator><contributor>Friedlander, Lara (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Tax administration and procedure -- Rwanda</subject><subject>Tax evasion -- Rwanda</subject><title>Tax administration and the adequacy of fiscal codes in combatting tax evasion in Rwanda</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/td96k318d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sx61dm91n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4b29b667m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:52:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis offers a comparative analysis of the Constitutional  law mechanism for human rights protection in Canada and Russia. Russia is  experiencing a transition from the former soviet regime towards democracy and civil  society. Since the beginning of the transition in 1991 Russia has made three major  steps in that direction: the adoption of the Declaration of Rights and Freedoms of  the Individual and Citizen of 1991, the Constitution of 1993 and the ratification of  the European Convention on Human Rights in 1998. However, the existent  constitutional law mechanism for human rights protection is not fully effective due  to its novelty for Russian society. A number of lessons can be learned from the  Canadian and European experiences of human rights protection.
