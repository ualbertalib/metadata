Dietary treatments included: (1) negative control (CTL-, antibiotic free); (2) positive control (CTL+, 11 mg/kg virginiamycin); (3) MOS (diet 1 + Bio-Mos: 0.2% to 21 d and 0.1% thereafter); (4) LL (diet 1 + 1.25% Alcell lignin); (5) HL (diet 1 + 2.5% Alcell lignin). Bodyweight and feed conversion were not different when broilers were fed the CTL+, MOS, LL or HL diet. Birds fed MOS or LL had increased jejunum villi height (P &lt; 0.05) and greater goblet cell number per villus (P &lt; 0.05) when compared to those fed the CTL+ diet. MOS and LL increased (P &lt; 0.05) the cecal populations of Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria when compared to CTL+ fed birds. However, Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria loads were lowest (P &lt; 0.05) in birds fed the CTL+ or HL diet. Litter E. coli load was reduced (P &lt; 0.05) when birds were fed MOS than when fed the CTL+ diet, but comparable to LL or HL fed birds. In birds challenged with pathogenic strains of E. coli (O2 and O88 serotypes) and fed the MOS or HL diet, the cecal population of total E. coli was lower (P &lt; 0.05) than those fed the CTL+ diet; LL fed birds tended to have lower E. coli load than CTL+ fed birds. In summary, birds fed the MOS or LL diet had comparative advantage over CTL+ fed birds as evidenced by increased cecal populations of Lactobacilli and Bifdobacteria, increased villi height and greater goblet cell number in the jejunum, lower E. coli load in the litter, and lower cecal population of E. coli after an in vivo challenge with pathogenic strains of E. coli. Therefore, MOS and lignin could be regarded as natural alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters in poultry production. Key words.

Wave-type electric fish communicate by means of a continuous oscillatory electric signal produced by an electric organ. The electric organ discharges at frequencies which are sexually dimorphic in many species of electric fish. This dimorphism is thought to be attributed to female mate choice, although to date, there is no evidence for mate choice or intrasexual competition to have driven the evolution of this signaling dimorphism in wave-type electric fish. Here, I have tracked changes in body shape and electric organ discharge (EOD) frequency of A. leptorhynchus throughout a breeding conditioning period. I find that only females alter the shape of their bodies, presumably to account for increasing egg mass, during the breeding conditioning period. Throughout this period, both females and males do not alter their EOD frequencies significantly. Gravid females were used in an unforced preference test, where they were presented with two live, male A. leptorhynchus. Female preference was indicated by a passage of the female into one of the two male compartments. I find that females show a preference for higher EOD frequency males, while no preference is shown for longer, heavier or larger-amplitude males. Further investigations are needed to dissociate the role of EOD frequency from potentially correlated male traits, such as rate and type of modulations of EOD frequency. The finding of this study that female A. leptorhynchus prefer males of higher EOD frequency establishes wave-type weakly electric fish as a promising model system for the study of the evolution and the sensory mechanisms of female choice.</description><creator>Bargelletti, Olivia.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Brown ghost knifefish -- Sexual behavior.</subject><subject>Courtship in animals.</subject><subject>Sexual selection in animals.</subject><title>Mate preference in female weakly electric fish, Apteronotus leptorhynchus</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Olivia Bargelletti, 2007</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k643b538h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bv73c477j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1544bt56w</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Lie algebra associated to the lower central and p-central series of a group is an important invariant of the group but is difficult to compute.

Once considered as little more than a nuisance, antibiotic resistance has become a serious threat. The mortality rate for some infections is approaching that of the pre-antibiotic era. New antimicrobials are needed urgently. Prior to the introduction of any new antimicrobial, comprehensive toxicity and efficacy profiles are assessed in preclinical studies. This thesis focuses on two key stages of preclinical antimicrobial drug development, specifically compound screening in vitro and animal efficacy testing in vivo. We developed a sensitive colorimetric platform with high-throughput capacity for the rapid screening of candidate antimicrobials. This platform could be adapted to assess compounds targeting a range of bacteria, fungi (such as Candida albicans), and protozoan parasites (such as Leishmania major). When this assay was modified to measure minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for bacteria, 100% agreement within one dilution was achieved compared to the gold-standard method. A novel antifungal compound was taken forward to animal testing in an immunocompromised mouse model. We demonstrated herein that a histone deacetylase inhibitor in combination with an imidazole can synergise to produce a potent antifungal effect. A dose-dependent response, defined as a lower fungal burden and a higher survival rate, was achieved with increasing concentrations of the novel inhibitor.</description><creator>Lee, Bill.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Biology, Microbiology.</subject><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><title>Preclinical antimicrobial drug discovery : development and evaluation of a platform for high-throughput screening in vitro and an immunocompromised animal model</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Bill Lee, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cc08hk876.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/df65vc872</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3b591d37v</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The N-terminal 236 residues of Ssa4p, a hsp70 in budding yeast, are sufficient to target GFP to nuclei in ethanol-treated cells; this transport is mediated by the karyopherin-beta Nmd5p. Ssa4p(1-236)-GFP nuclear accumulation upon ethanol exposure depends on the cell surface sensors Wsc1p and Mid2p as well as protein kinase C, an activator of the cell integrity MAPK cascade. I have analyzed the distribution of Ssa4p(1-236)-GFP and Nmd5p-His6-HA in deletion mutants of the cell integrity MAPK cascade and demonstrate that this pathway controls ethanol-induced nuclear accumulation of Ssa4p(1-236)-GFP. Protein phosphorylation regulates protein trafficking, and I have studied this modification for Ssa4p(1-236)-GFP, Nmd5p and the nucleoporin Nsp1p. My results suggest that the phosphorylation status of Nmd5p may change when cells are treated with ethanol, and threonine was identified as the putative target residue(s) for modification. Furthermore, Snf1p kinase is required for stress-induced nuclear accumulation of Ssa4p(1-236)-GFP; my data are in line with the idea that Snf1p kinase phosphorylates a threonine residue present at a consensus Snf1p site in Nmd5p. In summary, my studies link the stress-induced nuclear accumulation of Ssa4p(1-236)-GFP to the cell integrity MAPK pathway and Snf1p kinase.</description><creator>Zhang, Rui, 1976-</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><title>Regulated nuclear import of the hsp70 Ssa4p upon ethanol stress in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Rui Zhang, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3t945w217.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3b591d37v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physiology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zg64tr16p</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study addresses a narrow but important facet of the war on terror: the interception of civil aircraft over the high seas without the consent of the state of registry, when such aircraft are suspected of transporting weapons of mass destruction or terrorists. It introduces the contemporary legal regime over the high seas, in particular the customary norms relating to freedom of overflight, jurisdiction over aircraft, and the 'Rules of the Air' adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The study also examines the legal status of military aircraft in international law as a symbol of a state's sovereignty. It explores the justifications for lawful interceptions as well as the legal obligation of states to show 'due regard' for the safety of civil air navigation. The ICAO standards for the interception of civil aircraft and their applicability to state aircraft are also discussed.

The majority of complete hydatidiform moles are sporadic and androgenetic; however, a rare subset has been identified which has a biparental genome. These have been found occasionally to recur in the same woman and, in multiple women in the same family suggesting a genetic defect. A maternal locus for biparental familial moles has been mapped to a 1.1Mb region on 19q13.4. Genotyping of a new family with multiple affected sisters has lead to the narrowing of this interval to 0.65Mb, which contains 30 genes. Screening of these genes led to the discovery of mutations in NALP7 in all affected individuals from four families of different ethnic origin. NALP7 is a member of a family of cytoplasmic proteins known to play a role in inflammation and the innate immune system.</description><creator>Murdoch, Sharlene.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Biology, Genetics.</subject><title>Identification of a gene responsible for recurrent familial hydatidiform moles</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Sharlene Murdoch, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h415pf79w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t722hf12v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Human Genetics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:d504rq57k</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Research in the field of dual diagnosis (the coexistence of symptoms indicative of a substance abuse problem and a mental health problem) has expanded immensely over the past 15 years. Unfortunately, much of the existing literature available on this topic is limited to adult populations. The researcher explored the rate of dual diagnosis in the adolescent population by conducting a secondary data analysis of the Canadian Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect (CIS-2003; Trocme et al., 2005). The rate of having one or more substance abuse problems in the CIS-2003 was 8.8% and the rate of having one or more mental health problems was 23.6%. Dual diagnosis was found to be under-reported in the child welfare system in Canada. Results of the secondary data analysis indicate that 4.4% of the total sample of adolescents aged between 10 and 15 years old had symptoms indicative of a dual diagnosis over the 3 month study period (n=4381). By providing a profile of child and caregiver characteristics and risk factors associated with dual diagnosis, clinicians from all realms can become better equipped to understand these issues. In the future, Social Workers and other professionals can work collaboratively on identification of DD and improving outcomes for youth and families affected by symptoms of a dual diagnosis.</description><creator>Shames, Linda.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Substance abuse -- Diagnosis -- Canada.</subject><subject>Mental illness -- Diagnosis -- Canada.</subject><subject>Social work with teenagers -- Canada.</subject><title>Rate of symptoms of dual diagnosis in the child welfare system in Canada : profile of adolescents and their caregiver in the CIS-2003</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Linda Shames, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zg64tr17z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d504rq57k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5h73q127k</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>For some Aboriginal people, healing is a relatively new word that seems to have emerged and taken on a life of its own only after the 1990 Mohawk Crisis and the ensuing Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (RCAP, 1996). In spite of the massive 4000-page RCAP report, some mainstream authorities (Brasfield, 2001) still believe that the meaning of Aboriginal healing has not been fully explained. In this study, an attempt will be made to widen the meaning of Aboriginal healing by examining ancient Haudenosaunee (People of the Longhouse) philosophy, historical cultural upheaval, and narratives from First Nations survivors of Indian residential schools and a Holocaust survivor. The results have shown a connection between Aboriginal healing and Canadian society. Healing can only occur if the wound is not continuously reopened such as when long-standing land claims remain unsettled, Indigenous language and culture programs are neglected, and a People are ignored.</description><creator>Loft, Michael.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Off-reservation boarding schools -- Canada.</subject><subject>Healing.</subject><subject>Indian children -- Abuse of -- Canada.</subject><title>Through our own eyes : a study of healing as elucidated by the narratives of First Nations individuals</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Michael Loft, 2007</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/76537535x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5h73q127k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5712mc13g</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Adaptation to vision impairment was studied by telephone interviews with 78 legally blind adults (mean age 79.5) who had received rehabilitation services from an agency in upstate New York. Data were collected on demographics, health, activity levels, social support, blindness data, adaptation to vision loss (AVL scale, Horwitz and Reinhardt, 2005), and symptoms of Charles Bonnet Syndrome (CBS). Using multiple regression and logistic regression, the most significant predictors of high AVL scores were found to be good interpersonal communication and a relative living close by, while predictors of CBS were self-reported health issues, especially diabetes, and fewer trips into the community. Very few respondents reported receiving any information on CBS from eye care providers. This suggests that doctors should consider discussing CBS with patients, and that both social workers and doctors need a better understanding of CBS, as symptoms could easily be mistaken for mental illness, causing inappropriate referrals.</description><creator>Knight, Lelia.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Hallucinations and illusions.</subject><subject>Vision disorders.</subject><title>Vision impairment in older adults : adaptation strategies and the Charles Bonnet syndrome</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Lelia Knight, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xw42nd18m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5712mc13g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nz806432j</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:08Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Social Work professionals are recognizing the problematic trend among young offenders who have a history of being cruel to animals. A sample of 118 files from a youth serving agency were examined to determine the potential relationships between demographics and background variables, selected items from the Child Behavior checklist (Achenbach, 1991), types of crimes and styles of aggression and animal cruelty. Reported styles of aggression consisted of proactive aggression (violent youth who planned their offences) and reactive aggression (youth who commit less serious crimes and would overreact to problems). In a stepwise regression analysis of a theoretical model, two significant predictors of cruelty toward animals were found: (1) the youths' history of proactive aggression and (2) youths' exposure to physical abuse, this latter both directly, and also as a significant predictor of proactive aggression. Further education and training for children, caregivers and professionals is needed to increase awareness of the link between animal cruelty and human violence.</description><creator>Merry, Erin K.

Recently explored multiple antenna or multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems have the potential of achieving large increases in wireless channel capacities and spectral efficiencies. However, powerful channel codes and sophisticated signal processing techniques are required to achieve these increases for low signal-to-noise ratios and in the presence of multipath fading. Motivated by the third generation wire-less standard and efforts towards fourth generation systems, this dissertation explores turbo-coded uplink transmission over Rayleigh faded MIMO channels, when channel state information is available only at the receiver (base-station). In this context, unlike previously proposed MIMO signal detection techniques of exponential or polynomial complexity, we first derive a novel soft-decision MIMO signal detector, which is of linear complexity in the number of transmit antennas, receive antennas and users. The proposed detector is integrated into a new iterative receiver for turbo-coded MIMO systems and simulation results are presented for various antenna configurations on slow, frequency non-selective Rayleigh fading channels. The explored MIMO systems achieve target bit error rate (BER) performance of 10-5 within 1.5 to 2.9 dB of the ergodic capacity limit in single and multi-user scenarios. Furthermore, system performance is shown to be robust to the effects of spatial correlation, channel estimation errors and imperfect power control. In addition, turbo-coded digital recording systems with multiple heads and tracks were considered as a further application of the proposed detector and iterative receiver. Good BER performance is achieved in these systems despite strong intertrack and intersymbol interference. Finally, we extend the union bound based method from turbo codes on the Gaussian noise channel to the proposed turbo-coded systems on wireless MIMO channels. Calculated bounds on BER performance are within 0.5 to 0.8 dB of the simulated results in the error floor region. In addition, a new performance analysis technique is proposed, which provides BER performance bounds within 0.1 to 0.5 dB of the simulated performance in the waterfall region. Furthermore, the latter technique can also provide accurate bounds for selected coded digital recording systems.</description><creator>Mysore, Naveen.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Turbo-coded MIMO systems : receiver design and performance analysis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Naveen Mysore, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20sz114.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/np193f08s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:70795d023</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:08Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Original contribution. A discussion of Carlo Lodoli's bi-fold understanding of indole (inherent nature); with respect to both meaning in architecture and the education of architects. Carlo Lodoli (1690--1761) exists as a footnote in most major history books of modern architecture. He is typically noted for either his influence on the Venetian Neoclassical tradition or as an early prophet to some sort of functionalism. Though I would not argue his influence, I doubt his role in the development of a structurally determined functionalism. The issue of influence is always present as very little of his writings have survived and his built work amounts to a few windowsills. He did, however, teach architecture. I propose to explore the pedagogic potential of Lodoli's lessons of architecture. Lodoli's teaching approach was not necessarily professional in that he did not instruct his students in the methods of drawing or construction techniques. Rather, his approach was dialogical. The topics were sweeping, often ethical, and ranged from the nature of truth to the nature of materials. Existing scholarship pertaining to Lodoli most often focuses upon his students' production of texts, projects, and projections. Andrea Memmo's Elementi dell'Architettura Lodoliana (1786, 1833) and Francesco Algarotti's Saggio sopra l'architettura (1756) are both specifically named by the respective authors as advancing Lodoli's architectural theories. Often overlooked are the apologues, or fables, used by Lodoli in lessons to his students. The main source for these fables is the Apologhi Immaginati (1787). Others were included in Memmo's Elementi. Apologues from both sources have been translated for the first time into English and can be found in Appendix I of the dissertation. I look specifically to these stories to understand and illustrate Lodoli's approach to making, teaching and thinking. This is understood through Lodoli's characterisation of the identity of materials and of the self. Within this dissertation I intend to flesh out the textual and architectural fabric surrounding the pedagogic activities of the Venetian Friar known as the Socrates of Architecture, Carlo Lodoli.</description><creator>Neveu, Marc J.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Architecture -- Study and teaching -- Italy -- Venice -- History.</subject><subject>Architecture -- Italy -- 18th century -- Philosophy.</subject><subject>Lodoli, Carlo, 1690-1761.</subject><title>Architectural lessons of Carlo Lodoli (1690-1761) : indole of material and of self</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Marc J.

In the first chapter, I examine a case study, John Coltrane's successive improvisations on "My Favorite Things," under two different theories in order to show how theories shape our view of the practices we are trying to explain. In the second chapter, I take up Coltrane's practices and their relations to theories once again but, in a reversal of the previous chapter's focus, I show how examining theories through practices can reveal these theory-practice gaps and problematic assumptions. I move, from there, to an analysis, informed by feminist standpoint epistemology, of the extent to which political values influence our theory choices and thus help construct our metaphysical views. Out of this discussion, my third chapter argues that attempts to universalize a culturally-situated notion of 'the musical work' (one drawn from Western classical music) do violence to works and artists situated in other cultural traditions. Thus I construct an alternative view of the musical work that I call 'contextualized nominalism' which has the merit of being sensitive to these issues of cultural situation. The fourth chapter explores connections between avant-garde jazz practices and oppositional politics which can be made visible when performances of works are accorded priority over composition. Here I construct a performative notion of community which, in addition to making the most sense of improvisational musical practices, can also be the ground of an 'ethos of improvisation' extendable into other social contexts. Finally I turn to the need for a pluralistic framework in aesthetic evaluation of polycultural artistic processes and products, through a critical examination of universal notions of aesthetic value. I argue, from this and all of the preceding chapters, that where we cross cultures, or mix them, in aesthetic evaluations, we must do so as respectful pluralists and within a pluralist framework.</description><creator>Nicholls, Tracey.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Avant-garde (Music)</subject><subject>Aesthetics.</subject><title>It does too matter : aesthetic value(s), avant-garde art, and problems of theory choice</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Tracey Nicholls, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qj72pc45w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z029p894s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Philosophy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:r207tt43r</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The nature of protein-protein interactions was explored through the design of polypeptide ligands targeting specifically human a-thrombin. Design strategies ranged from isolation of binding fragments from natural proteins, conformational stabilization using structural scaffold, to bivalent linkage of library-selected components. The interaction of thrombin with a 28-residue polypeptide from the sixth-epidermal growth factor-like repeat of human thrombomodulin (hTM-EGF6) was characterized in solution by use of NMR spectroscopy. The thrombin-binding region was identified and the thrombin-bound structure of the binding region was determined. The thrombin-bound structure of this fragment of thrombomodulin was then used as a basis for the design of peptide ligands with potentially enhanced thrombin-binding activities. Attempts for affinity enhancement through conformational stabilization by structure-based methods exemplified the need for alternative approaches that exploit the ubiquitous weak molecular interactions. Bivalent ligands of thrombin were constructed via linkage of natural protein fragments. It was found that bivalent effects can be afforded by the proper linkage of the individually weak binding moieties. The bivalent designs were further generalized to include linkage of novel polypeptides selected from combinatorial libraries as individual binding components. These novel bivalent ligands targeting both the active site and the exosite I of thrombin exhibited up to 110-fold enhancement of binding activity. The present study renews the interests in weak protein-protein/polypeptide interactions and their use in protein biochemistry. The design of thrombin-targeting bivalent ligands from weakly-binding moieties highlights the nature of bivalent molecular interactions, emphasizing the synergistic interplay between the two binding sites conferred by linker residues with a proper covalent geometry. It also illustrates that bivalent/multivalent binding can be applied as a general and practical approach for the design of high-affinity inhibitors targeting discrete sites on functionally important proteins, especially those involved in biological and cell signaling processes.</description><creator>Ng, Yin Dick Andy, 1974-</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><title>Exploring the nature of protein-protein interactions through the design of bivalent miniproteins that bind and inhibit human thrombin</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Yin Dick Andy Ng, 2005</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7h149t85r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r207tt43r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:w3763c09x</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This inquiry explores six Korean students' personal narratives about their living and learning experiences in their study abroad contexts. My goal is to examine the relationships between learner agency and symbolic power embedded in these six students' second language (L2) sociocultural contexts such as school, home and communities. The theoretical framework is derived primarily from Vygotskian sociocultural theory, Bakhtinian dialogic theory, and Bourdieuian critical approach to language practices. Drawing on an interpretive qualitative approach, I examine social, cultural, historical and political forces that influence the ways these students perceive, evaluate and negotiate their challenges and struggles in their social worlds. In a conventional approach to language studies, students are often seen as passive objects to be controlled by task instructions provided by classroom teachers. A growing number of L2 researchers challenge the artificial distinction between language learners and their social worlds. They emphasize that L2 learning should go far beyond mastery of vocabulary and syntax. However, over-simplified understanding of sociocultural influences on L2 practices can stereotype L2 students from the same cultural background assuming they share similar knowledge, beliefs and values. A reductionistic stance of culture has the danger of neglecting the complexity of L2 individuals' different voices and meaning-making processes. I argue that these L2 learners are far more complex than just 'ESL students' or 'non-native speakers'. I collected the participants' narratives for a six-month period primarily through open-ended interviews, including a variety of documentation such as samples of course work, personal notes, emails, and field notes. The analyses of the data suggests that although all six participants share certain commonalities such as being Korean and being educated in a Korean national educational system, they are quite diverse in the challenges they experience and types of symbolic power they perceive, evaluate and negotiate in their different social worlds. While engaging in various L2 literacy practices, they were consciously crossing different social spaces, taking different positionings, and negotiating among multiple beliefs, values and meanings about social relations of power. Their agency to negotiate the complex social relations of power manifests in the ways they invest in achieving different forms of capital, such as 'cheong' relationships as social capital and searching for meaning in life as spiritual capital. The data implies that L2 students are complex yet active social agents. Thus, these students' struggles in their L2 learning processes should be conceived as a complex process of exercising learner agency in their multiple social worlds, rather than be attributed only to cognitive capability or lack of motivation.</description><creator>Lee, Heekyeong, 1971-</creator><date>2005</date><subject>English language -- Study and teaching -- Korean speakers.</subject><title>A socio-cultural-historical analysis of six Korean students' experiences in L2 learning contexts : learner agency and symbolic power</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Heekyeong Lee, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4t64gs43x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w3763c09x</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Second Language Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:70795d03c</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is about "authentic learning": learning from life-like contexts. The construct derived from the social situated approach (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991), has surprisingly no counterpart in cognitive psychology. The first objective of this thesis is to develop a cognitive formulation of authentic learning from classical cognitive works and recent neuroscience studies findings. The characteristically cognitive feature posited is "n-coding", the encoding of multimodal input (verbal, visual, kinesthetic, social...). To test quasi-experimentally the effectiveness of this cognitive definition, a review of the instructional literature identified Collaborative Group Problem Solving (Heller et al., 1992) as an appropriate candidate for authentic instruction in physics. The study design was comprised of one control and three treatment conditions varying in degrees of n-coding: (high, medium and low) while controlling for each treatment group's "participatory framework". All students were assessed before and after instruction on the FCI (Hestenes et al., 1992). Confidence levels were measured with each FCI question resulting in four new measures (gain in mean: confidence, right answer confidence, wrong answer confidence and weighted FCI). Procedural problem solving skills were measured through final exam grades. Two empirical questions are posed. First, does increasing n-coding enhance learning? Second, since cognitive n-coding is unaccountable from the social perspective, does the situated perspective "subsume" the cognitive (Greeno, 1998)? Here, a quasi-experiment was not only used to test interventions but paradigm effectiveness, a methodological first. Results shows that high and medium n-coding groups were significantly more effective than the situated low n-coding group (p=0.003) showing the effectiveness of increasing n-coding and refuting the claim that social approaches must subsume cognitive ones. No significant difference was found between high and medium n-coding groups (p=0.74) whereas all treatment groups differed from the control (p=0.0497), replicating findings on the effectiveness of non-traditional instruction (Hake, 1998). Competing cognitive and social perspectives (Schoenfeld, 1999) may be better replaced by cross-paradigm symbioses such as importing authentic learning from situated approach into cognition. A model for reflecting on cross-scale symbioses is developed through the presence of self-similar patterns across scales (from micro-cognitive to macro-social). The fractal is put forward as a metaphor for the field of education and may serve to unify paradigms and yield optimal pictures of learning.</description><creator>Lasry, Nathaniel.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Problem solving.</subject><subject>Learning.</subject><title>Understanding authentic learning : a quasi-experimental test of learning paradigms</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Nathaniel Lasry, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k3569844d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/70795d03c</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2r36v2772</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A fundamental problem in interprocedural program analyses is the need to represent and manipulate collections of large sets. Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) are a data structure widely used in model checking to compactly encode large state sets. In this dissertation, we develop new techniques and frameworks for applying BDDs to program analysis, and use our BDD-based analyses to gain new insight into factors influencing analysis precision. To make it feasible to express complicated, interrelated analyses using BDDs, we first present the design and implementation of JEDD, a Java language extension which adds relations implemented with BDDs as a datatype, and makes it possible to express BDD-based algorithms at a higher level than existing BDD libraries. Using JEDD, we develop PADDLE, a framework of context-sensitive points-to and call graph analyses for Java, as well as client analyses that make use of their results. PADDLE supports several variations of context-sensitive analyses, including the use of call site strings and abstract receiver object strings as abstractions of context. We use the PADDLE framework to perform an in-depth empirical study of the effect of context-sensitivity variations on the precision of interprocedural program analyses. The use of BDDs enables us to compare context-sensitive analyses on much larger, more realistic benchmarks than has been possible with traditional analysis implementations. Finally, based on the call graph computed by PADDLE, we implement, using JEDD, a novel static analysis of the cflow construct in the aspect-oriented language AspectJ. Thanks to the JEDD high-level representation, the implementation of the analysis closely mirrors its specification.</description><creator>Lhoták, Ondřej.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Program analysis using binary decision diagrams</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Ondřej Lhoták, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1j92gc47x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36v2772</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qr46r522b</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>My dissertation takes the social and symbolic location of women---the inner chambers [guige or gui]---as a point of departure to examine Ming-Qing women's unique approach to the writing of poetry. In Ming-Qing China, women continued to be assigned to the inner, domestic sphere by Confucian social and gender norms. The inner chambers were not only a physically and socially bounded space within which women were supposed to live, but also a discursive site for the construction of femininity in both ideological and literary discourses. The term gui embraces a nexus of meanings: the material frame of the women's chambers; a defining social boundary of women's roles and place; and a conventional topos evoking feminine beauty and pathos in literary imagination. Working with the literary context of boudoir poetics, yet also considering other indispensable levels of meanings epitomized in the cultural signifier guige, my dissertation demonstrates how Ming-Qing women poets re-conceive the boudoir as a distinctive textual territory encoded with their subjective perspectives and experiences. Compared with the poetic convention, the boudoir as inscribed in Ming-Qing women's texts is far more complex as its depiction is informed by nuances in their historical, social and individual experiences.</description><creator>Li, Xiaorong, 1969-</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Chinese poetry -- Women authors -- History and criticism.</subject><subject>Chinese poetry -- Ming dynasty, 1368-1644.</subject><subject>Women poets, Chinese.</subject><subject>Chinese poetry -- Qing dynasty, 1644-1912.</subject><title>Rewriting the inner chambers : the boudoir in Ming-Qing women's poetry</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Xiaorong Li, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cc08hk88g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qr46r522b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of East Asian Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xw42nd19w</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Under what circumstances does foreign donor assistance during war-to-peace transitions contribute to the strengthening of civil society and the deepening of democracy? I answer this question through a comparative study of civil society development in the Palestinian territories and El Salvador, where I conducted 130 interviews with directors of donor agencies, grassroots activists, and directors of NGOs. Divergent civil society developments in the Palestinian territories and El Salvador after the signing of peace accords in the early 1990s present a real puzzle given the pre-accord similarities in civil society organization between the two cases. Both the Palestinian territories and El Salvador had a legacy of rich, vibrant grassroots organization and civil society activity during their protracted conflicts. In both settings, grassroots organizations have played central roles in non-violent resistance, consciousness-raising, and the provision of community services. Moreover, after the initiation of the peace processes in both the Palestinian territories and El Salvador, foreign donors provided substantial assistance to civil society groups. However, their civil society developmental paths diverged sharply during the war-to-peace transition. In the Palestinian territories, existing civil society organizations have engaged less actively with their previous grassroots constituencies since the start of the war-to-peace transition, and the number of grassroots-based civil society organizations has decreased. Moreover, many of these organizations have been limited in their access to institutions that engage the state. In El Salvador, the re-constitution of civil society has led to its broad access to institutions that engage the state and to higher levels of grassroots inclusion in the political transformation process. I argue that these divergent outcomes in the Palestinian territories and El Salvador reflect the differential effects that foreign assistance has on civil society after more or less inclusive political settlements. I find that in cases like the Palestinian territories, where the political settlement excludes important socio-political groups, foreign donor assistance is less likely to contribute to the strengthening of civil society or the deepening of democracy. Rather, foreign donor assistance to civil society is more likely to exacerbate political polarization and weaken civil society by further privileging those select groups already favored by the terms of the non-inclusive settlement. Conversely, after more inclusive political settlements like in El Salvador, foreign donor assistance can play a more constructive role in developing civil society and contributing to the deepening of democracy by encouraging grassroots organization, and expanding access to political institutions that engage the state.</description><creator>Jamal, Manal.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Gaza Strip -- Economic conditions.</subject><subject>Economic assistance -- Gaza Strip.</subject><subject>Economic assistance -- El Salvador.</subject><subject>El Salvador -- Economic conditions.</subject><subject>Economic assistance -- West Bank.</subject><subject>West Bank -- Economic conditions.</subject><title>After the 'peace processes' : foreign donor assistance and the political economy of marginalization in Palestine and El Salvador</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Manal Jamal, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9g54xn93x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xw42nd19w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2514nq57t</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Melodrama is a popular mode of address that privileges affect at the expense of reflection and critique. Generally held in disrepute, melodrama's simplicity and sensationalism are widely read as a sign of social and psychological alienation. Melodrama responds to its critics, however, with ever-renewed and self-assured appeals to affect itself. Melodrama's irreducible privilege of affect in mind, therefore, the thesis proposes that affect admits description in Levinasian terms as a "radical passivity." The Levinasian proposal on affect, moreover, is extended to a theory of cinema, which, it is shown, is particularly well suited to melodramatic expression. Affect or "embodied passivity," Levinas explains, is irreducible to phenomenological notions of intentionality, psychoanalytic conceptions of psychic investment or cognitive appraisals of psychic processing. To be a body is to be exposed to wounding but it is also a naIve agreement to the conditions of its sustentation. To be a body, in short, is to be capable of being affected. For Levinas this passive relation to what is other is the condition of an ethical responsibility that is absolute. Levinas's notion of embodied passivity, however, has aesthetic implications about which he was deeply ambiguous. Hence it is in the context of an aesthetics of embodied passivity, largely unexplored by Levinas, that the thesis examines melodrama's focus on affect and the specifically cinematic expressions of embodied passivity. Melodrama's accessible address, however, reduces the Other, as Levinas would say, to caricatures, mobilizes affect in the direction of a "monopathic" response and disavows, in the process, the encounter with alterity to which it appeals. Nonetheless melodrama "fleshes out the cliche" or exploits the stereotype in the service of having, precisely, some affect. Such is the melodramatic privilege of enlivenment over the circumstances of its orchestration. Hence it is possible to appraise melodrama's heightened orchestrations of style, its recourse to emphasis and its enduring appeals to suffering and happiness, as prevailing testimony to the (unspeakable) nature of the body's irreducible vulnerability. Melodrama's elemental if simplistic vision is that affect matters absolutely.</description><creator>Hunting, John.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Melodrama in motion pictures.</subject><subject>Passivity (Psychology)</subject><title>Affect, melodrama and cinema : as essay on embodied passivity</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© John Hunting, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9z903425c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2514nq57t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2b88qh44g</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this study of narration, feminist theory, and grotesque Canadian fiction, my aim is to provide a narrative model with which to read characters portrayed as both female and monstrous in a way that criticism on the grotesque does not. I provide two systems for the methodology of this study: via negativa, a well-established philosophical system of definition by negation, which shows the strength of the grotesque to represent a subject that is inherently paradoxical; and a narrative model called the "middle voice," which I developed to examine narratives that confuse or render ambiguous the identity of subjects. Through these distinct but complementary frameworks I illustrate a literary phenomenon in fiction of the grotesque: that authors develop and reveal the subjectivity of characters by confounding identities. Although I provide a concise definition of the term "grotesque," my focus is on feminist theoretical approaches to the grotesque. However, whereas feminist theory on the grotesque examines the binary opposition of woman to man, this study shows that the grotesque bypasses the "male/female" dichotomy in the representation of fictional characters. Instead, the sustained contradiction of the central opposition "woman/monster" works to undermine the notion of fictional characterization. Specifically, this study focuses on the grotesque as a narrative strategy and examines the use of the grotesque in the portrayal of female narrators. The prevalence of female grotesque characters in recent Canadian fiction combined with the rapid growth of interest in the critical concept of the "female grotesque" requires a theoretical analysis of the literature. In the fiction I examine by Canadian authors Margaret Atwood, Lynn Coady, Barbara Gowdy, Alice Munro, and Miriam Toews, narrators are contradictory. As subjects, they have doubled identities. Authors situate identity ("subjectivity") in the realm of paradox, rather than in the realm of clarity and resolution. As a result, readers and critics must rely on ambiguity and subversion as guides when posing the ultimately irresolvable question "who is speaking?" Through analysis of this fiction, then, I argue for nothing short of a new conceptualization of subjectivity.</description><creator>Hutchison, Lorna.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Canadian fiction -- 20th century -- History and criticism.</subject><subject>Grotesque in literature.</subject><subject>Women in literature.</subject><title>Strategies of the grotesque in Canadian fiction</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Lorna Hutchison, 2005</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kd17cz55r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2b88qh44g</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q524jt023</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause a chronic lung infection in individuals with cystic fibrosis. The O antigen of lipopolysaccharide is a major virulence factor for Gram-negative bacteria and plays a critical role in bacterium-host interactions. The inhibition of O antigen biosynthesis is known to significantly reduce the virulence of P. aeruginosa. The O antigen biosynthetic enzymes are considered as promising novel targets to develop new antimicrobials to treat a P. aeruginosa infection. WbpP and WbpM are two UDP-GlcNAc-modifying enzymes that are involved in the initial steps of the O-antigen biosynthesis in P. aeruginosa serotype 06. WbpP is a UDP-GlcNAc 4-epimerase that preferentially catalyzes the conversion of acetylated substrates over non-acetylated substrates, such as UDP-Glc. In contrast, WbpM is a membrane protein with a catalytic domain that is capable of UDP-GlcNAc 4,6-dehydratase activity. The structural and biological studies were pursued to gain insight into the mechanism of action for WbpP and WbpM. Specifically for WbpP, the crystal structures of this enzyme in complex with cofactor and either UDP-Glc or UDP-GalNAc were determined at 2.5 and 2.1 A, respectively. These represent the first structural studies of a genuine UDP-GlcNAc 4-epimerase. For WbpM, crystallographic studies proved difficult. Hence, the crystal structures of FlaA1, a close soluble relative from Helicobacter pylori, were determined in the presence of substrate, inhibitors and bound cofactor, with resolutions ranging from 2.8-1.9 A. These represent the first structural studies of a 4,6-dehydratase that can catalyze a UDP-hexose. Third, the crystal structures of the Y141M FlaA1 mutant were determined in oxidized and reduced forms at 2.2 and 2.1 A, respectively, to study the structure of an unusual T-M-K triad found in WbpM. Finally, a homology model of the catalytic domain of WbpM was built based on the structures of FlaA1 wild type and mutant to unveil its unique structural features. In conclusion, the work described in this thesis gives insight into the structures and reaction mechanisms of WbpP and WbpM and provide a basis for future studies aimed at understanding the O antigen biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa.</description><creator>Ishiyama, Noboru.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><title>Structural studies of the O antigen biosynthetic enzymes from Pseudomonas aeruginosa</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Noboru Ishiyama, 2005</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8g84mr610.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q524jt023</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0r9677793</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study integrates the research on the social construction of motherhood as it applies to mothers of children with special needs. More specifically, it, looks at how writings by these mothers can (a) help them cope with the emotional ramifications of having such a child, (b) contribute to the knowledge base of professionals who deal with and nurture not only children with special needs but also their mothers, and (c) constitute an effective qualitative research tool. The study focuses on the relationship between writing processes and products and the development of mothers' emotional states and emotional development, their self-image, self-confidence, role identity, and comfort. It investigates feelings of inadequacy, guilt, anger, and frustration, especially those engendered by good mother/bad mother social judgments, to which mothers of children with special needs are particularly vulnerable. I came to this area of research organically---as a clinician, as a teacher, and as a mother of a child with special needs myself. Van Manan (1990) suggests there is no better way to understand a phenomenon than to live it. I realized I was uniquely positioned to understand, examine, and synthesize the therapeutic effects of mothers' writing, reading, and storytelling, and understand the social environment that fuels it. As a clinician and educator, I also recognized its value as a rich, yet relatively unexplored, source of knowledge. In preparation for designing the study, I looked beyond peer-reviewed literature to popular literature, including diaries and autobiographies of mothers, to familiarize myself with their writings and the impact of such writings on the mothers' emotional adjustments, including their need for expression, support, and advocacy---for themselves and others. The study describes the experiences of a writing group (eight participants) comprised of mothers of children with special needs. The group met weekly for ten weeks to examine and share their feelings and life stories through a series of written assignments. Common themes and individual responses to this experience were captured anecdotally throughout the sessions, as well as in pre- and post-group interviews. Following a description of how the study evolved, coinciding with my personal shift from quantitative to qualitative researcher, I begin with a comprehensive review of mothering as a research area in literature, and a review of literature on the therapeutic effects of reading, writing and storytelling. I then discuss the methodology of this study with an emphasis on the literature on focus groups, memory work, narratives and writing, as well as qualitative research tools and techniques. The results of the study are presented descriptively using primarily a narrative approach, including a more detailed analysis of the experiences of four mothers who participated in the study. All the mothers reported beneficial effects from their participation. They felt empowered by the experience and inspired to continue to use writing, not only for its individual therapeutic effect but also as a means to advocate and inform others. The connection between writing and advocacy was a recurrent theme that emerged from the study---a strong common desire to help others, and the recognition that writing was an effective means to accomplish the mothers' goal to have professionals understand them better, individually and as a whole, and to be more empathetic. Other findings include the incongruence of thought between mothers and professionals, and the need to deepen our understanding of parent-professional interaction; and how much more impact the mothering debate has on mothers of children with special needs, particularly the stay-at-home versus working mothers' argument. This study provides insight into the extensive thoughts and emotions experienced by these mothers, and furthers our understanding of themes like stages of mourning for the not-so-perfect child, and the inter-related processes of storytelling, reading, and writing. It also has implications in the field of memory work, looking at how these mothers recalled early events in the lives of their children and how they remembered their experience in the study, months after its conclusion. Finally, it discusses the implications of using therapeutic writing as a qualitative research tool. The study concludes with suggestions for using writing to facilitate communication and understanding between parents and educators as well as between parents and other professionals, for their mutual benefit.</description><creator>Greenstone, Harriet.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Creative writing -- Therapeutic use.</subject><subject>Parents of children with disabilities.</subject><subject>Parents of exceptional children.</subject><title>Mother writes : writing as therapy for mothers of children with special needs</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Harriet Greenstone, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7h149t88k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0r9677793</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Curriculum and Instruction</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9880vw23p</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:12:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The articles presented in this thesis examined issues of identification and perception of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in a sample of 38 boys with ADHD and 43 comparison boys without ADHD. The boys were recruited from local schools in the Montreal area as well as through the community. In Article 1, the positive illusory bias was explored in the area of attention using two different tasks in order to improve our understanding of the self-perceptions of boys with ADHD. Some evidence for positive illusions was found in that boys with ADHD estimated performance at the same level as the comparison group despite performing significantly worse. Additionally, on the Conners' Continuous Performance Test-II (C-CPT-II), significantly more boys with ADHD overestimated their performance than comparison boys. However, because the majority of the boys underestimated their performance, it is suggested that in unfamiliar situations boys with ADHD do not exhibit positive illusions to the same extent as in familiar situations. In Article 2, the perceptions of ADHD reported by others were examined in relation to an objective measure of attention. Through this, the validity of the C-CPT-II was also examined. Parent and teacher ratings of boys with ADHD were compared to boys' performance on the C-CPT-II. Parents completed the Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised (CPRS-R) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and teachers completed the Conners' Teacher Rating Scale-Revised (CTRS-R). While both parent and teacher ratings on the CPRS-R and the CTRS-R respectively showed significant correlations with performance, teachers' ratings had the highest correlations with the errors of the C-CPT-II. Only the externalizing total T score rating on the CBCL was correlated with performance on the C-CPT-II. Additionally, boys with ADHD performed significantly more poorly than comparison boys on the C-CPT-II. However, there was no significant difference between the performance of boys with ADHD and boys with learning disabilities or between boys with learning disabilities and comparison boys. Using discriminate function analysis, the C-CPT-II was able to correctly classify 72% of the participants into either an ADHD or comparison group. The final discussion centres on this research programme's contribution to the field.</description><creator>Glen, Tamara.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Self-perception.</subject><subject>Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.</subject><title>Exploring perceptions of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Tamara Glen, 2005</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xk81jq83x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9880vw23p</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):41825</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
