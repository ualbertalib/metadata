Doses of chlorpromazine, too small to markedly affect escape from noxious stimulation, suppress or prevent the occurrence of a trained avoidance response. But phenobarbital, even at ataxic doses, does not produce this decrement. An investigation of this difference might not only elucidate the modes of action of these drugs, but might also throw some light on the mechanisms involved in the avoidance response.</description><creator>Posluns, Donald.</creator><contributor>Bindra, D.

This property of cortical cells was suggested by the fact that many responses to electrical stimulation of the cerebral cortex could be accounted for by the presence of such differentially-repolarizing cells in the cortex. Of these responses the paroxysmal or epileptiform afterdischarge caused by strong repetitive stimulation of the cerebral cortex seemed a likely candidate for investigation.</description><creator>Pinsky, Carl.</creator><contributor>Burns, B.

The high temperatures sought in the experiments were produced by heat released from exothermic reactions. Two such reactions were used, that of thermite and that of silicon-ferric oxide. Thermite is a mixture of aluminum and iron oxide. Ferric oxide was used in the experiments because its reaction with aluminum releases more heat per gram of reactants than do those of ferrous oxide or magnetite. For complete reaction, the mixture should contain 54 parts of aluminum and 159.7 parts of ferric oxide by weight.</description><creator>Philpotts, John. A.</creator><contributor>Saull, V.

The basic principles of Plastic Design are presented, illustrating the formation of plastic ''hinges", and their rotational properties. The beam line method for semi- rigid connections, originated by C. Batho, is shown, and a theory presented using this beam line to find the required semi- rigid connection which will transfer the hinge rotation from the beam to the connection. Experiments are described in which this theory was verified. Two connections were tested to obtain their moment-rotation characteristics. Then two statically indeterminate structures using the same types of connections were tested to demonstrate that all plastic hinges formed at the same load. Finally, the advantages of this method are discussed.</description><creator>Nitkin, Irving. M.</creator><contributor>De Stein, J.

If students are to write successfully in school or in later life, they must learn to spell correctly the necessary words of their language.

But any sermon involves more than these things: it involves the success or failure as communicated in preaching; and it involves the approach to the difficulties or sermon conventions. These cannot be entirely separated from the main study, but they will be taken for granted from time to time.</description><creator>Napier, Murray. P.</creator><contributor>Heuser, A.

It turned the page in the history of the development of the N. U. It represented a breaking point in the tradition of the movement which had been held for a quarter of a century. The N.U., until then purely a social, educational and religious Islamic movement, now became also a political party. It now became itself like a miniature structure of Islam which embraces every aspect of Life.</description><creator>Naim, Mochtar.</creator><contributor>Rasjidi, M.

Phrased in another fashion, this inquiry concerns the authenticity and meaning of Mark 4:11-12. In reality there are two questions, but the latter grows out of the former if the former receives an affirmative answer. Even if the question about authenticity were to receive a negative answer, the investigator would find it necessary to account for the saying, its meaning, and intention, though of course these would not then be ascribed to Jesus.</description><creator>Myers, William.

W. T. The seismic investigations were a part of a continuing, comprehensive, Arctic research program directed by the Polar Continental Shelf Project (P.C.S.P.). The P.C.S.P. was created by a Federal Cabinet directive in 1959 and is a division of the Department of Mines and Technical Surveys. The seismic operations in the summer of 1960 were of a preliminary and reconnaissance nature designed to measure the thickness of the sedimentary section in as many localities as possible and to lay the foundations for detailed investigations in following years.</description><creator>Morrison, Huntly.

Furthermore, it has been shown that estrogen induces great increases in the serum lipid. This increase in large measure represents an increase in phospholipid and it is associated with an increase in serum phosphoprotein, which is also evoked by estrogen. It is further known that estrogen induces great increases in the level of the serum calcium especially of the non-diffusible traction.</description><creator>Moo-Young, Alfred.

This is done within the framework of a static, cut-off theory. It is round that this potential corresponds to that which would be obtained by an appropriate selection of terms in the Brillouin-Wigner perturbation series solution. The transcendental equation for the potential thus formed is then solved exactly; and this is compared with the one-meson- exchange potential of ordinary perturbation theory.</description><creator>Month, Melvin.</creator><contributor>Sharp, R.
