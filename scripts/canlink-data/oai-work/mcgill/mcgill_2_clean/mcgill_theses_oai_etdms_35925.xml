epilimnetic plankton communities. Although the hypothesis is true for oligotrophic lakes, biomass increases between successive size classes in mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes. The abundance of organisms in logarithmic size intervals is strongly negatively correlated with size. The relationship between organism size and physiological performance in mixed communities was examined by testing the hypothesis that limnoplankton respiration rates are predictable functions of mean body size. The equation governing this relationship was found to be similar to those obtained with laboratory cultures. The total epilimnetic phosphorus concentration is correlated with both biovolume and respiration rate. Many limnological relationships, including those established in this thesis, are based on linear regressions between log-transformed variables. The rules for the correct use of backtransformed predictions are elucidated. A theorem is proven, which sets limits to the relationship between the coefficients of determination on the original and transformed scales. Simulated data and empirical results are used to illustrate the applications and limitations of the theoretical results.</description><creator>Ahrens, M.

The adamantane derivatives, 1-bromoadamantane (1-C$ sb{10}$H$ sb{15}$Br) and 2-chloroadamantane (2-C$ sb{10}$H$ sb{15}$Cl) were found to have two phase transitions, at 283 K and 312 K for the former and 227 K and 242 K for the latter; 2-bromoadamantane (2-C$ sb{10}$H$ sb{15}$Br) and 1-chloroadamantane (1-C$ sb{10}$H$ sb{15}$Cl) only exhibited one phase transition each, at 281 K and 245 K, respectively. Only one phase transition was found for 9-bicyclononanone (9-C$ sb9$H$ sb{14}$O) at 299 K. Oxanorbornane (C$ sb6$H$ sb{10}$O), a liquid, was found to have three phase transformations (192, 234, and 245 K), with the 234 K transition being metastable. Another phase transition, which is both time dependent and rate-of-cooling dependent, was found for o-carborane (o-C$ sb2$B$ sb{10}$H$ sb{12}$) by variable-temperature infrared spectroscopy. The infrared and Raman spectra of the adamantane derivative, 2-adamantanone (2-C$ sb{10}$H$ sb{14}$O), revealed that a new low-temperature phase was present after cycling. Micro-Raman pressure spectroscopy was used for the first time in the study of phase transitions of plastic crystals. The same phase transformation of 1-chloroadamantane that occurred at 245 K and 1.01 bar was found to occur at 295 K and $ sim$5 kbar. The o-carborane phase transition which took place at 274 K and 1.01 bar also takes place at 295 K and $ sim$10 kbar. Finally, 2-chloroadamantane, which exhibited two phase transitions (227 K and 242 K) at atmospheric pressure, also underwent phase transformations at room temperature and 3 and 11 kbar, respectively.</description><creator>Paroli, Ralph Michaël</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Chemistry, Inorganic.</subject><title>Studies of orientationally-disordered organic and inorganic molecular solids</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rx913q554.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1g05fc295</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ks65hc89r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Codes for the calculation of magnetic field distributions in two and three dimensions are now widely available; however, they generally do not permit to account for phenomena such as hysteresis remanence and anisotropy. The modeling of these phenomena is important in the design of power devices and essential in magnetic recording technology. In this thesis, magneto-statics is formulated without making any superfluous assumption about the constitutive relation. The nature of the relation between M and H is thoroughly discussed and computationally tractable models of this same relation are critically examined. The difficulties inherent to the application of the finite element method in conjunction with the utilization of these models are discussed. An experimental finite element code has been developed and validated with two test problems.</description><creator>Ostiguy, Jean-François</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Finite elements for magnetic fields in hysteretic media</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k643b197v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hc89r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:c534fp61p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Spin dynamics in pulsed Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy are studied theoretically using spin density operator formulation. The theory exploits the use of irreducible spherical tensor (multipole) operators of spin angular momentum in developing alternative treatments to spin dynamical problems. Applications in spin decoupling and soft pulse dynamics are considered, giving new analytical solutions for the complete density matrix. The focus of the thesis, however, is on the development of two distinctly new methods of solution to the quantum Liouville equation for NMR field modulation. The first method derives a linear integral equation for the magnetization and provides a rapidly converging integral series solution which is useful in explaining many pulse shapes. The second method uses the Wei-Norman Lie algebra approach$ sp{ rm 96}$ which reduces the complete arbitrary spin I problem to a Riccati equation. Novel exact analytical solutions for a class of temporal field modulations are obtained. In contrast to all other existing formulations, the theory provides the first known examples of exactly soluble nonrectangular pulse shapes for all resonance off-set, all field amplitudes, all time and valid for all spin I $ geq$ 1/2. In addition, a new series expansion for the complete spin density matrix is obtained. The theory is applied to producing spin inversion profiles which show applicability to selective excitation.</description><creator>Campolieti, Giuseppe.</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Chemistry, Physical.</subject><title>Quantum theoretical investigations of field modulation and spin dynamics in NMRNQR</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fj2362709.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fp61p</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x059c8228</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Speaker-independence and large lexicon access are still two of the greatest problems in automatic speech recognition. Cognitive and information-theory approaches try to solve the recognition problem by proceeding in almost opposite directions. The former rely on knowledge representation, reasoning and perceptual analysis, while the latter is in general based on highly numerical and mathematical algorithms. Progress arises from the integration of the two mentioned approaches. Artificial intelligence techniques are often used in the cognitive approach, but these techniques usually lack sophisticated numerical support. The Extended Procedural Network constitutes a general AI framework which supports powerful numerical strategies which include stochastic techniques. The model has been tested on difficult problems in speech recognition, including speaker-independent letter and digit recognition, speaker-independent vowel and diphthong recognition, and access to a large lexicon. Various experiments and comparisons have been run on a large number of speakers and the results are reported. A discussion of further research advancements and investigations is provided.</description><creator>Merlo, Ettore</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Artificial Intelligence.</subject><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>An artificial intelligence language to describe extended procedural networks /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6t053g794.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x059c8228</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fn106z81w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is concerned with the distributional problems related to quadratic forms in normal variables.

We hypothesized that prostanoids not only exhibit cerebral vasoactive properties, but also play an important role in setting the limits of autoregulation of CBF in the newborn. Consequently, in the newborn piglet, we determined the effects of prostaglandins (PGs), PGE$ sb1$, PGE$ sb2$, PGF$ sb{2 alpha}$ and PGI$ sb2$, on CBF, and compared their vasoactive action on isolated internal carotid and basilar arteries of newborns and adults. Cerebrovascular prostanoid concentrations were also measured as a function of systemic blood pressure (BP), in animals subjected or not to prostanoid synthesis inhibition, using ibuprofen. Finally, we examined in the preterm infant the effects of indomethacin on CBF velocity (CBFV) during clinical procedures (endotracheal suctioning) known to increase BP and CBFV concomitantly. All major cerebrovascular PGs (physiologically relevant doses) increased CBF, and contracted minimally isolated arteries. These effects were most evident for PGF$ sb{2 alpha}$, the most effective adult vasoconstrictor PG. During hypotension, sagittal sinus concentrations of thromboxane exhibited the highest increase of all prostanoids. However, during hypertension, PGE, PGF$ sb{2 alpha}$, and 6-keto-PGF$ sb{1 alpha}$ increased, without changes in TXB$ sb2$. Ibuprofen, inhibited the changes in prostanoids that occurred as a function of BP, and widened CBF autoregulation from 50-90 mm Hg to 35-117 mm Hg of BP. Therefore, the potent vasoconstrictor, thromboxane, contributed to set the lower limit of the CBF autoregulatory range to 50 mm Hg of BP; and PGs (which increase newborn CBF) contributed to the pressure-passivity of CBF above 90 mm Hg. In the preterm newborn infant, indomethacin attenuated the increases in CBFV that occur with endotracheal suctioning; thus, in accord with studies on animals subjected to changes in BP. In conclusion, PGs possess minimal cerebral vasocontractile activity in the newborn. The findings confirm our hypothesis that prostanoids contribute significantly in establishing the range of CBF autoregulation of the newborn, which is principally narrowed at its upper limit compared to that of the adult. Thus, the difference in the CBF autoregulatory range of the newborn and adult animal appears to result mainly from age-related differences in the effects of PGs on cerebral hemodynamics. Finally, ibuprofen may provide therapeutic modes to prevent hemorrhagic and ischemic encephalopathies of the newborn.</description><creator>Chemtob, Sylvain</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</subject><title>The role of prostaglandins in autoregulation of cerebral blood flow of the newborn /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j9602133w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kk91fm17z</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fj236271k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Sea ice characteristics were studied in relation to nutrient dynamics, biomass and community structure and composition of ice biota from the Gulf of St. Lawrence at landfast and drifting ice stations in the Magdalen Islands area. The instability of the ice substrate was demonstrated with respect to short duration of cover (8 weeks), ice melt and rafting processes. The study of nutrient dynamics in ice and in seawater suggests silicates and nitrogen (NO$ sb2$+NO$ sb3$+NH$ sb4$) limitation at landfast ice stations, as well as in situ regeneration of phosphorus in the bottom ice sections. No correlation was found between microalgal biomass and nutrients, but specific growth rates were in the lower range of values reported for Arctic ice algae. The composition of the microalgal ice biota revealed two types of communities. The first type was composed of a majority of pennate diatoms (abundance $&gt;$ 98%), with dominant species such as Nitzschia cylindrus, N. polaris and Navicula kariana, similar to Arctic landfast ice biota communities. The second type was composed of a high percentage of centric diatoms (abundance $&gt;$ 46%) due to the abundance of the planktonic diatom Thalassiosira norderskioldii.

Testing of associated predictions disclosed that deer expanded their diets over the course of the yarding season, showed shifts in proportional representation of browse species in their diet, and exhibited distinct but changing preferences for certain browse types. Partial preferences in diet choices occurred, but important diet items were used in nonrandom runs once adopted into the diet. Cornus stolonifera was the dominant browse species in the diet based on construction of a functional response curve, with the use of other species influenced by C. stolonifera depletion. Deer took a greater number of twigs from denser browse plots, and made more browsing visits to dense plots over the yarding season. Browsed plots tended to be higher in total twig availability and C. stolonifera availability than unbrowsed plots for the first half of the yarding season only. Diameter at point of browsing (DPB) values increased over the season for C. stolonifera and Salix. Results indicate that winter deer foraging is a dynamic process, with high diet selectivity at the beginning of the yarding season, and gradual diet generalization in the face of overall browse depletion.</description><creator>Brown, David T.</creator><date>1988</date><subject>White-tailed deer -- Wintering.</subject><title>Winter foraging behaviour of white-tailed deer (odocoileus virginianus) in a northern deer yard</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j3860765p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mp48sd38w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Renewable Resources</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g158bh91f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Solid modeling studies how to represent geometric properties of solids by computer. A fundamental operation is the construction of representations of solids. Algorithms for set operations construct boundary representations of solids from boundary representations of other solids. A correct and efficient intersection algorithm for polyhedral solids that uses boundary representations is described. A finite-precision implementation of the algorithm uses incidence tests that use symbolic inference in order to limit errors due to finite-precision approximations. The incidence tests are described and experimental evidence is presented to show that the incidence tests are both empirically reliable and practical. The intersection algorithm uses a new boundary representation called the Star-Edge representation. A complementation algorithm for solids that uses the new representation is given, and an algorithm is given that uses the new representation to determine if two boundary representations describe the same solid. A canonical boundary representation for solids is described and used to prove a lower bound for the same-object problem.</description><creator>Karasick, Michael</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>On the representation and manipulation of rigid solids</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k0698818x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g158bh91f</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hd76s0880</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Structural effects in small molecule and polymer systems have been studied through heat capacity measurements (small molecule systems), phase diagrams and heat of mixing measurements (polymer systems). It has been found that structure due to molecular antipathy i.e. large H$ sp{ rm E}$ and G$ sp{ rm E}$ manifests itself through a W-shape C$ sbsp{ rm p}{ rm E}$ which is found to be a summation of two contributions to the thermodynamics: random and non-random. An excellent correlation is made between C$ sbsp{ rm p}{ rm E}$ and the concentration-concentration correlation function (S$ sb{ rm CC}$). The non-randomness effect increases drastically as T moves towards the UCST. Non-randomness (S$ sb{ rm CC}$) and the effect of non-randomness (C$ sbsp{ rm p}{ rm E}$) are found toward the middle of the concentration range. It has been found that the W-shape is not a wide-spread phenomenon for other second-order quantities such as d V$ sp{ rm E}$/dT and d V$ sp{ rm E}$/dP, in spite of a certain similarity of the critical exponent for C$ sb{ rm p}$, $ alpha sb{ rm p}$ and $ kappa sb{ rm T}$. d V$ sp{ rm E}$/dT results have been discussed in terms of Flory theory. The difference between experimental and theoretical values provides a good estimation of the non-random d V$ sp{ rm E}$/dT. Structure has also been studied through H-bonding interactions (self-association or complex formation) between methanol, butanol, decanol in CCl$ sb{ rm 4}$, acetonitrile or octanenitrile and dodecanenitrile in n-decane, CCl$ sb{ rm 4}$ or xylene. C$ sbsp{ rm p}{ rm E}$ are predicted using the Treszczanowicz-Kehiaian theory. Structure in polymer solutions has been associated with specific interactions which lead to a low temperature LCST. An extended Flory-Huggins-Prigogine theory has been used to interpret the phase diagram of specifically interacting polymer systems. Compatibility between polymer pairs is also linked to the presence of these specific interactions which are associated with an exothermic heat of mixing. $ Delta$H$ sb{ rm M}$ has been measured for ternary systems i.e. two polymers and a mutual solvent. Exothermic $ Delta$H$ sb{ rm M}$ is observed if the pair strongly interacts while $ Delta$H$ sb{ rm M}$ is positive if the polymers are incompatible or if they do not interact similarly with the solvent, in which case non-randomness plays a major role.</description><creator>Saint Victor, Marie-Esther</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Chemistry, Physical.</subject><title>Heat capacity and structure in small molecule and polymer systems</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1v53jx70q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hd76s0880</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z316q218k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Determining the optimal long-term operating policy of a multi-reservoir power system requires solution of a stochastic nonlinear programming problem. For small systems, the solution can be found by dynamic programming, but for large systems no direct solution method exists yet, so that one must resort to mathematical manipulations to solve the problem. This thesis presents a very efficient procedure for the case where high correlation exists between the state variables. It consists in performing principal components analysis on the trajectories to find a reduced model of the system. The reduced model is then substituted into the operating problem and the resulting problem is solved by stochastic dynamic programming. The reservoir trajectories on which principal components analysis are performed can be obtained by solving the operating problem deterministically for a large number of equally likely flow sequences. The results of applying the manipulation to Quebec's La Grande river, which has four reservoirs, are reported. A comparison with the classical dynamic programming, that is without any reduction, is also studied and results are reported to show the efficiency of the principal components approach.</description><creator>Saad, Maarouf</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Application of principal components analysis to long-term reservoir management</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/js956g515.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z316q218k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rf55z850j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Rotary blasthole drills operating in a western Canadian surface coal mine were instrumented with microprocessor-based monitoring equipment. During routine production drilling, the performance parameters of penetration rate, torque, rotary speed, pulldown and bailing air pressure were monitored at sampling intervals of 10 centimeters (4 inches). The acquired digital data were subsequently correlated with both geological and geomechanical rock properties permitting a detailed examination of machine-rock interaction. The results from a statistical analysis of the drill data identified unique ranges of performance parameters for the sandstone, siltstone, mudstone and coal units encountered at the mine. Correlation of these ranges with geophysical logs in the monitored boreholes, enabled a further calibration of drilling parameter variation to rock type. A relationship between drill performance parameter responses and rock compressive and shear strength was established. This correlation demonstrated the possibility of estimating rock strength properties based on drill performance data. Trend analysis techniques applied to the monitored drill data permitted a further understanding of the nature of tricone bit wear for the particular study environment. The applications of drill monitoring techniques are illustrated in terms of geological exploration, mine planning, tricone bit selection and wear evaluation, and drill automation and control.</description><creator>Peck, Jonathan Philip</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Engineering, Mining.</subject><title>Performance monitoring of rotary blasthole drills</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/70795841z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rf55z850j</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9019s318p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>An infrared detector is constructed for use in High Pressure Liquid Chromatography.

One area where calmodulin is suggested to play a role is the fusion of the secretory granule with the plasma membrane during exocytosis. Calmodulin may mediate the interaction or fusion through specific calmodulin-binding proteins (CMBPs) present in these two membranes. CMBPs present in bovine chromaffin cell granule membranes were characterized using the techniques of calmodulin affinity chromatography and $ sp{125}$I calmodulin overlay. Several CMBPs were detected in these membranes. One of these proteins, of molecular mass 65 kilodaltons (65-CMBP), was found to be immunologically identical to a protein previously identified in rat brain synaptic vesicles termed "p65". Recent studies have debated the subcellular localization of 65-CMBP (p65) as well as another synaptic vesicle protein, synaptophysin (p38). A controversial question surrounding these proteins is whether or not they are present in large dense core secretory granules of neurons and endocrine cells, or exclusively localized on small synaptic or synaptic-like vesicles present in these tissues. Subcellular fractionation studies of adrenal medulla showed that both 65-CMBP and p38 were present in fractions corresponding to granule membranes and intact granules. However, an additional membrane fraction equilibrating near the upper portion of the sucrose gradient, also showed strong immunoreactivity with an antibody to p38. CMBPs were also isolated from bovine posterior pituitary neurosecretory granules and rat brain synaptic vesicles. These membranes were also found to contain the 65-CMBP (63 kDa in rat brain synaptic vesicles). Chromaffin cell membranes were isolated using positively charged microcarriers. The 65-CMBP (p65) was also identified in this structure. In addition, immunoblots of plasma and granule membranes showed that the 65-CMBP was a component of both membranes, whereas p38 was only present in granule membranes. Thus, there appears to be a different subcellular localization between the 65-CMBP and p38 in chromaffin cells. These findings on the 65-CMBP are discussed in relation to its possible role as a mediator of the fusion step of the exocytotic process.</description><creator>Fournier, Sue.</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</subject><title>Calmodulin binding proteins in chromaffin and other neurosecretory cells</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sb397899j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6395w7947</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:47429987k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Abelson murine leukemia virus can induce oligoclonal pre-B and T-cell lymphomas in mice. Expression of the v-abl oncogene in target cells does not appear to be sufficient for tumor formation and additional genetic events are thought to be required. The potential role of the Moloney helper virus as an insertional mutagen was investigated in Abelson lymphomas. A cellular region was found occupied by the helper virus in 16% of Abelson pre-B lymphomas. This new common proviral integration site, designated Ahi-1, was cloned and mapped to the murine chromosome 10. In contrast to pre-B lymphomas, the presence of competent helper virus was not required for efficient induction of Abelson thymomas and Ahi-1 did not appear to be implicated in these tumors. These data suggest a distinct role for the helper virus in Abelson pre-B and T-cell lymphomas and distinct biological requirements for induction of these lymphomas by the v-abl oncogene.</description><creator>Poirier, Yves</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Studies on the role of the helper virus in abelson murine leukemia virus lymphomagenesis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8910jv31x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/47429987k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xg94hq319</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The effect of shear rate on the ADP-induced aggregation of human blood platelets in flow through tubes was studied over the full physiologically significant range. The extent of single platelet aggregation at 0.2 $ mu$M ADP in citrated platelet-rich plasma, PRP, was greatest at mean tube shear rate, G = 314 s$ sp{-1}$; however, aggregate size steadily decreased from G = 39.3 to 1800 s$ sp{-1}$. At 1.0 $ mu$M ADP the rate of aggregation increased up to G = 1800 s$ sp{-1}$ where virtually no unaggregated platelets remained after 43 s of flow, although, aggregate size was still limited by shear rate. A shear-dependent delay in the onset of aggregation and an increase in collision efficiency with time suggest the existence of a time and shear-dependency in the expression of bonds mediating aggregation. Greater aggregation of platelets from female donors than male donors was due to differences in the ionized calcium concentration, (Ca$ sp{2+}$), in the plasma of donors of different hematocrit when the chelating agent citrate is used as anticoagulant. At physiological (Ca$ sp{2+}$) aggregation was much greater in heparinized and hirudinized plasma than in citrated plasma and no sex difference was present. Aggregation in whole blood was much greater than in PRP due to a shear-dependent increase in the frequency of collision between activated platelets caused by the motion of red cells.</description><creator>Bell, David N.</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Biophysics, Medical.</subject><title>Physical factors governing the aggregation of human platelets in sheared suspensions</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/76537189d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94hq319</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qf85nb84h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis reports on an ethnographic study of communicative interaction between young Inuit children and their caregivers. Data were derived from three sources: 80 hours of videotape of four children (aged 1,0-1,8 years at the outset) and their families, 20 ethnographic interviews of mothers, and participant observation notes. Themes emerged about the specific accommodations that Inuit caregivers made in their communication with young children. Child-centered accommodations included: (a) two special registers of affectionate talk, (b) specialized vocabulary, (c) making language more understandable to children, and (d) excluding children from adult conversations. Situation-centered accommodations instructed children through teasing and repetition routines. Finally, silence played an important role in communicative interaction. Inuit children were socialized to learn by listening and to communicate without talk. Stated cultural values, the status and role of the Inuit child, and the structure of caregiving influenced these patterns of communicative interaction.</description><creator>Crago, Martha B., 1945-</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Education, Educational Psychology.</subject><title>Cultural context in communicative interaction of inuit children</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0c483j976.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qf85nb84h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Human Communication Disorders</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n870zr39h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:55:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis a general method for the formulation of the dynamical equations of general $N$-axis, serial-type robotic manipulators of otherwise arbitrary architecture, with rigid and flexible links, is presented. The dynamic simulation of this type of manipulator is also included. The two different methods of formulation discussed here are the hybrid Newton-Euler (NE)/Euler-Lagrange (EL) formulation for the study of flexible-link manipulators and the NE formulation, for the study of rigid-link manipulators. The hybrid NE/EL formulation lends itself to a systematic and conceptually straightforward formulation for flexible-link manipulators, as opposed to the NE formulation which, in this case, will be much more difficult. The novelty in both of the approaches is the introduction of the natural orthogonal complement to eliminate the constraint wrenches, which are readily computed from the generalized twist of the overall manipulator. Another salient feature of the natural orthogonal complement method is that it can be readily applied to manipulators with kinematic loops. The formulation of the dynamical equations of flexible-link manipulators is carried out by considering each link as an unconstrained body and writing its EL equations disregarding kinematic couplings. These equations are expressed in terms of the body twist and its time derivative. The individual-link equations, along with the associated constraint wrenches, are assembled to obtain the constrained dynamical equations of the manipulator. The nonworking constraint wrenches are then efficiently eliminated by simple matrix multiplication of the said equations by the transpose of the natural orthogonal complement to obtain the independent dynamical equations. These equations are then solved for accelerations using the Cholesky decomposition. The integration of the accelerations is performed using Gear's stiff method of backward differentiation. To ascertain the effects of link flexibility on the overall performance of the manipulator, the dynamic simulation of the flexible-link manipulator is compared with the dynamic simulation of the same manipulator considering all links to be rigid. Numerical examples, chosen from specialized literature are included to demonstrate the validity of the dynamical equations and the algorithms to solve them. The dynamic simulation, ranging from a single-link- to a six-link-manipulator, with all links flexible, is presented. The results of simulations for all these manipulators indicate that the effects of structural flexibility on the motion of the manipulator can be considerable even at low speeds. The simulation results also bring to light the effects of various joint torques on the elastic behaviour of the manipulator. Finally, it was found that the stability of the numerical integration schemes used depended largely on the type of input joint torques.</description><creator>Cyril, Xavier</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Dynamics of flexible-link manipulators</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fx719n08v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n870zr39h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):35950</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
