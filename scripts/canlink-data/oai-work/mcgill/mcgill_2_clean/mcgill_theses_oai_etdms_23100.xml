To date, the control of tunnelling machines has not been automated to any significant extent. This thesis investigates the dynamic control of a vertical turret, boom-type tunnelling machine. Models of the actuators, kinematics, rigid body dynamics, and cutter-rock interaction are formulated. These models are validated through computer simulation. Controllers are then designed for the actuators using the pole-placement technique, in both continuous and discrete time. The controllers are tested in a variety of operational modes, using the computer simulation of the machine model. Results show that good tracking and disturbance rejection is achieved.</description><creator>Wu, Hongjin</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Engineering, Mining.</subject><title>Dynamic modelling, simulation, and control of a vertical turret tunnelling machine</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6w924c889.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/44558f40n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bc386k49h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:00:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) reduces 5,10-methylene THF to 5-methyl THF, the carbon donor for the methylation of homocysteine to methionine. Patients with severe MTHFR deficiency (MRD) have neurologic abnormalities while a milder form (a thermolabile MTHFR variant) has been shown to be associated with coronary artery disease (CAD). Ten MRD patients, with reduced or non-detectable activity, were studied to characterize the nature of the mutation. Southern, Northern and Western analysis did not reveal any defects in the patients. These results suggest that the mutations may be minor insertions/deletions or single base substitutions that affect catalytic activity. Single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis was used to detect base substitutions; 3 RFLPs were identified with this protocol. One was in the coding region (SphI) while the other two were in the 3$ sp prime$ untranslated region (MaeIII and MnlI). A difference in frequency of the SphI RFLP was found between control subjects and a small sample of CAD patients whose homocysteine levels were greater than the 99th percentile.</description><creator>Low-Nang, Lawrence</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Folic acid deficiency.</subject><subject>Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase</subject><title>Investigation of mutations in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6d56zx68f.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bc386k49h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:d504rm519</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:00:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Four microbial lipases were examined to test a proposed substrate model based on the relative size of the substituents on the stereogenic carbon of $ alpha$-substituted carboxylic acids (Fig. 5). Literature and our results for the kinetic resolution of carboxylic acids with the lipases from Candida rugosa, Aspergillus niger, Mucor meihei and Pseudomonas cepacia showed that sterics alone do not account for enzymatic enantioselectivity. In the course of this work, it was found that the lipase from Aspergillus niger showed appreciable enantioselectivity (E = 19 $ pm$ 3 at pH 7/10 mM phosphate buffer) in the hydrolysis of methyl pipecolinate. Given that there are limited ways to obtain optically pure pipecolinic acid, our results offered a viable alternative. Consequently, three strategies were used to improve this enantioselectivity. Altering reaction conditions (pH, concentration and type of buffer) and substrate modifications did not improve enantioselectivity significantly. Partial purification of the crude lipase from Aspergillus niger improved the enantiomeric ratio from ca. 20 to greater than 100 for the hydrolysis of octyl pipecolinate.</description><creator>Ng Youn Chen, Marie Christine</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><title>Kinetic resolution of carboxylic acids by microbial lipases</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xg94hq85m.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d504rm519</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:f4752h80h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:00:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A flow injection (FI) preconcentration system has been coupled with a direct sample insertion (DSI) system for inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). The FI system developed uses an ion exchange microcolumn to provide preconcentration factors of approximately for several metals. Improved DSI detection limits are obtained by employing a graphite sample probe of reduced mass. The improvements are element specific and range between 10 and 130. The combination of the two optimized systems results in overall detection limit improvements ranging between 140 and 1200 for the elements tested, Cu, Pb and Zn. Precision of the FI-DSI-ICP system averages 4% rsd for these three elements. The flow injection system is fully automated and under computer control, resulting in a reproducible FI processing time of 6.0 minutes, using 5 mL injection volumes. The system offers considerably potential for further gains in performance, by increasing the injection volumes used and optimizing the interface.</description><creator>Moss, Pamela A.

Experiments are performed with different combinations of a seasonal cycle being present or not on the restoring temperature, the surface freshwater flux fields (mixed boundary conditions) and the surface wind forcing. Despite the presence of the forcing on the dominant seasonal timescale, it is found that the system may oscillate at the decadal period or longer. The decadal variability is excited by changes in the net surface density flux which are due to the advection of temperature and salinity anomalies in the model domain. The magnitude of the seasonal cycle also plays an important role in determining the timescale of variability. Violent overturning events may occur on the century timescale under seasonal forcing. The magnitudes of the flushes are reduced compared to those found in similar experiments without the presence of a seasonal cycle.</description><creator>Myers, Paul Glen</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Physical Oceanography.</subject><title>Seasonal forcing and low-frequency variability of the thermohaline circulation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pr76f461j.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x346d5349</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Meteorology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:r781wh15d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:00:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In parallel to the development of a PC-control system for injection moulding, a workable user interface for man-machine communication was developed. The hardware includes an IBM PC/AT, PS/2 model 70. A real-time multi-task operating system, QNX 4.0 (Quantum Software Sys. Ltd.) was installed to run applications programmed in the language C (WATCOM Sys. Inc.). A top-down structure was adopted, comprising menus, warnings, and directives. The user interface includes three tasks to run concurrently, the main-task, the real-time machine-status display task, and the task to display the current barrel-heater temperatures. Four controller types, a digital PID and three discrete controllers, the total of cycles for the machine to run, and operating modes can be specified by scrolling sub-menus. All data processed on the loading, editing, and saving level, are character strings that will be converted to appropriate data types just before machine activation. Inter-task communication is accomplished by sharing global memory segments between display tasks and the tasks in charge for data acquisition and control. The interface tasks do not exert a large claim on system resources.</description><creator>Fusser, Harry B.</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><subject>Plastics Technology.</subject><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>A man-machine interface for PC-controlled injection moulding /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r494vm13m.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r781wh15d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gq67js290</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:00:34Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Music notation represents what a composer creates. This research is concerned with the problem of compression, without distortion, of complete scores of musical pieces. The musical score source has many interesting characteristics which set it apart from other information sources; for example, it is a collection of parallel 'parts'; the durations of symbols (notes) are variable; and the transitions between notes in different parts need not be simultaneous. These distinguishing features are discussed and incorporated into the procedure described in this work. The research consists of three parts. The first is the design of a representation system allowing musical scores to be stored on digital media. The second is the development of a simple music editor and the compilation of two pieces of music. The third is the design and implementation of a compression algorithm. Significantly higher compression ratios are achieved using the designed algorithm vis-a-vis those achieved using a standard general data compression algorithm.</description><creator>McCausland, William James</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><subject>Music.</subject><title>Distortion free compression of musical scores</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0g354g44m.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gq67js290</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qv33rx821</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:00:34Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study surveyed the attitudes of 59 Secondary V students of Greek origin who were studying in the French language.

A novel technique, based on electrohydrodynamic (EHD) principles, was used in this realm to desalinate artificial sea water of 3.3% (w/V) concentration. A single point corona electrode was operated at a potential of 5.3 kV (maximum output current 0.3 mA), and was installed one cm over the surface of sea water. The flux of air ions was about 3.0 $ times$ 10$ sp{12}$ cm$ sp{-2}$ s$ sp{-1}$ which produced an average electric wind of 1.72 m s$ sp{-1}$ at the sea water surface. Space charge from a corona electrode generated forces in the media to enhance the evaporation rate by about a factor of three compared with a control freely evaporating sea water. Water vapour was condensed and the condensate's purity was evaluated by chemical and physical analyses. Electrical conductivity and pH of the EHD distillate were found to be 14 $ mu$S cm$ sp{-1}$ and 5.5, respectively. In the absence of Joule heating, the energy required for EHD-distillation was comparable to the latent heat of vaporization of 2.3 $ times$ 10$ sp3$ kJ kg$ sp{-1}$ for water. The steady-state temperature of EHD solution was below that of the corresponding unventilated freely evaporating sea water. Electric wind caused by the ionic drag is considered to be the principal driving force for the enhancement.</description><creator>Chen, Yuanhong</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Saline water conversion.</subject><subject>Electrohydrodynamics.</subject><title>Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) desalination of sea water</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m039k620t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f1881n13m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Renewable Resources</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gm80hw57n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:00:35Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Nineteen cultivars and fourteen breeding lines were evaluated for partial resistance to crown rust Puccinia coronata race 264.

First, I survey how the "real" has been traditionally theorized in film theory. The realist/anti-realist debate is addressed; the psycholinguistic theory of Jacques Lacan and Jean Baudrillard's postmodern model of the hyperreal are reexamined in light of their profound effect on film theory's model of the cinematic "real." I argue against these theories as models of spectatorship and the "real" because of their hermetic nature. I then consider Walter Benjamin's Passagen-Werk and the "dialectical image" as an alternative approach to the problems of the "real." Benjamin's model takes into consideration both the epistemological nature of the image and the problematics of cultural context.

With the ever-changing circumstances of the World, engendered particularly by developments in science and technology, as by inconstancy in the socio-political disposition of Mankind, the adaptability of the said regulatory scheme assumes a perennially major focal point within the legal systems concerned.

This thesis examines how changes in the telecommunications environment have affected inter-system coordination procedures and what the future application of these procedures may be. The historical background and organizational structure of INTELSAT are discussed in order to obtain a better understanding of the issue. The inter-system coordination procedures in the INTELSAT Agreements, including examples of coordinations that have been completed, are examined. Three main changes in international telecommunications that have affected INTELSAT are discussed: private satellite systems and deregulatory changes; fiber optic cable systems; and technical constraints as the result of increasing orbital congestion. In turn, the possible future of inter-system coordination procedures is analyzed in the light of the new strategic plan INTELSAT has adopted as a response to the changing environment.</description><creator>Bahar, Wahyuni</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Mass Communications.</subject><subject>Law.</subject><subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</subject><title>Coordination of a separate communications satellite system under the intelsat agreements : legal analysis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s1784m887.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94hq86w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6d56zx69q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:00:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Quantitative and functional methods were used to assess in vivo changes in NK cell numbers and function in the spleen and bone marrow of mice (1) bearing a congenital immune-deficiency, (2) transiently reared (1 month) in a low pathogen environment, (3) bearing early and late-stage hemopoietic tumor and (4) administered the NK cell stimulants rIL-2 and/or indomethacin.

Briefly there was an enhanced production and turnover of NK cells in immunologically deficient mice relative to normal mice. In normal mice, both indomethacin and tumor cells, i.e. erythroleukemia, administered/injected independently increased the number of NK cells in the spleen and bone marrow by 14 days relative to control.

In The Origin of German Tragic Drama he proposes allegory as an appropriate form for the representation of the past because it drains images of life so that they may be re-presented with the meaning endowed by the allegorist. In a similar way, literary criticism and historical materialism are involved in the process of mortification so that, from the distance of time, truth may be glimpsed. Benjamin privileges the fragmentary form of representation in allegory over the false unity of the artistic symbol. Whereas truth may be fleetingly revealed by the symbol, allegory forces the extended contemplation of history. Benjamin's method is always negative, looking back rather than forward, and his two main preoccupations, Messianism and Marxism, reflect this desire to reclaim the past. Over and above these interests, however, is his profound sense of nihilism in his study of the ruins of human history.</description><creator>Broadfoot, Lisa</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Benjamin, Walter, 1892-1940.

The term "projected image" is used here as a collective concept for Antisemitic stereotypes, which were developed over the centuries and played a significant role in the persecution of the Jews. In his novel, the author initially projects this negative image onto the protagonist. By way of contrast, figures who represent positive embodiments of a Jewish identity and who are drawn from the authentic, historical experiences of Jewry are also presented. Through this constellation, the initially negative character of Suss undergoes a transformation. This thesis analyses the novel's use of the Antisemitic image of the "Jew", the positive foils, and Suss's character, within the context of the result's of modern research into Antisemitism. Passages from Antisemitic tracts serve as parallels to examples from the novel. Thus emerges one of the central themes of the novel: the persecution of the Jews as an integral part of Jewish history and of the Jewish identity itself.</description><creator>Guay, Bodil</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Feuchtwanger, Lion, 1884-1958.

The Jesuits' attempt to identify Indians according to permanent customs and manners is compared to conventional ethnographic description and is shown to result in a reductive, essentializing discourse. In their elaboration of the category of 'savagery' Jesuits metaphorically equated Indians with wild animals. They then stressed the need for reclaiming the Indians' humanity through conversion to Christianity. The Jesuits' figuration of the spiritual realm as a territory to be subdued and conquered is discussed, and the language of conversion is revealed as a language of control and conquest. It is finally argued that Jesuit representations of Indians functioned as an instrument of colonial domination. The analysis points to the need for decolonization of textual and historical spaces dominated by Eurocolonial discourses.</description><creator>Blackburn, Carole</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Jesuits -- Missions -- Québec (Province)</subject><subject>Montagnais Indians -- Missions</subject><subject>Huron Indians -- Missions.</subject><title>'Harvest of souls' : tropes of transformation and domination in the Jesuit relations</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c821gk98k.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7w62f952s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anthropology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:c247dt262</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:00:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Moral education in Japanese and Taiwanese primary schools is an important source of political socialization. An analysis of these two countries' moral education curricula reveals traditions which reinforce national solidarity and central governmental authority. Moreover, political ideology is merged with supporting academic, economic, and cultural values. This study examines the political ideology of the moral education curricula in Japanese and Taiwanese primary schools, the values and behavior promoted by these ideologies, as well as the similarities and differences between the Japanese and Taiwanese systems. It is shown that a distinctive feature of both systems is the emphasis placed on political conformism, high academic achievement, professional diligence and economic success.</description><creator>Beaupré, Charles P.

Holding one tetrahedron fixed, the motion of the other one is investigated, subject to the constraint that edges formed by the diagonals of the same cube face remain coplanar, i.e., intersect or coincide. Based entirely on the solution of equations arising directly from this constraint, displacement of the movable tetrahedron is expressed as rigid body rotation with translation. This original result forms the foundation upon which kinematic and dynamic analyses are built: (1) Edge pair intersections are expressed in closed, parametric form so as to facilitate further investigation. (2) A closed-form solution for the two degree-of-freedom workspace boundary is obtained by evaluating conditions under which these parameters approach zero or one. This important extension of previous research is necessary to control the motion of any hardware implementation of a double tetrahedral mechanism. (3) Inverse kinematics, which concerns the motion of such a mechanism, is presented. Two kinds of singularity, basic position singularity and overlapping singularity, are discussed from the point of view of the Jacobian matrices. (4) Given a wrench applied to the movable frame, the system of reactive forces or torques needed at the joints, i.e., the edge intersections, is determined. (5) Using the Lagrangian formulation, the inverse dynamics of this mechanism are derived and simulation results are presented. (6) The possible application of the double tetrahedral mechanism as a two degree-of-freedom manipulator joint is discussed.</description><creator>Chen, Huan-Wei</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Kinematics and introduction to dynamics of a movable pair of tetrahedra</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vx021g401.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b2773w86n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sq87bv69v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:00:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis considers the transverse vibrational control of a single flexible beam under-going large planar rotational motion. The beam is modelled using a cubic spline technique, which approximates the linearly elastic, continuous beam with a finite number of nodal points. It is shown that kinetic boundary conditions such as those associated with tip loads can be included in the cubic spline model. This spatial discretization method provides a useful linear relationship between displacement and curvature, which allows the use of strain gages to measure curvature along the beam. An optimal control strategy is used to suppress the transverse vibrations while forcing the end tip to follow a prescribed trajectory. A Kalman filter is employed to optimally estimate state variables which are not obtained through direct measurement. These state variables can be classified into two groups: (1) state variables corresponding to the time rate of change of curvature, which cannot be measured using any existing sensor and (2) state variables associated with curvature at certain nodal points which results in a smaller number of sensors needed to control the entire beam.</description><creator>Cho, Kyung Sang</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>On the controllability and observability of flexible beams under rigid-body motion</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5x21tg525.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sq87bv69v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cz30pt817</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:00:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The manufacture of ceramic composites has traditionally been a complex and often expensive process. A new processing method, the DIMOX$ sp{ rm TM}$ process, takes advantage of the high temperature oxidation behaviour of aluminum alloys to produce a ceramic-metal composite. Although this process is fairly simple to implement, there has not been any attempt to link the starting materials and manufacturing conditions to the properties of the final composite. This work attempts to identify some critical parameters in the manufacturing process and how they affect the end product. The reaction temperature, alloy composition, and powder bed condition were optimized with respect to the growth process, final composition, and resulting microstructure. These characteristics were then related to the elasticity, strength, fracture toughness, and fracture mode of the final composite. Aluminum-magnesium-silicon alloys were oxidized into an alumina bed of either Alcan C-70 UNG power or Struers' 400 grit. The process conditions were optimized in air at 1120$ sp circ$C with a 10% silicon, 2% magnesium alloy. The growth rate was dependent on the powder bed. The material was composed of alumina, silicon, aluminum, and trace amounts of magnesium aluminate spinel. The fracture mode was dependent on the composition of the material and the alumina bed.</description><creator>Jaansalu, Kevin Michael</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</subject><title>Composites by directed oxidation of aluminum alloys</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2v23vv350.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cz30pt817</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:47429b40w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:00:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis examines hidden Markov filter models and their applications in speech segmentation. A method of segmenting the speech waveform is proposed. This method uses the Baum-Welch reestimation algorithm applied to the hidden filter models. Since speech signals are handled at the sample level, the amount of computations needed is very large. We will show how this issue can be dealt with effectively by using a staircase approach in the trellis calculations. The hidden Markov filters are used to segment speech signals. Test results show very consistent locations of phone boundaries. The hidden filter model fits vocalic segments very well (with normalized prediction errors of less than 0.01), but performs less well on consonants (with normalized prediction errors of up to 0.3). The speech segmentation by hidden filters is applied to a large vocabulary speaker dependent isolated-word recognizer at the preprocessing stage. The performances of the recognizer with and without preprocessor are compared. The results show small improvements in the recognition accuracy.</description><creator>Nguỹên, Bao, 1962-</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>The hidden filter model : applications for automatic speech processing</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9880vs04v.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/47429b40w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):23125</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
