Evidence was obtained to support the view that the podzolization process is more active under a conifer (hemlock) than under a deciduous (beach) canopy. It was found that the organic matter in the hemlock leachates was similar to the organic matter deposited in the B horizon of the soil studied. A chemical fractionation procedure was developed which isolated, from both hemlock leachate and B horizon extract, a substance that was potentially active in podzolization.</description><creator>Soper, Robert.
