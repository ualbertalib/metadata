Indeed, the author's manuscripts reveal important details about her creative process. In this thesis, we study the changes the author made to both style and content at different stages of the writing of "Jeannot-la-Corneille", one of the recits making up Cet ete qui chantait. The latter is one of Roy's least studied books. Our analysis of the modifications the author made to the content and style of her texts allows us to understand the reasons behind these changes and gives us as well a sense of Gabrielle Roy's creative work. Admired for the apparent ease with which she writes, the author reworks her text tirelessly in order to achieve the desired effects: precision, accuracy and musicality. Adjectives, adverbs, nouns, all parts of speech are subject to change in this quest to improve descriptions and, in so doing, deliver more effectively a message of hope.</description><creator>Courchesne, Sarah Geneviève, 1980-</creator><date>2009</date><subject>Roy, Gabrielle, 1909-1983.

To locate my analysis of postcolonial works, I survey Orientalist productions of the Muslim woman by European travelers and certain Muslim reformists. I read these repressive constructions of the Muslim woman through the lens of postcolonial critique. While postcolonial discourses about Muslim women are frequently framed as a "corrective" to Orientalist accounts, they are often limited by a commitment to teleological conceptions of development. This is especially true of the discourse of "Islamic Feminism" in the works of Margot Badran and miriam cooke. Examining Badran's and cooke's conceptions of feminism and religiosity, I highlight the ways in which it re-inscribes particular Orientalist assumptions, and remains bound by its adherence to secular-liberal values, and teleological conceptions of modernity. These biases carry serious implications for future scholarship about Muslim women within the Western Academy.</description><creator>Lakhani, Safia.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Orientalism.</subject><subject>Muslim women.</subject><subject>Postcolonialism.</subject><title>From orientalism to postcolonialism : producing the Muslim woman</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vq27zr95d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5138jj010</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Islamic Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g158bm90s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:30:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis, I explore and critique the content of the fashion teen magazine CosmoGirl. Through a bricolage of methods, I examine the magazine's representation of teen femininity and compare it to the editor's "pro-feminist" initial goal and intended social role for the publication. Drawing upon previous studies, and linking my findings to established theories, I analyze the possible relationship between the publication's content and the influence this media genre has on the social development of young women. My research findings show that CosmoGirl's portrayal of femininity is stereotypical, patriarchal and unrealistic and that such representation perpetuates negative and destructive feelings in young women. In my discussion, I explore possible reasons for the lack of representation of the editor's goal for the magazine within the magazine's overall discourse. I also discuss the importance of media literacy in education as a means to alter today's media, so its representation of women becomes truthful.</description><creator>Chaparro, Lara I., 1977-</creator><date>2009</date><subject>Women's periodicals, American.</subject><subject>Teenage girls -- Books and reading.</subject><subject>Mass media and teenagers.</subject><subject>Teenage girls -- Attitudes.</subject><title>Analysis of messages in adolescent girls' magazines : CosmoGirl vs. CosmoGirls</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kw52jc384.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g158bm90s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Culture and Values in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:tm70n001b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:30:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study, through the lens of Activity Theory, focused on the induction and constructivist teaching practices of experienced teachers who were recently hired in a technologically advantaged middle school. Activity Theory was used not only to examine the induction practices but also to focus on constructivist practices with technology. Data sources consisted of using various instruments three of which were used for surveys, 11 interviews were employed to assess goals, and 18 classroom observations were carried out regarding constructivist practices. Findings through Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) analysis revealed under-realized forms of mediation to achieve effective use of ICTs (objective) and the perceptions of collaboration among the teaching staff, specifically with respect to relationships between rules and the division of labor. In effect, this study presents a challenge for CHAT analysis to elaborate the construct of contradictions to include "latent contradictions" which is essential to an expansive learning cycle.</description><creator>Nussbaumer, Doris.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Communication -- Technological innovations.</subject><subject>Educational technology.</subject><subject>Constructivism (Education)</subject><subject>Information technology.</subject><title>Induction of professional teachers and their constructivist practices with ICTs</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5q47rs34c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tm70n001b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:m900nz15x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:31:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study is about Michel Morin's opera omnia, a contemporary Quebec essayist and philosopher. The first part analyzes Morin's work with a sustained attention given to the question of the essay as a specific literary and philosophical genre (with references to Vigneault, Lukacs, Adorno, Barthes). Morin's work is for us the occasion to develop a reflection on the relationship between literature and philosophy (with references to Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Bergson, Heidegger). Finally, going forward, we elaborate the concept of philosophy as Ideational Novel to read Morin's work, a concept that describes Morin's intellectual adventure and involvement in the reflexive text. The second part proposes a more detailed analysis of Michel Morin's reflexive adventure through four distinct moments. All Morin's essays will be studied. Issues and beacons-ideas will be analyzed without ever losing sight of the genuine style of his writing.</description><creator>Nadeau, Simon, 1982-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Morin, Michel, 1949- -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><title>La philosophie comme roman idéel : introduction à l'œuvre de Michel Morin</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fx719q622.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m900nz15x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:db78tg505</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:31:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The persistent use of child soldiers in war continues to be a serious problem for many countries locked in conflicts around the world, yet surprisingly little attention has been given to those actors who are recruiting children in the greatest numbers: namely, non-state armed groups (NSAs). In recent years, several NSAs have entered into formal commitments with UNICEF to end their child recruitment practices; what is more interesting, they have done so during periods of active conflict. Why have these armed groups signed such agreements? Are there observable patterns among these NSAs that could better help us predict the likelihood of engaging with other groups in the future?

This study investigates the independent association of depressive symptoms with physical functioning after controlling for both demographic and disease characteristics. Fifty-two patients, mean age 61 (SD = 14) years, undergoing cardiac catheterization, completed self-report questionnaires of depressive symptoms and physical functioning. Results showed that depressive symptoms (beta = -.28, p &lt; .05) accounted for a statistically significant 8% of incremental variance in physical functioning over and above the variance explained by demographic and disease characteristics. The direction of effects cannot be determined because of the cross-sectional design. As such, the association of depressive symptoms with physical functioning in PH patients indicates the need for longitudinal research regarding the possible effect of depression on disease outcomes in this population.</description><creator>Pierre, Andrena.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Depression -- epidemiology.</subject><subject>Hypertension, Pulmonary.</subject><subject>Hypertension, Pulmonary -- psychology.</subject><subject>Quality of Life -- psychology.</subject><title>Prevalence of depressive symptoms and its relationship to physical functioning in pulmonary hypertension</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n870zv105.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4b29b9499</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychiatry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ms35tc734</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:31:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>As a nation, Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) faces increasing rates of noncommunicable diseases related to the replacement of the traditional diet with processed imported food and adoption of sedentary lifestyles. To reverse this trend, a food-based intervention in Pohnpei, FSM, used various approaches to promote local food (LF) production and consumption. Evaluation of the intervention in one community assessed changes in diet and health status in a random sample of households (n=47). Process indicators were also examined. Results from dietary assessments indicated increased (110%) provitamin A carotenoid intake; increased frequency of consumption of local banana (53%), giant swamp taro (475%), and local vegetables (130%); and increased diversity from LF. There was no change in health measures. However, exposure to intervention activities was high, and behaviour towards LF appeared to have changed positively. It is recommended that the intervention continue and expand to further affect dietary change and improve health.</description><creator>Kaufer, Laura Allison Iler, 1980-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Diet -- Micronesia (Federated States) -- Pohnpei Island.</subject><subject>Nutrition -- Micronesia (Federated States) -- Pohnpei Island.</subject><title>Evaluation of a traditional food for health intervention in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fn107257m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ms35tc734</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cz30px31n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:31:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Antibody-mediated rejection is central to ABO incompatible transplantation as well as to xenotransplantation. The xenoantigen alpha-Gal has a highly analogous carbohydrate structure to the human blood group antigens, and both require memory B cell activation for antibody production. We hypothesize that B cells, reactive to the alpha-Gal xenoantigen and B blood group antigen, require the presence of fully activated T cells in order to survive and proliferate in vitro, contrary to the traditional theory that humoral response to carbohydrate antigens is a T cell-independent process. When we compared the capacity of B cells to proliferate, we observed that activated T cells were necessary for B cell proliferation even in the presence of carbohydrate-derived antigens. A relevant question was also to investigate the role of a specific class of T cells: the CD1d-restricted iNKT cells, in the activation of alpha-Gal and B blood group-reactive B cells. The iNKT cells have the specificity of being reactive to glycolipids and are capable of producing both T helper 1 and T helper 2 cytokine responses. We therefore wanted to determine the role of the iNKT cells as mediators of a T helper 2-type response when B cells were exposed to a glycolipid antigen expressing the alpha-Gal epitope or the human B blood group antigen. We observed that, if the interaction between B cells and iNKT cells is blocked, neither B cell proliferation nor antibody production occurs. These results suggest therefore the importance of the iNKT cell category of T helper cells in the response to alpha-Gal and ABO-blood group glycolipids.</description><creator>Kandeva, Teodora N., 1983-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Swine.</subject><subject>Transplantation, Heterologous.</subject><subject>ABO Blood-Group System -- immunology.</subject><subject>Blood Group Incompatibility -- immunology.</subject><title>Humoral response to carbohydrate antigens in the context of ABO-incompatible transplantation and xenotransplantation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4j03d345p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cz30px31n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Surgical Research</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z316q508z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:31:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>To compare health care use from neonatal discharge to 18 months corrected age of two groups of extremely preterm children (&lt; 26 vs. 26-29 weeks of gestation), we used a province-wide database containing neonatal and follow-up data on 254 infants (77% of survivors) born at &lt; 29 weeks of gestation and cared for at 3/6 neonatal units in Quebec in 2003-2004. Neonatal data were abstracted from medical records by trained personnel. At 18 months corrected age, neurodevelopmental status was assessed by psychologists and paediatricians. Data on health care use were collected from charts and parent interviews. Descriptive statistics are provided and logistic regression analysis was carried out to evaluate perinatal and social determinants of re-hospitalization and frequent use of health services resources. Results show that 57% of infants born at &lt; 26 weeks (n=49) and 49% of those born at 26-29 weeks (n=205) were re-hospitalized, mostly for respiratory illness. Both groups used a significant amount of health resources: 61% vs. 59%, respectively, received physical or occupational therapy, 29% vs. 17%, respectively, required long-term rehabilitation, 38% vs. 28%, respectively, used prescribed medication, and 59% vs. 33%, respectively, required home medical equipment (home oxygen, apnea monitors, orthopaedic devices and visual aids). Risk of re-hospitalization was associated with severe brain injury, use of an apnea monitor, and older age at neonatal discharge. Multiple birth, severe brain injury, suspected neonatal sepsis, and single-parent household were independently associated with the risk of using health care services above average. These results highlight the importance of resource allocation to preterm infants for medical and rehabilitation services after discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit.</description><creator>Luu, Thuy-Mai.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Child Health Services -- utilization -- Quebec.</subject><subject>Infant, Premature -- Quebec.</subject><subject>Child Development -- Quebec.</subject><subject>Developmental Disabilities -- epidemiology -- Quebec.</subject><subject>Infant -- Quebec.</subject><title>Use of special health care services by infants born extremely prematurely in the province of Quebec</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qb98mj919.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z316q508z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xg94ht15j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:31:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In external electron beam therapy arbitrarily shaped inserts (cutouts) are used to define the contours of the irradiated field. This thesis describes the implementation and verification of a software system to calculate output factors for cutouts using Monte Carlo simulations. The design goals were: (1) A stand-alone software system running on a single workstation. (2) Task oriented graphical user interface with shape input capability. (3) Implementation on Mac OS XRTM (10A.x Tiger). (4) CPU multicore support by job splitting. (5) EGSnrc (Patch level V4-r2-2-5) for particle transport and dose scoring. (6) Validation for clinical use. The system, called Cutout Manager, can calculate output factors with 1% statistical error in 20 minutes on Mac Pro computer (Intel XeonRTM, 4 cores). When the BEAMnrc linac model correctly reproduces percentage depth doses in the buildup region and around R100, calculated and measured output factors are in good agreement with precision measurements of circular cutouts at 100 cm source-to-surface distance (SSD) and extended SSD. Cutout Manager simulations are consistent with measurements of clinical cutouts within a 2% error margin.</description><creator>Last, Jürgen.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Monte Carlo Method.</subject><subject>Particle Accelerators.</subject><subject>Software Design.</subject><subject>Radiotherapy, High-Energy -- instrumentation.</subject><subject>Radiosurgery -- instrumentation.</subject><title>Cutout Manager : a stand-alone software system to calculate output factors for arbitrarily shaped electron beams using Monte Carlo simulation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w0892f49f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94ht15j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7p88cm162</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:31:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Methionine dependence, the inability of cells to grow when the amino acid methionine is replaced in culture medium by its metabolic precursor homocysteine, is characteristic of many cancer cell lines. Most cells proliferate normally under these conditions. The methionine dependent tumorigenic human melanoma cell line MeWo-LC1 was derived from the methionine independent non-tumorigenic line MeWo. The MeWo-LC1 cell line has been shown to have a cellular phenotype similar to that of cells from patients with the cblC inborn error of cobalamin metabolism, with decreased synthesis of cobalamin coenzymes and decreased activity of the cobalamin dependent enzymes methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. Inability of cblC cells to complement the defect in cobalamin metabolism in MeWo-LC1 suggested that the defect was caused by decreased activity of the MMACHC gene product. However, no potentially disease causing mutations could be detected in the coding sequence of MMACHC in MeWo-LC1. No MMACHC expression could be detected in MeWo-LC1, and there was virtually complete methylation of a CpG island at the 5' end of the MMACHC gene in MeWo-LC1, consistent with inactivation of the gene by methylation; the CpG island was partially methylated in MeWo and only lightly methylated in control fibroblasts. Transfection of MeWo-LC1 with wild type MMACHC with a constitutive promoter resulted in correction of the defect in cobalamin metabolism and restoration of the ability of cells to grow in medium containing homocysteine. We conclude that epigenetic inactivation of the MMACHC gene is responsible for methionine dependence in MeWo-LC1.</description><creator>Loewy, Amanda Duvall, 1981-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Methionine -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Neoplasms -- pathology.</subject><subject>Carrier Proteins -- genetics.</subject><subject>Molecular Chaperones -- genetics.</subject><subject>Neoplasms -- genetics.</subject><subject>Epigenesis, Genetic.</subject><subject>Vitamin B 12 -- metabolism.</subject><title>Hypermethylation of the MMACHC promoter is associated with methionine dependence in the human malignant melanoma cell line Me-Wo-LC1</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j098zf623.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7p88cm162</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Human Genetics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q524js33w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:31:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Mitochondrial gene expression in trypanosomatid pathogens requires extensive post transcriptional modification called RNA editing. This unique molecular mechanism, catalyzed by a multiprotein complex (the editosome), generates translatable transcripts for essential components of parasite respiratory complex. How editosome proteins are assembled and perform RNA editing is not fully understood. Moreover, previous studies have shown that editosome proteins are essential for parasite survival, which makes editosome as a suitable target for drug discovery. Currently, researchers use radio-labeled based assays to monitor RNA editing process. However, these assays are not suitable for high throughput screening of editosome inhibitors, have low detection limits, and cannot monitor RNA editing in real time. Therefore, to develop a sensitive high throughput RNA editing assay, we have designed a sensitive hammerhead ribozyme-based fluorescence assay. Ribozyme structure was remodeled by adding or removing uridylate in its conserved catalytic core to make an inactive ribozyme. In the presence of the editosome, inactive ribozyme is edited to an active ribozyme. Consequently, hammerhead ribozyme activity can be measured by cleaving its fluorescently labeled substrate. We have shown that higher sensitivity is achieved using fluorescent based assay than conventional radio-labeled assay. Moreover, we can use this assay for rapid identification and characterization of the editosome inhibitors against RNA editing activities in trypanosomatids.</description><creator>Moshiri, Houta.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Fluorescence spectroscopy.</subject><subject>RNA editing.</subject><subject>Trypanosoma brucei -- Molecular genetics.</subject><subject>Fluorescent probes.</subject><subject>African trypanosomiasis.</subject><title>Fluorescence-based reporter substrate for monitoring RNA editing in Trypanosomatid pathogens</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x920g1303.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q524js33w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Parasitology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7m01bq07m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:31:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Although dynamic interactions between plant cells and their environment require adhesion between the cell wall (CW) and the plasma membrane (PM), few plant adhesion molecules have been identified. Therefore, the seed coat mucilage secretory cells (MSCs) of Arabidopsis thaliana (which undergo developmentally regulated changes in adhesion) were developed into a novel model system to study PM-CW adhesion. Twenty-seven candidate genes were identified using data from publicly available and seed-specific microarrays. Mutant plants for these genes were screened for defects in adhesion via plasmolysis, and for changes in MSC morphology that may result from defective adhesion (Chapter 1). Two fasciclin-like arabinogalactan proteins were isolated in this screen. One of these, SOS5, was characterized in detail (Chapter 2). sos5 mutants are sensitive to hyperosmotic conditions and show defects in PM-CW adhesion and MSC mucilage structure. Interestingly, these phenotypes may be attributed to defects in adhesion or to defects in cell wall deposition.</description><creator>McFarlane, Heather Elizabeth, 1983-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Arabinogalactan.</subject><subject>Cell adhesion molecules.</subject><subject>Plant cell membranes.</subject><subject>Plant cell walls.</subject><subject>Arabidopsis thaliana -- Molecular genetics.</subject><title>Isolation and characterization of SOS5 in a novel screen for plasma membrane to cell wall adhesion genes in Arabidopsis thaliana</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9z903345n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7m01bq07m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2r36v194h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:31:08Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis primarily discusses the results of two papers, [Hu] and [HaHu]. The first is an overview of algebraic-geometric techniques for integrable systems in which the AKS theorem is proven. Under certain conditions, this theorem asserts the commutatvity and (potential) non-triviality of the Hamiltonian flow of Ad*-invariant functions once they're restricted to subalgebras. This theorem is applied to the case of coadjoint orbits on loop algebras, identifying the flow with a spectral curve and a line bundle via the Lax equation. These results play an important role in the discussion of [HaHu], wherein we consider three levels of spaces, each possessing a linear family of Poisson spaces. It is shown that there exist Poisson mappings between these levels. We consider the two cases where the underlying Riemann surface is an elliptic curve, as well as its degeneration to a Riemann sphere with two points identified (the trigonometric case).

An optical parametric amplifier was constructed to be used as a pump source for the spectrometer. Using nonlinear optical processes and an 800 nm ultrashort pulses, tunable infrared(IR) light was produced with a wavelength range of ~.1 mum to 3 mum. The IR light was then mixed with 800 nm light to produce tunable visible light with a wavelength range of 466 nm to 600 nm. Supercontinuum (SC) was used as the probe pulse of the spectrometer, providing a large observation bandwidth. Commercially purchased fast spectrometers were used as the detection mechanism.

The main symptom cachexia, issues a loss of strength and impacts on an important aspect of QoL, physical function. Physical function is predominately assessed subjectively. Lately performance-based measures are gaining in popularity. One performance measure, the chair rise test, has not been validated in the NSCLC population and was the objective of this study. Subjects completed the chair rise test, 6MWT, hand grip, and the SF-36 pre and post chemotherapy.

Thirty children clinically diagnosed with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) aged 6-12 years were recruited through the ADHD Clinic and the Severe and Disruptive Behavior Disorders Program at the Douglas Mental Health University Institute. The three doses of MPH were administered according to a double blind randomized cross-over three day trial (0.3; 0.5 0.8 mg/kg/day in a bid schedule). An improvement across all three doses of MPH on motor, cognitive and behavioural measures was observed. The improvement is significant at low doses of MPH and an increase of dose up to 0.8 mg/kg/day does not lead to further improvement of the speed of simple motor task, but might be beneficial to specific cognitive tasks.

Estrogen-receptor related receptors (ERRs), which have no known natural ligands, are a family of orphan receptors consisting of 3 isoforms: ERRalpha, ERRbeta and ERRgamma. The ERRs have been shown to actively modulate estrogenic responses, to play an essential role in pregnancy, and are implicated in breast cancer prognosis. My results show that ED acts as an antagonist of the ERRalpha confirming preliminary results obtained by our group. Studies of cellular responses demonstrate that ED has strong anti-mitogenic properties. ED inhibited the growth of both estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (MCF-7) and ER-negative (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner but did not have any effects on the proliferation of the non-cancerous immortalized epithelial breast MCF-10A cells. The finding that ED inhibits proliferation of both ER negative and ER positive breast cancer cells, and regulate ERR transcriptional activity may have important ramifications in breast cancer therapy.</description><creator>Hébert-Losier, Andréa, 1983-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Receptors, Estrogen -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Breast Neoplasms -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Pregnancy -- blood.</subject><subject>Estrenes -- analysis.</subject><subject>Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin -- analysis.</subject><subject>Receptors, Estrogen -- antagonists &amp; inhibitors.</subject><subject>Estrogen Receptor alpha -- metabolism.</subject><title>Structural and functional characterization of a novel endogenous steroid, estradienolone (ED), in human pregnancy</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gm80j006z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/br86b6926</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Surgical Research</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8336h511r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:31:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a relatively common psychiatric disorder affecting 5-10% of child and 4% of the adult population. The disorder involves both behavioural problems and cognitive deficits, which are believed to be associated with neurological differences seen in this population. There has been increasing interest in understanding the cognitive deficits and neurological basis associated with ADHD. Neuropsychological examinations are an affordable tool, which can be used to improve our understanding of the cognitive deficits associated with the disorder and aid in clinical care. Currently, there is no standardized neuropsychological assessment that can be used in this population. In order to assist in developing a sound, predominately computerized test battery, which would assess deficits commonly seen in adults with ADHD, a neuropsychological project was piloted to examine recruitment and test utility. The majority of the tests were computerized and had population norms. The test battery was piloted on 8 patients on and off medication, and 4 patients completed the test battery twice off medication to examine potential practice effects. A discussion of feasibility and utility of the neuropsychological test battery for adults with ADHD ensues.</description><creator>Keller, Amanda.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity -- diagnosis.</subject><subject>Neuropsychological Tests.</subject><subject>Adult.</subject><title>Neuropsychological test battery for adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder : feasibility study</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gh93h3002.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8336h511r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychiatry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2514np82z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:31:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect (SZE) is a secondary distortion of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum produced by galaxy clusters that allows for measurements of intra-cluster gas properties. Current experiments are using large arrays of multiplexed transition-edge sensor bolometers to achieve the sensitivities required for SZE cluster surveys and targeted cluster SZE observations. This thesis describes the APEX-SZ experiment, the first instrument to produce scientific results from observations with such an array. The scientific motivation for the APEX-SZ experiment is discussed, followed by a description of the APEX-SZ experiment and frequency domain multiplexing technologies. We have developed a custom data reduction pipeline for the experiment which uses a variety of filters, both in the temporal and spatial domain to produce 1' resolution maps of the SZE at 150GHz. The results of data analysis for the Bullet cluster (lE0657-56) and Abell 2204 (A2204) are presented. Both clusters are assumed to be isothermal and in hydrostatic equilibrium, allowing a fit to an isothermal beta-model and subsequent mass fraction estimates. The maximum likelihood parameters and constant likelihood 68% confidence intervals are estimated using a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo method to sample the beta-model parameter space. We measure cluster gas mass fractions with r 2500 to be 0.140 +/- 0.035 and 0.058 +/- 0.035 for the Bullet cluster and A2204 respectively. The Bullet gas mass fraction is consistent with previous results from X-ray analysis. The gas mass fraction for A2204 does not agree well with other A2204 observations, however the large scatter in the gas mass fractions determined from previous X-ray and SZE analyses indicates that a more complex density model may be appropriate for this cluster.</description><creator>Kennedy, James, 1983-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Cosmic background radiation.</subject><subject>Bolometer.</subject><subject>Galaxies -- Clusters -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Galaxies -- Clusters.</subject><title>The APEX-SZ experiment : observations of the Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5d86p381x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2514np82z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mc87pv119</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:31:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this work, snow data, collected at the Centre for Atmospheric Research Experiments (CARE) site during the winter of 2005/06 as part of the Canadian CALIPSO/CloudSat Validation Project (C3VP) were analyzed with various goals in mind: 1) investigate the effects of surface temperature and system depth on the snow fall velocity and particle size distribution, 2) find the variables that control the relationships between snow fall velocity and size (control variables), 3) retrieve the coefficient and the exponent in the power-law mass-size relations used in snow reflectivity, 4) estimate vertical air motion and 5) describe the shape of snowflakes that can be used in polarimetric studies of snow. It also includes considerable calibration work on the Hydrometeor Velocity and Shape Detector (HVSD); as well as sensitivity testing for radar calibration and Mie-scattering effect on snow density. Snow events were classified into several categories according to the radar echo vertical extent (H), surface and echo top temperatures (T s, Tt), to find their effects on snow fall velocity and particle size distribution. Several case studies, including situations of strong turbulence, were also examined. Simple and multiple correlation analyses between control variables and parameters of the power-law size-velocity relationship were carried out for 13 snow cases having a high R2 between their mean snowflakes fall velocity and the v-D fitted curve, in order to find the control variables of power-law v-D relations. Those cases were all characterized by single layered precipitation with different echo depth, surface and echo top temperatures. Results show that the exponent "b" in v-D power-law relationship has little effect on the variability of snow fall velocity; all control variables (T s, Tt, H) correlate much better to the coefficient "a" than to the exponent "b", leading to a snow fall velocity that can be simulated with a varying coefficient "a" and a fixed exponent "b" (v=aD0.15) with good accuracy. Coefficient "a" and exponent "b" for a generic snow v-D relationship were also examined. The results indicate that coefficient "a" of generic snow represents the most frequent coefficient "a" during the events, while the exponent "b" does not show any representative. Retrieval of the coefficient "a" and exponent "b" in a power-law mass-size relation, which eventually affects the snow reflectivity, was conducted by minimizing the root mean square (RMS) of differences in reflectivity between Vertically pointing McGill X-band Radar (VertiX) and HVSD. Minima of reflectivity differences lay on a diagonal direction of a diagram of the coefficient "a" (x-axis) versus exponent "b" (y-axis). It is shown that as the system deepens, the slope gets less steep. In addition, coefficient and exponent for this mass-size relation change with time, and snow density derived from several combined snow events does not explain the average snow density of the period. A method to retrieve vertical air motion with good accuracy using VertiX and HVSD is suggested. Several snow shape parameters and relations between the area ratio (Ar) and size of snowflakes (Ar-D relation) are investigated with snow dimensions defined in various ways. These Ar-D relations will be used as a guideline in snow density models.</description><creator>Jung, EunSil.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Snowflakes -- Ontario.</subject><subject>Snow -- Ontario.</subject><subject>Centre for Atmospheric Research Experiments (Canada)</subject><title>Snow study at Centre for Atmospheric Research Experiments : variability of snow fall velocity, density and shape</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d217qt37v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mc87pv119</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2514np837</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:31:14Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Papanicolaou Smear is a screening test which detects premalignant lesions of the uterine cervix. By treating these lesions, cervical cancer can be evaded. In 1988, a cytological diagnosis which communicated a state of uncertainty in the atypicality of cervical cells was first created in the Bethesda Cytology Classification scheme. This diagnosis is now known as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and still little is known about its natural history. This paper analyzes the results of a longitudinal study incorporating repeated regular measurements of viral and cytological endpoints as well as lifestyle and behavioural aspects, to understand the natural history of an ASC-US Pap smear and identify determinants of ASC-US acquisition and clearance. Overall, the median duration of ASC-US is short, and is dependent on the definition of clearance since most lesions regress to normal. The factors most predictive of ASC-US acquisition but not clearance relate to HPV infection.</description><creator>Lau, Susie Kit Sze.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Precancerous Conditions -- pathology.</subject><subject>Vaginal Smears.</subject><subject>Uterine Cervical Neoplasms -- epidemiology.</subject><subject>Papillomavirus Infections -- complications.</subject><subject>Longitudinal Studies.</subject><subject>Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia -- epidemiology.</subject><title>Epidemiology and correlates of acquisition and clearance of ASC-US cytological abnormalities</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p2677021c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2514np837</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k0698c160</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:31:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Objectives: To identify correlates of psychological distress and to investigate how coping skills, anxiety and depression are related in a group of head and neck cancer patients 6-12 months after their diagnosis. Methods: We evaluated in 107 head and neck cancer patients their anxiety and depression levels using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and their Coping strategies using the Ways of Coping Checklist. Results: There were statistically significant associations between gender and anxiety level, and between living arrangements, cancer site, time since treatment, tumor stage and depressive symptoms. Results also showed that patients used a variety of coping strategies. Different coping strategies were used in subjects with high versus those with low levels of anxiety or depressive symptoms.

Migraine has a global prevalence of 10%, and it is a disorder with elevated direct and indirect costs, the later mostly derived from its association with mood and anxiety disorders. Specifically, the reported prevalence of migraine in the BD population ranges from 24.8% to 39.8%, rates that are considerable higher than those found in the general population. Objective: To explore the prevalence and clinical characteristics of BD patients with and without migraine (Study 1), and to examine the psychiatric comorbidity in patients suffering from migraine (Study 2). Methods: 323 BD patients were studied, using SADS-L and SCID as diagnostic interviews, and ill-Migraine questionnaire to assess the presence of migraine. Statistical analyses were conducted using parametric analysis and the development of log-linear models. Additionally, 102 migraine patients were interviewed using SADS-L, and the descriptive characteristics of the sample were analyzed. Results: For Study 1, we found that 24.5% of BD patients suffer from migraine, and it is significantly associated with BD 2, suicidal behaviour, and a variety of anxiety disorders. As well, over 70% of migraine patients showed a lifetime psychiatric diagnosis, mainly within the spheres of mood and anxiety disorders; specifically, the prevalence of BD among migraine patients was 12.7%. Conclusions: Our study highlights the high prevalence of migraine among BD patients, and the elevated prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity among migraine sufferers. The study of this comorbidity will deepen our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie both disorders and provide a better framework for the developing of molecular techniques to further analyze the molecular physiopathology of Bipolar Disorder.</description><creator>Ortiz-Dominguez, Tania Abigail.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Migraine Disorders -- epidemiology.</subject><subject>Comorbidity.</subject><subject>Bipolar Disorder -- epidemiology.</subject><subject>Canada -- epidemiology</subject><title>Migraine comorbidity in bipolar disorder</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4j03d346z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b8515r82f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychiatry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):15025</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
