The word to be categorized was either a member of the category, a homophone of the member (Homophone foil-HF) or orthographically similar to the member (Spelling control-SC). In one condition, the categorization task was presented with no context and in another it was preceded by a sentence context. Hearing readers made more errors on HFs than SCs in both conditions providing evidence for the use of phonology. However this was limited to low frequency items. Good hearing-impaired readers did not show phonological effects in either condition, while poor hearing-impaired readers showed a phonological effect in the context condition. Results are discussed in light of theoretical and practical implications.</description><creator>Nemeth-Sinclair, Susan</creator><contributor>Waters, Gloria (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Education, Reading.</subject><title>The role of phonology and context in word recognition : a comparison of hearing-impaired and hearing readers</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xk81jm26p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x633f2053</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Human Communication Disorders</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:dz010q92j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:52:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A key problem in the interpretation of visual form is the partitioning of a shape into principal components that correspond to the parts of an object. This thesis presents a method for partitioning a set of surface estimates obtained with a laser range finding system into subsets corresponding to such parts. The strategy employed makes use of two complementary representations for surfaces: one that describes local structures in terms of differential properties (e.g. edges, lines, contours) and the other that represents the surface as a collection of smooth patches at different scales. It is shown that by enforcing a consistent interpretation between these two representations, it is possible to derive a partitioning algorithm that is both efficient and robust. Examples of its performance on a set of range images are presented.</description><creator>Lejeune, André</creator><contributor>Ferrie, Frank P.

In 1827 Kireevsky declared his intention of giving his own direction to Russian letters through criticism, a genre he helped create in Russia. The working out of the principal attributes of the narodnost' conceptual variable, key to his time, is a constant in all his articles. Also pervasive are his several professional deficiencies. These did not hinder his contemporaries' true and often stated appreciation of his contribution but for the modern student they seriously impede comprehension. Nevertheless, the Russia/West dynamic is a clearly discernible constant, constituting an integral part of his understanding of narodnost'. He persistently attempts to get around the West's cultural superiority but varies his tactical approach to the problem somewhat each time. It is the aim of the present study to follow and document the evolution of his thought on these related phenomena while concurrently dealing with the impact of his professional shortcomings.</description><creator>Bonneville, Gérard Léo</creator><contributor>Austin, P.

The analytical methods used draw significantly upon previous work done by Varvara Dernova, as well as some of the concepts of Manfred Kelkel. The thesis presents a qualified vindication of the structural importance of the quartal spacing in Scriabin's harmonic language. (This characteristic feature of the composer's pitch organization tends to be regarded by most contemporary theorists as merely an idiomatic spacing that the composer favoured.) The thesis proposes that a structural, ten-note, harmonic matrix (formed through the summation of the octatonic and whole-tone scales) is the key to an understanding of the harmonic language in Scriabin's final works. Graphic illustrations are an important feature of the various analyses presented; these depict both horizontal and vertical aspects of Scriabin' s musical language in his final works, specifically, selections from the piano compositions op.71-74. The analyses also present an evaluation of the importance of the octatonic scale, believed by George Perle, Jay Reise, and Claude Herndon, among other theorists, to be the structural matrix in the late Scriabin oeuvre.</description><creator>Shergold, Roderick</creator><contributor>Cherney, Brian (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Scriabin, Aleksandr Nikolayevich, 1872-1915 -- Harmony</subject><title>Harmony and voice leading in late Scriabin</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3x816n34q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tt44pn75w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ng451j36k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:52:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis studies the way in which Robert Soulieres uses, in increasing complexity, four forms of humour in his novels for adolescents. The novels studied are: Le visiteur du soir, Un ete sur le Richelieu, Casse-tete chinois, and Ciel d'Afrique et pattes de gazelle. These forms of humour are defined, identified, and classified. How they are used and interact with other components of the works are examined. The thesis is divided into four chapters. The first looks at the way in which the author manipulates language. The second analyses the role of the narrator and the different narrative levels. The third section scrutinizes discursive intertextuality and literary styles, while the final chapter focuses on visual plays. The latter includes the use of original typographical characters and unusual formatting. In studying these aspects of the novels, it becomes apparent that the author uses them to establish and maintain contact with his young readers.</description><creator>Lafleur, Sylvie</creator><contributor>Desrosiers-Bonin, Diane (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Soulières, Robert -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><title>Procédés humoristiques dans l'oeuvre romanesque de Robert Soulières</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q237hs69d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ng451j36k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7d278t88q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:52:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is a study of the Muslim woman saint and mystic, Rabi'ah al-'Adawiyah, as envisioned by her main biographer, Farid al-Din 'Attar. Part I is a brief review of previous works and scholarship in order to situate Rabi'ah within an historical context and to judge the consistency of earlier interpretation with the actual source material concerning Rabi'ah, 'Attar's account in particular. Part II is an exploration of 'Attar's image of Rabi'ah, based on his Tadhkirat al-awliya' and complemented by related material from his poetical works. This discussion is presented according to three themes, 'Attar's understanding of Rabi'ah as a mystic, a Muslim and a woman: the three themes from which 'Attar draws to express some aspect of Rabi'ah's spiritual personality, or to manifest, in outward form, the paradox of her inner mystical secret.</description><creator>Helms, Barbara Lois</creator><contributor>Landolt, Hermann A.

Although this crop is grown extensively in organic soils, few studies have been conducted on these. Onion plants (Allium cepa L. cv. Norstar) were inoculated with Glomus aggregatum Schenck &amp; Smith, Glomus clarum Nicolson &amp; Schenck, Glomus fasciculatum Gerdemann &amp; Trappe, Glomus intraradix Schenck &amp; Smith and Glomus versiforme (Karst.) Berch and grown in the field and under controlled conditions to evaluate their efficiency in newly reclaimed organic soil of low P fertility. Three species were selected to evaluate the effects of introduced endomycorrhizal fungi effects and P fertilization (equivalent to 0, 24 and 48 kg P ha$ sp{-1}$) on the growth and mineral nutrition of onion plants. Introducing endomycorrhizal fungi in non-sterile soil did not affect the growth and mineral nutrition of onion. Crop maturity was advanced when plants were inoculated, however. Increasing levels of P fertilization did not depress root colonization and onion growth was increased significantly at the highest rate only. These results suggest that higher levels than recommended could be used in this soil. Inoculation in $ gamma$-irradiated (10 kGy, $ sp{60}$Co) soil alleviated excessive Mn absorption by onion plants. Adding P fertilizer depressed growth and root colonization when plants were inoculated with G. clarum and G. intraradix and was related to the low irradiance levels used in this study. G. versiforme appeared to be the most efficient of the introduced species.</description><creator>Grenier, Aline M.</creator><contributor>Stewart, Katrine A.

Until recently however, race as a unique category for theoretical investigation has remained largely unexplored. The author here outlines how both a variety of theoretical disscussions about race and ethnicity, about difference, and about experience, have formed the basis of how race is currently talked about in postmodernist discourse and how these various postmodernist discussions about race and difference may both enrich and be enriched by a theoretical examination of French poststructuralist theory. Employing the popular Benetton ads as a vehicle for theorizing a common ground between postmodernist and poststructuralist theory, the author argues that current theoretical discourse must reconceptualize not so much the multiple and varied definitions of "race" by which it has tried to account for the experiences of non-white subjects worldwide, but the very grounds upon which those definitions have been constructed. Race can no longer be thought of as a collective identity predicated on biological similarities but must be re-thought in terms of a transformational metaphor, a multivocal sign for political solidarity and alliance among dispersed groups of people sharing common historical experiences of discrimination and oppression. On this note, the author will herein argue that the naturalized connotations of race must be disarticulated out of racial discourse and rearticulated in such a way as to emphasize race as a contingent, multi-accentual signifier constructed out of varying social and political practices.</description><creator>Yamashita, Miyo</creator><contributor>Kaite, Berkeley (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Mass media and race relations</subject><title>United controversies of Benetton : rethinking race in light of French poststructuralist theory and postmodernism</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7d278t890.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vq27zp20x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Graduate Communications Program</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5425kb60s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:52:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In consideration of the chronic poverty of farmers in Rwanda as well as in other developing countries where self-sufficient agriculture is practiced, this study examines what the well studied theory of specialization and trade, if implemented, could bring to Rwandan farmers in terms of production and profits. To attain this objective, a spatial optimization model with linear programming was built and used to maximize the potential production and net returns which were compared to those from the traditional system. The model was built in a way that it also shows the pattern of trade and quantities traded. The results show that a regional specialization system would allow, on the national level, more production, higher net returns, and more trade than the traditional system (self-sufficient agriculture) as expected according to the theory of specialization and trade. Nevertheless, the net return in some regions decreases in the new system, which necessitates a compensation plan for those regions. However, it has to be noted that despite these gains, the adoption of the new plans requires a consideration of many other factors that are not covered in this study. Of those factors, the most obvious are the need to improve the transportation and marketing infrastructure, changing farmers' attitudes and objectives towards commercial agriculture, and securing equity, security, and sustainability in the system.</description><creator>Hitayezu, Felix</creator><contributor>Coffin, Garth (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Agriculture -- Economic aspects -- Rwanda.</subject><subject>Cropping systems -- Rwanda.</subject><subject>Agricultural productivity -- Rwanda.</subject><title>Farm income effects of regional crop specilization in Rwanda</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/np193986b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5425kb60s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Agricultural Economics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vd66w075p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:52:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis analyses the legal consequences that space manufacturers face, should their items be defective or should they do not function as intended.
