Two teachers and a total of 101  kindergarteners from a private kindergarten located in Taipei, the capital city of  Taiwan, were chosen for this study. Both qualitative and quantitative data were  gathered in the form of classroom observations and student and teacher interviews.  This analysis revealed that format was the literary element that students responded  to the most. However, factors such as the variance in the students' cognitive level,  age, exposure to the target language, teaching method and personality may have  affected the results. Consequently, teachers need to take into consideration other  literary elements when it comes to storybook selection. Results from this study can  be used firstly in developing criteria on how to select storybooks for young EFL  learners and how these storybooks can be integrated into the EFL classroom.  Secondly, this study can provide information to help further our understanding of  how stories motivate children in learning languages, and how stories can be  integrated into the EFL classroom. Thirdly, the data from this study can be useful  to writers and illustrators of children's books. Finally, it is hoped that this  project can also inspire other researchers in pursuing this topic for further  study.</description><creator>David, Elisa H.</creator><contributor>Turner, Carolyn (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>English language -- Study and teaching (Preschool) -- Taiwan -- Taipei</subject><subject>Children's stories</subject><subject>English language -- Study and teaching -- Chinese speakers</subject><title>What's the story? : storybooks in the EFL classrooms</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dv13zt93f.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/js956g451</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Integrated Studies in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3n203z74q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Recent work in anthropology has speculated on how developments  in molecular biology and medicine might bring about new bodies, selves, and forms of  sociality. This thesis explores how herbal and pharmaceutical antidepressants  differently affect experiences of one's neurochemistry. It does so in two ways.  First, it outlines the historical 'social life' of pharmaceutical antidepressants,  including their co-production with depression, and the neurochemical body in a  particular style of reasoning in biological psychiatry. Second, it presents and  analyzes claims made for the efficacy of antidepressants made in vernacular North  American books, advertisements, and pamphlets. Although the claims for both herbal  and pharmaceutical antidepressants allude to the same realms of value---those of  science, nature/history, and personal experience---their different social lives  enable different access to the neurochemical body.</description><creator>Cuffe, Jennifer</creator><contributor>Young, Allan (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Antidepressants -- Social aspects</subject><subject>Antidepressants -- Canada</subject><title>A rhetorical tale : neurochemistry and the efficacies of antidepressants in Canada</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kh04dq29j.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3n203z74q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anthropology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xd07gt27h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The main objective of this study was to investigate whether  parental perceptions of the emotional, behavioral and social skills functioning of  children with conduct problems, differed for parents who completed the behavioral  consultation process (N = 40) compared to those who prematurely withdrew ( N = 11).  A series of between group analyses were conducted to examine whether parental  perceptions existed. Parents who prematurely withdrew from the behavioral  consultation process reported significantly greater incidences of anxious and  depressed behavior in children, than parents who remained in consultation F(1,49) =  4.24, p = .0448. Similarly, using the Wilks' criterion, overall estimates of  emotional and behavioral functioning, combined with social skills functioning were  also significantly affected by group membership, F(3,47) = 3.22, p = .0310. Using  the same variables in a logistic regression analysis, a test of the full model with  all three predictors compared to the constant only model was statistically reliable  phi2 (3, N = 51) = 10.26, p = .0336, indicating that the predictors, as a set,  reliably distinguished the perceptions of those who completed the consultation  process, compared to those who prematurely withdrew. This model accurately predicted  77.7% of parents' group membership. The results of the study will be discussed in  terms of their usefulness for future consultants to identify families at risk for  prematurely withdrawing from the consultation process, so that additional resources  can be offered to encourage their continued participation in the consultation  process.</description><creator>Blidner, Aron</creator><contributor>Sladeczek, I.

The thesis concentrates on the writings of several of the most  important intellectuals of the XVIII century who took part in the heated debate as  to the value of Calderon's work: Blas Nasarre y Ferriz, Tomas Erauso y Zabaleta,  Nicolas Fernandez de Moratin, Cristobal Romea y Tapia, Jose Clavijo y Fajardo and  Francisco Mariano Nipho. The first two chapters of the thesis deal with the way by which  the image of Calderon has been used in order to support certain ideological  convictions, in particular, a certain way of understanding Spanish national  identity. Chapter three examines the polemics itself, from its beginning in 1749  until the mid-sixties of the XVIII century. A brief section of conclusions closes  the thesis, followed by a selected bibliography.</description><creator>Bezhanova, Olga</creator><contributor>Perez-Magallon, Jesus (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>National characteristics, Spanish -- History</subject><subject>Spain -- Intellectual life -- 18th century</subject><subject>Calderón de la Barca, Pedro, 1600-1681 -- Appreciation</subject><title>Calderón y la identidad nacional en la ilustración</title><language>spa</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4t64gn89q.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rb68xc42m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Hispanic Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:41687j04j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>When a detonation propagates in an explosive that partially  fills a channel, a shock wave can be generated in the air gap between the explosive  and its confinement. This is typically referred to as the channel effect. In the air  gap, the detonation products behave as a piston, which drives the precursor air  shock wave ahead of the detonation. Since the shock wave runs ahead of the  detonation, it preconditions the explosive and the detonation propagates into  shocked explosive. This can affect the detonation in various ways, depending on the  nature of the explosive. Properties such as heterogeneity, porosity and sensitivity  of the explosive will determine how the precursor shock will affect the detonation  propagation. Four different coupling mechanisms have been identified and are  discussed in this thesis. They have been called: precompression, detonation  initiation, surface ignition and dead pressing. In the present study, three cases are investigated  experimentally: precompression, detonation initiation and the case where no coupling  occurs. The goal is to elucidate the respective propagation mechanisms. It is found  that boundary layers on the channel walls significantly affect the precursor shock  wave propagation. This effect is modeled and the results are compared to  experiments. When the explosive is PETN powder, the detonation is found to  accelerate to 1.5 times the Chapman-Jouguet velocity. Experiments performed indicate  that this is due to precompression of the PETN. Again this effect is modeled and  compared with experiments. It is also demonstrated that in the present experiments,  coupling via initiation does not occur. However, experiments were performed to  determine why the explosive is not initiated by the precursor shock wave. It is  found that the initiation delay for the strength of precursor shock generated is  simply too long for any coupling to occur.</description><creator>Tanguay, Vincent, 1977-</creator><contributor>Higgins, Andrew J.

First-order linear piston theory is  used to model the aerodynamic loads, and von Karman plate theory is applied to model  the structural non-linearity. The panel is shown to be very rich in dynamics,  including stable flat/buckled state, limit cycle oscillation, and chaos. The  complexity of the dynamics of the panel is presented in a diagram of stability  regions, Lyapunov exponents and two bifurcation diagrams with respect to the  in-plane load and the flow velocity. Several new phenomena have been observed,  including the co-existence of multiple symmetric limit cycles and the pairing of  asymmetric limit cycles. Moreover, reduced order models of the aeroelastic system  are constructed by means of proper orthogonal decomposition. The performance of the  reduced order models with a striking low dimensionality is tested, and the reduced  order models are shown to be accurate and robust for predicting the dynamics of the  aeroelastic system.</description><creator>Tang, Liaosha, 1970-</creator><contributor>Epureanu, B.

This thesis explores the design,  implementation and characterization of a two-dimensional optical wavelength  (de)multiplexer designed to interface between wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)  optical networks and 2D micro-mirror optical switch, VCSEL or detector arrays. The  system uses multifacet gratings to map the light from a traditional optical  (de)multiplexer to a 4 x 16 array with a pitch of 250 mum. The device is 6.05 mm in  length and could be fabricated by plastic injection molding. The device successfully  performs the two-dimensional mapping. The average efficiency for the device was  measured to be 10.4%. The thesis ends with a list of future work that can be done to  improve both the theoretical and practical efficiency of the device.</description><creator>Thomas-Dupuis, Frédéric</creator><contributor>Kirk, Andrew G.

Oxygen  limitation was found to decrease sophorolipid production in this system.  Partitioning experiments with sophorolipid revealed that the surfactant increases  the affinity of oleic acid for the aqueous phase of a two phase system. C. bombicola  therefore has potential applications in the remediation of pulp and paper effluent  containing recalcitrant long-chain fatty acids; both for its ability to degrade the  acids and for the tendency of sophorolipid to make fatty acids more bioavailable to  organisms involved in downstream activated sludge treatment. A novel capillary gas  chromatography method was developed to rapidly and quantitatively analyze long-chain  fatty acids.</description><creator>Marin, Joseph R.</creator><contributor>Cooper, D.

The one-dimensional sedimentation  dispersion model provides a relationship between mixing parameters and the solids  concentration gradient. An investigation of the relationship between the solid  mixing properties and the solids residence time distribution, as derived from the  sedimentation dispersion model has been conducted. Experimental results show that  the solids residence time distribution was a function of particle size and differed  from that for the liquid phase. An empirical correlation for the solids Peclet  number to predict the residence time distribution of the particles is proposed. A  single parameter model to predict the solids residence time distribution as a  function of particle size is presented. The influence of the particle concentration  gradient on the mean conversion obtained in the reactor for two different cases is  examined.</description><creator>Murphy, Terry, 1955-</creator><date>2002</date><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Residence time distribution of solid particles in a CSTR</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gx41mj697.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j098zb67v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2b88qc78g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:14Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The effect of Si addition on the interaction between  recrystallization and precipitation during multipass deformation has been  investigated in terms of the no-recrystallization temperature (Tnr), the minimum  temperature at which recrystallization can be completed. The Tnr was measured in  three Nb microalloyed steels with Si concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 0.48wt.%.  Continuous cooling conditions were employed, with interpass times of 20--200s and  strains of 0.2 and 0.35 applied at a strain rate of 2s -1. It was observed that for similar Nb contents, the Tnr increased  with Si level, but appeared to saturate at long interpass times. In addition, high  strains also reduced the influence of Si on the Tnr. This behaviour can be  attributed to the acceleration of the Nb(C,N) precipitation kinetics by the addition  of Si. With increasing interpass time or strain, the precipitates start to coarsen  and, in consequence, the pinning effect due to precipitation is reduced. Therefore,  under these conditions, the effectiveness of Si addition in raising the Tnr is  diminished.</description><creator>Jiang, Lan, 1970-</creator><contributor>Jonas, John J.

To study the behaviour of the reactor wall, three of the  specimens were tested under axial tension, while the other three were tested in  flexure. The specimens were subjected to cyclic loads, strains, and a combination of  loads and strains, equivalent to 25 and 50 years in the life of the actual  structure. The stiffness of the specimen and the cracks on the specimen were  monitored. The test results confirmed that the largest increases in crack  widths and the largest drop in stiffness occurred in the cycling that would be  equivalent to the first 25 years of the structure's service life. Proposed  procedures are given to determine the responses of the tension and bending specimens  for monotonic loading, after the equivalent of 25 years, and after the equivalent of  50 years. The influence of cycling was accounted for by determining suitable tension  stiffening factors, as a function of the number of cycles of loading and the level  of tensile strain.</description><creator>Hunzinger, Cindy M.</creator><contributor>Mitchell, D.

Hot-wire anemometry and cold-wire thermometry are used to measure  simultaneously the velocity and thermal fields, respectively. A mandoline is used to  (slightly) heat the wake. The injection ratio is varied in two ways. The velocity integral  scale at the injection point is varied by changing the mandoline downstream  position. Increasing the velocity scale, ℓ₀ (i.e., increasing the mandoline  downstream position), increases the rate at which the scalar variance decays and  reduces the integral length scale of the scalar. The time scale ratio (r =  (〈q²〉/ε)/(〈θ²〉/εθ))  decreases with increasing ℓ₀, in agreement with experiments done in  homogeneous and isotropic turbulence. The scalar injection scale is varied by changing the width, w,  of the mandoline. Increasing w decreases the decay rate of the scalar variance,  which is analogous to increasing the wire spacing in grid-generated turbulence. The  integral length scale of the scalar field (both longitudinal and transverse) and the  time scale ratio are, however, not affected by w, in contrast with experiments done  in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence.</description><creator>Beaulac, Sébastien</creator><contributor>Mydlarski, Laurent B.

Tests of the adherence of growing cultures to hydrocarbon substrates showed  differences between Cereclor S52 and a readily degradable chlorinated alkane,  1,10-dichlorodecane (DCD). In the bioreactor, Cereclor S52 was degraded by up to 73%  by means of multiple additions of DCD. This is indicative of an upper limit for the  degradation of Cereclor S52 in this system. The degradative enzymes in Pseudomonas  sp. 273 did not appear to be induced by Cereclor itself, by yeast extract, or by  hexadecane. The work suggests that DCD acted to induce degradative enzymes, as a  cosubstrate, and as a solvent to improve the bioavailability of Cereclor S52 in the  bioreactor.</description><creator>Bratty, Michael</creator><contributor>Brown, Wayne (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Maximizing biodegradation of chlorinated paraffins in a cyclic batch bioreactor</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sq87bv21p.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pk02cb46q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8w32r626t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The relationships between local and catchment-wide land use  patterns and the spatial distribution of stream habitat variables within the Grande  Cascapedia drainage basin were investigated using a geographic information system  (GIS). Stream habitat variables including substrate composition and channel  morphology were sampled at 48 study sites, ranging from highly disturbed to  relatively pristine forest conditions in 2nd to 5th order tributaries. Land use and  geology-structure variables were extracted for each catchment at four spatial scales  using a GIS. The transition between pool-riffle and boulder-rapid morphologies  occurred between channel gradients of 1.5% and 1.7%. The surface grainsize  distribution is affected by the hydraulic power of the reach, while the subsurface  grainsize distribution is associated with the degree of valley incision. The amount  of logging within a 1 km radius of a sample site increases the occurrence of fine  sediment within the substrate. There was, however, a surprising lack of relationship  between the majority of road density metrics and the level of fines within the  substrate.</description><creator>Wilson, Leah, 1977-</creator><contributor>Lapointe, Michel (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Atlantic salmon -- Effect of logging on -- Québec (Province) -- Cascapédia River Watershed</subject><subject>Logging -- Environmental aspects -- Québec (Province) -- Cascapédia River Watershed</subject><subject>Atlantic salmon -- Habitat -- Québec (Province) -- Cascapédia River Watershed</subject><title>Analysis of Atlantic salmon habitat distribution and sensitivity to forest extraction in the Cascapédia River drainage basin using a GIS</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xp68kh03w.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8w32r626t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:c534fp56t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Resistance to ivermectin (IVM) in Haemonchus contortus has  developed in many countries and its mechanism is still under investigation.  P-glycoproteins (P-gp) are transmembrane proteins that can transport drugs out of  cells. Researchers have found that there is polymorphism in a P-gp gene from H.  contortus between IVM-selected and unselected worms. Three main P-gp polymorphs were  identified, polymorph A was found to be related to IVM selection, while polymorphs B  and X were associated with susceptibility. The purpose of this research is to  investigate the genetic variations in P-glycoprotein that are associated with IVM  selection or susceptibility in H. contortus. Total RNA and genomic DNA were  extracted from individual male adult worms of IVM-selected and unselected strains of  H. contortus. A fragment of the P-gp gene was amplified from the genomic DNA of  individual worms and RFLP analysis was performed on the PCR product to genotype the  corresponding worms. The homozygous worms that possessed polymorph A, B or X were  identified.</description><creator>Wang, Guanhua, 1970-</creator><contributor>Beech, Robin (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Prichard, Roger (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Drug resistance.</subject><subject>Haemonchus contortus.</subject><subject>P-glycoprotein.</subject><subject>Ivermectin.</subject><title>Genetic variation in P-glycoprotein in Haemonchus contortus following ivermectin selection</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9p290b08d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fp56t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Parasitology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:r207tp95p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>PTP-sigma, a developmentally regulated receptor protein tyrosine  phosphatase of the LAR family, is highly expressed in the nervous system and is  involved in axon guidance. In this study, two potential substrates of PTP-sigma have  been detected by substrate trapping and two-dimensional electrophoresis. In  addition, an expression pattern of PTP-sigma in adult non-neural mouse tissues has  been established and opens new research avenues for the function of PTP-sigma. The  high levels of PTP-sigma in fat led us to look into a possible role for this enzyme  in insulin signaling. Insulin stimulated PTP-sigma knockout adipose tissue showed an  hyperphosphorylation of the insulin receptor (IR). GH-deficiency is predominantly  responsible for glucose homeostasis defects of PTP-sigma knockout mice and could  mask the effect of the absence of PTP-sigma in insulin signaling in vivo. To  overcome this, adipocytes were isolated. Upon insulin stimulation of PTP-sigma  knockout adipocytes, an increase in IR and a decrease in Akt phosphorylation were  observed, suggesting that the IR could be a substrate of PTP-sigma and that  PTP-sigma could be involved in the regulation of the activation of Akt. The  elucidation of the mechanisms of action of PTP-sigma in insulin signaling may lead  to the development of new treatments in diabetes and obesity.</description><creator>Thibault, Stéphanie</creator><contributor>Tremblay, Michel L.

In the  nervous system of the marine mollusk Aplysia, there are only two major PKC isoforms,  the calcium-activated PKC Apl I and the calcium-independent PKC Apl II, and both  PKCs are persistently activated during intermediate memory. We monitored the  PDK-dependent phosphorylation of PKC Apl I and PKC Apl II using phosphopeptide  antibodies. PDK phosphorylation of PKCs was not sensitive to inhibitors of PI-3  kinase, PKC, nor to expression of a kinase-inactive PDK. Phosphorylation of a kinase  inactive PKC was reduced, likely due to dephosphorylation. Localization of  PDK-phosphorylated PKC Apl II using immunocytochemistry revealed an enrichment of  phosphorylated PKC Apl II at the plasma membrane. These data suggest that increased  PDK phosphorylation of PKC Apl II is important for persistent kinase activation. PKC  phosphorylation at the PDK site is not affected by the presence of a kinase-inactive  form of PDK. Using GFP (green fluorescent protein)-tagged PKC, which was  microinjected into neurons, we determined that PKC was translocated to the  juxta-membrane region by the PKC activator 4beta-phorbol ester 12,13-dibutyrate  (PDBu).</description><creator>Thibault, Ginette</creator><contributor>Sossin, Wayne (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Characterization of the phosphorylation of protein kinase C by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zs25x9263.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zw12z592q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kh04dq31k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The enzyme chitin deacetylase was extracted from the fungus  Mucor rouxii. The fungus was grown aerobically at pH 4.5, and a temperature of 28  +/- 2°C, using a shaker speed of 100 rpm. The highest enzymatic activity was  obtained at 36 h of Mucor rouxii's growth. The protein content of Mucor rouxii was a  function of incubation time and it increased in the course of the fungal growth up  to 3 days. The enzyme was partial purified by ammonium sulfate  fractionation, followed by ion exchange chromatography using a Fast Protein Liquid  Chromatography (FPLC) System. The specific activity in the 60--85% ammonium sulfate  fraction showed higher specific activity (51.44 U/mg) and a 2.2-fold purification as  compared with that of the crude extract (24.27 U/mg). The fraction after ion  exchange chromatography step showed a specific activity of 233.65 U/mg, representing  about 7.2-fold purification compared to the crude extract. This ion exchange  fraction showed protein bands with molecular weights ranging from 45 to 75 kDa on  SDS-PAGE (12%). The enzyme showed optimal activity at a temperature of  50°C, and more than 90% of its activity was retained after 30 min incubation  at this temperature. The optimal pH activity of chitin deacetylase from Mucor rouxii  ranged from 5.5--6. The enzyme retained more than 80% of its activity in the pH  range of 4.5--8.5 after 1 h incubation at room temperature, suggesting that this  enzyme is quite stable in the slightly acidic to alkaline pH range. However, a lower  pH (&lt;4) and a higher pH (&gt;9) caused the enzyme to lose more than 60% of  its activity. It was shown that the chitin deacetylase did not require the  following metal ions (Co+2 and Mn+2) for activity. However, Mn+2 slightly increased  the enzyme activity. The activity of the enzyme was also inhibited by  EDTA.</description><creator>Soltani, Sahel</creator><contributor>Simpson, B. K.

Furthermore, dominance variance should be present to a greater degree in  traits closer to fitness (Crnokrak and Roff 1995). This study uses diallel cross  analyses of inbred lines of the sand cricket Gryllus firmus, to examine the sources  of variation in weight at age, adult size, development time, fecundity and flight  muscle weight and in particular the ratios of additive, dominance and maternal  variance to total variance.

One of the most studied in-cloud processes is the aqueous-phase  oxidation of sulfur IV into sulfate. From previous studies, large observed  concentration of sulfate species resulting from sulfur IV oxidation in the  atmosphere during the late fall and winter are still unexplained. Ariya found that  ozonolysis of alkenes can be an additional source of oxidant in the  gasphase. In this project, we assessed the effect of ozonolysis of alkenes  on in-cloud sulfur chemistry. We used a tropospheric chemistry box-model called  MOCCA (Model of Chemistry Considering Aerosols) coupled with a simple cloud droplet  model in the presence and absence of ozonolysis. The results obtained reinforce the  hypothesis that ozonolysis of alkenes can play a role in the sulfate production in  cloud droplets. In fact, we observed that ozonolysis could, in a situation of a high  pH, slow down the in-cloud oxidation and can possibly lead to an overall negative  impact on the in-cloud sulfate production over an average cloud lifetime.

It is shown that, prior to the introduction of evidence, the new  algorithm has a fixedpoint giving the correct marginal distributions even for loopy  networks, unlike its causal counterpart. A translation for causal networks is given  to allow for behavior of the two algorithms to be compared for the same networks,  and the comparison is discussed based on empirical results. The acausal algorithm is  seen to exhibit different, but not necessarily superior, convergence properties for  the networks tested. It may nonetheless be useful as an application of the principle  of Loopy Belief Propogation for systems which are given by acausal rather than  causal models, for which it provides a much faster computation than the  sampling-based techniques frequently applied in such cases.</description><creator>Renner, William</creator><contributor>Panangaden, Prakash (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Precup, Doina (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Acausal belief propogation for inference on belief networks</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gm80hv95v.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v118rf21c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8049g572m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Hierarchical habitat selection was studied in the North American  porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) in Parc National du Bic, Quebec, Canada.

Best results were obtained by injecting in the tail muscles, which allowed a 50%  reduction in dose relative to reported dosage. Hierarchical analysis of habitat  selection revealed that although porcupines are generalists at the landscape scale,  they display habitat selection at the home range and individual tree scales.  Human-used land and conifer forests were least preferred features of home ranges.

NF-E2 is a heterodimer comprised of a cap'n'collar factor (p45) and a small Maf  protein (MafF, G or K). It has been shown that NF-E2 promotes the opening of  chromatin throughout the beta-globin loci, promoting gene expression and erythroid  differentiation. Also, the p45 subunit is restricted to hematopoietic progenitor,  erythroid, megakaryocytic and mast cells while the small Mafs are ubiquitously  expressed. I have used the erythroleukemia cell lines, MEL and CB3, as  model systems to study the role of NF-E2.

The CAG  repeat (encoding glutamine) expansion is thought to confer a novel, toxic gain of  function to the protein that resulting in neuron-specific cell death. The mechanism  of cytotoxicity in these diseases is unknown, but often centers on the shared  pathological characteristic of protein aggregate formation. Recently, the  calcium-dependent enzyme transglutaminase has been implicated in aggregate formation  in several of these disorders. Cellular processes such as proteolysis, calcium  homeostasis, gene transcription, and mitochondrial function are likely affected by  polyglutamine-expanded proteins and contribute to pathogenesis. Expansion of the CAG repeat in the androgen receptor leads to  the X-linked disorder spinobulbar muscular atrophy. To examine underlying disease  mechanisms we investigated the link between polyglutamine-expanded androgen receptor  and transglutaminase. We found N-terminal androgen receptor fragments to be a  substrate for transglutaminase, and cells expressing polyglutamine-expanded androgen  receptor exhibited ligand-depended proteasome dysfunction. This effect was prevented  by the presence of cystamine, a transglutaminase inhibitor, suggesting involvement  of a transglutaminase-catalyzed reaction in disease pathogenesis and providing a  potential basis for the development of therapies for CAG-repeat expansion  disorders.</description><creator>Mandrusiak, Lisa</creator><contributor>Trifiro, Mark (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><subject>Biology, Genetics.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Transglutaminase potentiates proteasome dysfunction induced by polyglutamine-expanded androgen receptor : a potential pathogenic mechanism for spinobulbar muscular atrophy</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nz8060373.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/08612p22t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Human Genetics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):24950</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
