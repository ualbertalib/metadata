This study was one which had been suggested by Dr. John Campbell as being of potential importance in connection with the manufacture of chemical pulp. The work of Johnston and Maass was undertaken chiefly for the purpose of investigating the mechanics of forced penetration through wood. But these workers made some observations also upon the penetration of acid and alkaline cooking liquors. The results of their researches indicated that further work along this line might be of great interest. [...]</description><creator>Macklin, Lionel Stewart.</creator><contributor>Maass, O.

The latter is a misinterpretation of democratic and educational ideals. Variety in pupils' capacities and interests suggests the expediency of diversification of curricula in secondary education. Certain subjects must be included in every curriculum, but each pupil's timetable need not show the same relative quantity or time spent in every subject. The provision of a few typical alternative courses would enable pupils to make a selection suitable to their aptitudes and tastes. An initial examination would confirm objectively each pupil's fitness for the course preferred. [...]</description><creator>MacKinnon, Patrick Archibald.</creator><contributor>Clarke, F.

The existence of an "indifferent cell' from which either neurones or neuroglia may develop has been accepted in general by pathologists because of the usefulness of this conception in the classification of tumors of the glioma group.

Sympathetic and adrenalin stimulation caused discharge activity in demilune cells. Parasympathetic stimulation acted similarly on alveolar cells but not on demilunes. Both types of stimulation caused changes in striated ducts but the implicationa are not clear. A true augmented secretion was demonstrated. Histological results showed it to be mainly an increased sympathetic-demilune activity. Section of chorda tympani caused marked changes in striated ducts; alveolar cells were largely inactive; demilunes were in continued activity. Section of cervical sympathetic and extirpation of superior cervical ganglion gave no significant result. Sympathetic stimulation of chorda paralytic glands gave clear demonstrations of the sympathetic demilune mechanism.

Evidence of hyperfunction of the thyroid has been shown to occur in the rat and guinea pig following injection of the hormone. The toxins of staphylococcus aureus accentuate the effect of the thyreotropic hormone in the rat. Replacement therapy has been accomplished in the hypophysectomized rat with the thyreotropic hormone. A study has been made of the resistance to the hormone which develops in animals after prolonged injections. A substance which inhibits the action of thyreotropic hormone has been found in the serum of these animals. Animals of several different species have been used. Some of the physiological properties of the antithyreotropic substance have been investigated. [...]</description><creator>Anderson, Evelyn M.</creator><contributor>Collip, J.

It was first introduced to combat physical defects as a result of study. The Calendars of McGill (1907-8 etc) make frequent mention of exercises "to counteract bad and harmful positions assumed during study hours." The second stageconsiders this subject as a prevention for these defects, while the third stage though not discarding the first two ideals, recognizes social, mental and moral values also arising through Physical Education. Nary Lyon, the founder of Mount Holyoke College recognized these values as early as 1837 when she said that "daily exercise held in those days a place not unlike athletics ... as it developed team work and the gift of leadership."

It was not until 1928, however, that the effect was observed experimentally by Prof. Sir C.V.Raman(2) in Calcutta. Monochromatic light was allowed to fall on a liquid, the scattered light being analysed by means of a spectograph and lines being found on the photographic plate which were due to frequencies not present in the primary or incident light. These lines are now known as "Raman lines" and the phenomenon itself as the "Raman Effect." [...]</description><creator>Aikman, Edward Percy.</creator><contributor>Foster, J.

Particular attention has been paid to the use of hydroxylatedsolvents in the presence of catalysts. The pioneer work was carried out by H. J. Rowley (1), who introduced the use of glycol and was able to extract about one half of the ligninby this means, though the recovery was appreciably less. It was shown (4) that the presence of glycol gives rise to false methoxyl values, and this solvent was therefore replaced by methyl alcohol (2, 3, 4).
