Power-law scaling behaviour was demonstrated for the examined fields, from the smallest accessible measurement scales up to at least 250 km, right through the "mesoscale gap" postulated by the standard model of atmospheric dynamics. DTM results indicate remarkable stability in the estimates of the multifractality index, $ alpha$, and the codimension of mean singularity, $C sb1$, for wind velocity measured under different conditions of surface type, time of year, and measurement height within the surface boundary layer. Estimates for $ rm CO sb2, H sb2O, and O sb3$ were largely dominated by the wind velocity statistics as expected, but slightly sensitive to measurement height and moderately sensitive to significant changes in the underlying surface. Results showed that all of the fields examined may be classified as "unconditionally hard" multifractals, which is consistent with previously-published results for ground-based wind velocity measurements. It was demonstrated using probability distribution and multifractal analyses that ensemble statistical moments above approximately second-order can be expected to diverge for all examined fields due to the extremely singular nature of the fields at sub-resolution scales, and that the currently-employed quasi-local aircraft based sampling strategy is capable of reliably characterizing the statistical behaviour of the examined fields up to this physically-imposed limit.

In this domain, we examine some of the main issues related to automatic object identification based on a natural language description. In particular, the descriptions are referring expressions, and the goal is to identify the referent through a combination of dialogue and autonomous sensing. The first step in this process involves bridging the gap between the user and system representations of the world. A number of concepts are expressed in natural language by vague terms like "the big box" and "very close to the door". We use fuzzy logic to map these vague terms onto the quantitative sensory data used in the computer representation of the environment. The uncertainty resulting from this mapping is abated by allowing the robotic agent to query the user for more information or to use sensors to collect missing data. We examine the trade-off between querying the user, sensing, and uncertainty in the situations where identification is not immediately realizable. Furthermore, we have devised an efficient questioning strategy based on the use of entropy to select the questions having the greatest discriminatory power over referent candidates. We have developed a framework to deal with each of these issues and have implemented a working system to demonstrate our strategies.</description><creator>Pateras, Claudia</creator><contributor>DeMori, R.

The high activity of the HDR brachytherapy source is suitable for the prompt delivery of the high doses required to give changes in the Fricke-gelatin Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) characteristics which are readily detected by MRI. The MR images can map 3D dose distributions deposited in the Fricke-gelatin matrix. Spin-lattice relaxation times (T1) and rates (R1) are computed from MR images of irradiated Fricke gelatin phantoms in order to study the dose response relationship for the Fricke gelatin system. It was confirmed that the Fricke gelatin system's R1 varies linearly with absorbed dose to a saturation limit. A fast approach for determining radiation dose from MR image intensity using a calibration curve is described. Dose distributions generated from MR images via the calibration curve show good agreement with expected distributions generated from a computerized treatment plan. As well, dose data generated using R1 maps agreed well with those generated by calibration curve. The use of MRI with Fricke-gel dosimetry is shown to be a viable means of verifying the dose distributions from high activity brachytherapy sources.</description><creator>Parker, William, 1969-</creator><contributor>Schreiner, L.

The aperture angle $ theta(x)$ with respect to Q is defined as the angle subtended by the cone that: (1) contains Q, (2) has apex at x, and (3) has its two rays emanating from x tangent to Q. The Aperture-Angle Problem in the Euclidean Plane $E sp2$ is defined as follows: Given two disjoint convex sets P and Q in $E sp2$, find a point $X in P$ such that $ theta(X)$ is the maximum value of the aperture angle function, and a point Z in P such that $ theta(Z)$ is the minimum value. We present an $O(n+m)$ time algorithm for computing the minimum aperture angle with respect to a convex polygon Q when x is allowed to vary in a convex polygon P(n and m are the number of vertices, respectively). We also present algorithms with complexities $O(n log m)$ and $O(n+m)$ for computing the maximum aperture angle with respect to Q. To compute the minimum aperture angle we modify the latter algorithm obtaining an $O(n+m)$ algorithm. Finally, we prove an $ Omega(n)$ time lower bound for the maximization and minimization problems, and an $ Omega(m)$ time lower bound for the minimization problem. In three dimensions we find the solution to the following problem: Given a convex polyhedron K and given a segment ab that does not intersect K, find a point X $ in$ K such that the aperture angle defined as ang(aXb) is the maximum of the aperture angle function. We present a solution whose time complexity is linear with respect to the number of edges of K, i.e., it is O(n) if the corresponding convex polyhedron K has n vertices. We prove an $ Omega(n)$ time lower bound for this problem.</description><creator>Omaña-Pulido, Elsa Patricia</creator><date>1994</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Aperture angle optimization problems</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ww72bd767.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rf55z984k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:d217qr64b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:07:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>There are some examples where conformational restriction has been introduced into nucleotides with the sole purpose of increasing the thermodynamic stability of the duplex or triplex between the modified oligonucleotide and its complement.

It should not exclusively capture the basic information of the processes, but also address the various kinds of documentation related to the processes under consideration. In this combination, organizational models will be more expressive and useful. The research reported here describes and demonstrates a new approach for reconciling formal and informal documentation in business modelling. It is based on the integration of an underlying formal modelling approach with hypertext concepts that provide mechanisms for capturing, manipulating and viewing informal model documentation. We have developed the Hypertec tool which complements the Macrotec environment. Macrotec is a business modelling environment that is based on the formalism of extended colored Petri nets. Hypertec is a hypertext-based component supporting authoring, display and navigation of all the process documentation that cannot be captured by Macrotec. Our experience with Macrotec/Hypertec shows that their combined functionality substantially facilitates the understanding of business processes and clearly reduces problems such as miscommunication, misinterpretation, and misunderstandings about entire processes or some of their components.</description><creator>Noaman, Amin Yousef</creator><date>1995</date><subject>Information Science.</subject><subject>Business Administration, Management.</subject><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Reconciling formal and informal documentation in business modelling</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5h73pz08s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7p88cj70f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hm50tt75f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:07:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a high intensity strengthening program on both muscle function and mobility in an elderly, institutionalized population. Thirty male subjects were randomly assigned to a training group three times per week or to a control "attention" group. Dynamic and isometric strength of the quadriceps, shoulder extensors and elbow flexors were measured by the one repetition maximum (1RM) and a hand-held dynamometer (Nicholas Manual Muscle Tester), respectively. Mobility skills were evaluated with the timed "Up &amp; Go" (TUG) test and by an average walking speed over 30 m. Following the 12 week intervention, post-training evaluations demonstrated significant differences between groups with improved 1RM of both quadriceps (47%), isometric strength of the right shoulder extensors (15%), TUG scores (39%) and average walking speeds (17%). In conclusion, high intensity strength training was found to be not only feasible in the reversal of muscle weakness but also as an effective strategy in attenuating the potential loss of mobility often observed in an elderly, institutionalized population.</description><creator>Newnham, Judi</creator><contributor>St.Pierre, D.

In the present study we used different exogenous NO congeners to investigate the effects of different redox forms of NO on iron metabolism and cellular proliferation of human K562 erythroleukemia cells. Treatment of K562 cells for 18 h with the nitrosonium ion (NO$ sp+$) donor, sodium nitroprusside (1 mM), decreased mRNA binding activity of iron regulatory factor (IRF), transferrin receptor (TfR) mRNA, TfR number and also iron uptake. However, cellular proliferation was not decreased. On the contrary, treatment of K562 cells with the nitric oxide (NO$ cdot$) donor, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (1 mM), slightly increased IRF activity, TfR mRNA level, TfR number and iron uptake. Furthermore, cellular proliferation was decreased. We speculate that NO$ sp+$ may regulate IRF, the key regulatory molecule in iron metabolism, via S-nitrosylation of critical free sulphydryl group(s), while NO$ cdot$ may ligate to FeS cluster in IRF. The new concept of different redox forms of NO opens an interesting possibility of IRF inactivation by NO$ sp+$, which may be a very important step in the inhibition of growth of target tumor cells by activated cytotoxic macrophages.</description><creator>Neumannova, Vera</creator><contributor>Ponka, Prem (advisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>The effects of redox species of nitrogen monoxide on transferrin and iron uptake and cellular proliferation of erythroleukemia (K562) cells</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6m311r467.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ms35tb54q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:f1881p100</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:07:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis studies various aspects of the accuracy issue in image-guided neurosurgery (IGNS). Factors such as registration, MR geometrical distortions and accuracy of digitizing device, are theoretically described in a general model of IGNS. The means of registering the patient to its image data is then studied, starting with the definition of registration error. Computer simulations of registration by homologous point matching are described along with a clinical study comparing homologous point matching and surface matching registration methods. A 3-D MR geometrical distortion experiment performed on a stereotactic frame is presented. These measurements demonstrate the discrepancy that can be observed in the geometry of the frame when imaged with differing read-out gradient directions, and quantitatively evaluate the geometrical distortion associated with the image of the frame of known geometry. Since geometrical distortion of MR images can adversely affect the accuracy of IGNS, the three-point-Dixon MR pulse sequence is evaluated as a means of estimating the magnetic field inhomogeneity, and hence potential geometrical errors in images. Finally, an experimental comparison of mechanical and optical localizing devices is described, resulting in a quantitative estimate of the precision and accuracy of both systems.</description><creator>Munger, Patrice</creator><contributor>Peters, Terry M.

In support of this, ovulation is preceded by an increase in follicular fluid (FF) PG concentration, indomethacin (INDO) suppresses both the PG increase and ovulation, and ovulation can be restored by administration of exogenous PGs (Downey and Ainsworth, 1980; Prostaglandins 19: 17-22). Recent studies in the rat have shown that ovulation is also preceded by a rise in ovarian concentrations of 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), a product of the lipoxygenase pathway (Tanaka et al., 1989; Endocrinology 15: 1373-1377) and inhibition of this pathway suppresses ovulation (Reich et al., 1983; Prostaglandins 26: 1011-1020). Furthermore, INDO, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, inhibits 15-lipoxygenase as well as PG synthesis (Tanaka et al., 1989 Endocrinology 15: 1373-1377). The PMSG/hCG prepuberal gilt model was used to investigate the involvement of 15-HETE in the procine ovulatory process, and the effect of INDO on the 15-lipoxygenase pathway. Follicular fluid concentrations of 15-HETE were elevated 40 h post hCG (p $&lt;$ 0.01). The effects of INDO and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), an inhibitor of lipoxygenase activity, on ovulation rate, FF 15-HETE and FF PGF$ rm sb{2a}$ were investigated by intraovarian administration of INDO or NDGA. INDO inhibited ovulation rate (p $&lt;$ 0.01) and PGF$ rm sb{2a}$ (p $&lt;$ 0.01) as well as 15-HETE (p $&lt;$ 0.01). NDGA also suppressed ovulation rate (p $&lt;$ 0.01) but did not inhibit 15-HETE or PGF$ rm sb{2a}$ production. In in vitro experiments, 15-HETE production by both granulosa cell (GC) and theca interna cell (TIC) cultures 40 h post hCG was greater (p $&lt;$ 0.01) than at 0 h post hCG. INDO inhibited 15-HETE production in 40 h post hCG TIC cultures (p $&lt;$ 0.01) but not GC cultures, while NDGA inhibited 15-HETE production by both cell types (p $&lt;$ 0.01).

Water column samples were collected during the ice-free season (June to October), at various locations and depths within the La Grande-2 and Laforge-1 hydroelectric reservoirs, as well as in several neighbouring lakes. Close-interval sampling of porewaters in lake sediments, peat bogs, and flooded soils was accomplished via in situ dialysis. All Hg analyses were conducted in the field laboratory within 12 hours of sample collection, using cold vapour atomic fluorescence spectrometry. Water column (Hg$ sb{ tau} rbrack rm sb{D}$ are nearly constant, with an average value of 2.3 ng L$ sp{-1}.$ No significant concentration difference was noted regardless of: (1) the type of aquatic system, (2) the composition of the underlying soil, (3) the impoundment history, (4) the depth of the water column, or (5) seasonal changes. Preliminary results for porewater (Hg$ sb{ tau} rbrack rm sb{D}$ show them to be 2 to 3 times greater than those of the overlying water. In most profiles (Hg$ sb{ tau} rbrack rm sb{D}$ values do not show much variation with depth, away from the sediment-water interface. Despite the concentration differences near the interface, diffusion of Hg from the sediments to the water column is not apparent from this study, as satisfactory determinations of (Hg$ sb{ tau} rbrack rm sb{D}$ right at the interface were not possible. Biogeochemical processes acting near the interface (e.g. assimilation by periphyton, chelation by organic matter, methylation-demethylation, absorption on metal oxides) may be responsible for attenuating the release of dissolved Hg to the water column.</description><creator>Montgomery, Shelagh</creator><contributor>Mucci, Alfonso (advisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Biology, Limnology.</subject><subject>Biogeochemistry.</subject><subject>Environmental Sciences.</subject><subject>Energy.</subject><title>Total dissolved mercury in the water column and interstitial waters of natural aquatic systems and hydroelectric reservoirs of Northern Québec (Canada)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j3860899q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94hr731</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:f1881p118</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:07:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Studies of long-acting benzodiazepines (LABZ) use in elderly patients found an increased risk of deterioration in cognitive function, falls, hip fractures and car accidents. The purpose of this study was to identify the characteristics of physicians who prescribe LABZ to elderly patients. French language, increased number of years since medical school graduation, training as a general practitioner, physician gender and practice in a long-term care setting were risk factors for excessive prescribing of LABZ. Differences were also noted between the various provincial medical schools. University affiliation was associated with a decreased risk of being an excessive prescriber of LABZ. Reduction of the amount of LABZ prescribed and drug-related illnesses will depend on the identification of potentially modifiable physician risk factors.</description><creator>Monette, Johanne</creator><contributor>Tamblyn, Robyn (advisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</subject><subject>Gerontology.</subject><title>Association entre les caractéristiques des medécins et la prescription de benzodiazépines à longue-action aux personnes agées</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gb19f8062.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f1881p118</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jw827d73n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:07:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis, we study toy models of two-dimensional gravity. We first review two known models: the classical and quantum corrected CGHS models and the quantum corrected model of RST. These two models have black holes solutions with curvature singularities, similar to the Schwartzschild black hole. This singularity becomes naked in the RST model at a certain event during the evaporation. In the third chapter, we build a more general version with new quantum corrections beyond those presented in the RST model, which enable us to find a model without curvature singularities. We will also see that these new quantum corrections can affect the rate of Hawking radiation flowing from the black hole.</description><creator>Michaud, Guy, 1971-</creator><contributor>Myers, Robert C.

An apparatus measuring the MOKE of magnetic medium was designed and constructed. The surface magneto-optic Kerr effect (SMOKE) of a magnetic multilayer is a measurement of the average magnetization of several layers within the penetration depth of the light. SMOKE measurements on a series of sputtered $ rm Ni sb{80}Co sb{20}15 A$/CU$(t sb{Cu}),$ where $t sb{Cu}$ is the thickness of Cu spacer layer, multilayers confirms that the coupling strength in these multilayers oscillates from antiferromagnetic (AF) coupling to ferromagnetic coupling as a function of Cu spacer layer thickness. Low-angle x-ray diffraction and SMOKE measurements on a series of AF-coupled $ rm (Ni sb{80}Co sb{20}15 A$/Cu20A) $ times$ N multilayers with bilayer numbers N ranging from 8 to 100 shows that cumulative interface roughness increases with increasing N, as do the saturation field and coercivity. This is possibly due to the out-of-plane anisotropy associated with cumulative interface roughness in multilayers. An AF-coupled $ rm (Ni sb{70}Co sb{30}15 A$/Cu20A) $ times$ 10 was continually annealed up to 400$ sp circ$C in several steps, and the magnetic behaviour of the sample was evaluated as a function of annealing temperatures. $ rm (Ni sb{70}Co sb{30}15 A$/CU20A/Ni$ rm sb{70}Co sb{30} A$/CU20A) $ times$ 5 multilayer was used for investigating the AF coupling between magnetic layers of unequal thicknesses. Finally, an AF-coupled $ rm (Ni sb{70}Co sb{30}15 A$/Cu20A/Ni$ rm sb{70}Co sb{30}15 A$/Cu35A) $ times$ 5 multilayer was sputtered and used to study the magnetization of an AF-coupled multilayer with two different coupling strengthes.</description><creator>Meng, Xiadong</creator><contributor>Muir, W.

Few measurement tools assessing these problems in the community-dwelling elderly with Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type (DAT) currently exist. Recently, the Disability Assessment for Dementia Scale (DAD) was developed to assess disabilities in activities of daily living experienced by this population. The Disability Assessment for Dementia Scale (DAD) is a proxy-respondent scale measuring disability in daily living tasks in terms of executive functions. The objectives of this study were to measure the criterion-related (concurrent) validity and the construct validity of this scale. Total score correlational analyses between the Rapid Disability Rating Scale-2 and the Disability Assessment for Dementia Scale were used to estimate criterion-related (concurrent) validity. In addition, the known-groups procedure was used to estimate criterion-related (concurrent) validity. Stage of dementia served as the known-group variable against which total DAD Scale scores were compared. Construct validity was estimated using total score correlational analyses between the Burden of Care Scale and the Disability Assessment for Dementia Scale (DAD). Likewise, construct validity was estimated using total score correlational analyses between the standardized Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and the DAD Scale. Correlations proved highly significant for criterion-related (concurrent) validity measures r = $-$0.84, and for known-groups procedure estimates r = $-$0.73. Results for construct validity measures were r = $-$0.29 for Burden of Care scores and r = 0.55 for MMSE scores. Interpretations for these findings were offered in the discussion of this project. Findings indicated that the Disability Assessment for Dementia Scale is a valid disability measurement for community-dwelling Alzheimer's subjects, and support its use in this type of DAT population.</description><creator>McIntyre, Maria C.

This probabilistic approach accurately describes the contours with a small number of $C sp2$ continuous splines. The approximation is refined iteratively using a quality function. The evaluation method is based upon the smoothness of the generated outline and the precision at which it interpolates the original contour. Merge operations of adjacent Bezier splines and spline alterations using an adaptive random search technique are employed for finding an optimal solution. A program implementing the proposed algorithm was created and may be used to automatically generate PostScript type 1 fonts. The algorithm has shown to be very stable and to converge rapidly.

Three groups of subjects performed two experiments, (1) a lexical decision task (on-line) and, (2) a grammaticality judgement task (off-line). Grammaticality was controlled by the manipulation of tense for regular and irregular verbs. Participants were six members of a large British familial aggregation diagnosed with developmental language impairment, six of their unaffected relatives, and seven unaffected Canadian individuals. The results of the lexical decision task indicate that the reaction times of the affected group were slower than the Canadian control group. Unlike the control groups, the affected group was influenced by regular and irregular verb type distinctions. Reaction times across grammatical and ungrammatical conditions did not differ among the three groups. The groups differed significantly in the off-line task; accuracy of the affected subjects was poor, while the control subjects were highly accurate. The implications of these findings for linguistic theories of SLI such as the missing rules hypothesis (Gopnik, in press) are discussed.</description><creator>Mayo, Lori</creator><contributor>Crago, Martha B.

SGP-1 is a 70 KDa protein secreted by the Sertoli cells. Once secreted in the seminiferous lumen, the protein binds to the tail of spermatozoa. In the efferent ducts, it is endocytosed by the nonciliated cells, presumably via a receptor-mediated process. Because the initial steps of receptor-mediated endocytosis result from the binding of a ligand's terminal oligosaccharide to a receptor on the ceil surface, several monosaccharides were injected into the lumen of the rete testis to study their effect on the endocytosis of SGP-1 in the efferent duct. The labeling density of various endocytic compartments was estimated and compared in untreated and treated animals with various sugars. The following sugars were tested: glucose, galactose, mannose, mannose 6-phosphate, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, and sialic acid. The findings suggest that, via its sialic acid binding domain, SGP-1 may bind to glycolipids on the tail of spermatozoa, remove them from the membrane forming a lipo-protein complex. The complex may then be endocytosed by the nonciliated cells, via a receptor that would recognize SGP-1's terminal sialic acid residues, and be delivered to the lysosomes to be degraded.

A single-strength, a double strength and a triple-strength lemon juice were subjected to four different current densities (0.116, 0.231, 0.463 and 0.926 A/m$ sp2)$ for 30 minutes using an electrolytic cell. Dissolved oxygen level, conductivity, redox potential, pH in juices and the voltage applied to the electrodes required to maintain constant current density through the cell were monitored. Juice samples were taken at 0, 5, 15 and 30 minutes and then stored for one month at 30$ sp circ$C. After one month of storage, juice samples were assessed for browning and quality alteration. The chemical indices used were the browning index and concentrations in furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). Although redox potentials and concentrations in dissolved oxygen were significantly reduced by the electrolytic cell treatment, none of the electrochemical treatments significantly retarded detrimental reactions in juices over the storage period. Initial levels in dissolved oxygen and redox potential do not seem to have any significant effect on browning or chemical quality deterioration in lemon juices. Thus, the present study suggests that nonenzymatic browning in lemon juice products may be due to factors other than oxidative reactions.</description><creator>Marquis, Bruno</creator><contributor>Raghavan, G.

The first demonstration of modularity was provided in 1957 by Mountcastle in the somatosensory cortex, and has since been demonstrated in the visual cortex, where neurons within a vertical unit of the visual cortex process information about the same portion of the visual field. A new approach has been proposed for identifying functionally similar neurons by examining their molecular characteristics. Indeed, the arrangement of neurons into functional arrays might be reflected by the presence of specific molecules (e.g Cat-301 patches, cytochrome oxidase blobs). In this experiment, immunohistochemistry was used to examine the tangential and radial distribution and development of a subset of pyramidal neurons in the kitten and adult cat visual cortex using the monoclonal antibody SMI-32, that recognizes the non-phosphorylated form of neurofilament H. It was found that the neurons recognized by this antibody were grouped into clusters, forming regularly spaced patches in the infragranular and supragranular layers. These anatomical findings support the notion of an intrinsic columnar organization.</description><creator>Mareschal, Isabelle</creator><contributor>Baker, Curtis (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Visual cortex.</subject><subject>Cats -- Physiology.</subject><subject>Immunohistochemistry.</subject><title>Tangential distribution of SMI-32 immunoreactive neurons in cat visual cortex</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2227mr98d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/73666670v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8p58pg07j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:08:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The perinuclear theca is a unique cytoskeletal element that encapsulates the nucleus of mammalian spermatozoa except for a narrow zone around the insertion of the sperm tail. It is composed of two distinct regions, a subacrosomal layer or perforatorium and, continuing caudally beyond the acrosomic system, the postacrosomal sheath. Gel electrophoresis revealed that the extracts were composed of several polypeptide bands, of which the 15.5, 25, 28, 32, 36, and 60 kDa bands were most prominent in the bull. Antibodies against the 15.5 and 60 polypeptides of the bull reacted monospecifically with their respective bands on immunoblots and immunogold labeled the perforatorium and the entire perinuclear theca, respectively. Antibodies against the 25, 28, 32, and 36 kDa polypeptides of the bull showed distinctive patterns of cross reactivity with other polypeptides on Western blots, but immunogold labeled exclusively the entire perinuclear theca. Similar manipulation of human spermatozoa revealed that this element was composed of three major polypeptides, including the 14, 15, and 67 kDa bands. The anti-15.5 (bull) antibody, in addition to an antibody against the 15 kDa protein of rat spermatozoa (raised in a previous study) each cross-reacted with the 15 and 67 kDa polypeptides on Western blots of the human perinuclear theca. Conversely, the anti-60 (bull) antibody and an anti-60 (rat) antibody each reacted monospecifically with the 67 kDa polypeptide of the human perinuclear theca. As well, the anti-60 (bull) antibody immunogold labeled the entire perinuclear theca of human spermatozoa.

Females are fertile and not all their progeny are affected. Those embryos which do not hatch show defects in their antero-posterior polarity, and give rise to bicaudal embryos which are duplicated for posterior structures. Twelve alleles of the genes have been phenotypically analysed. The penetrance of each allele has been determined and the phenotypes of embryonic defects such as mouth/head defect, bicaudal and uncellularized embryos classified and scored, in order to use this information to analyse these alleles at the cellular and molecular level. The bicaudal phenotype results from the mislocalization of the oskar and nanos RNA at the anterior end of the embryos. The gene also has a recessive phenotype which makes the females sterile. The phenotype is the result of specific defects in follicle cell migration. The alleles have been subdivided into two classes according to their phenotype: weak and strong. The gene encoding Bicaudal-C has been cloned and sequenced.

The theorems obtained completely describe the structure of centroids for the important class of CSA-groups, which allows us to obtain as a corollary the corresponding results for torsion-free hyperbolic groups, groups acting freely on $ Lambda$-trees, and universally free groups. We also consider this problem for other classes of groups, such as nilpotent groups, and for free group constructions. General aspects of the theory of exponential groups are discussed in sufficient detail.</description><creator>Lyutikov, Sergey</creator><contributor>Kharlampovich, Olga (advisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Mathematics.</subject><title>Centroids of some classes of exponential groups</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/db78tf12j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/02870x995</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kw52jb02j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:08:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis we construct the tensor A-completion over an arbitrary torsion-free ring A for groups whose maximal abelian subgroups are either conjugate separated or A-modules. As a corollary, this result gives us an explicit description of the structure of tensor completion for groups of the form $F/N sp prime,$ in particular, for free solvable groups. Moreover, it is proved that the class of A-faithful groups is closed under free products. We also discuss some general aspects of the theory of exponential groups and tensor completions.</description><creator>Lyutikova, Ekaterina</creator><contributor>Kharlampovich, O.
