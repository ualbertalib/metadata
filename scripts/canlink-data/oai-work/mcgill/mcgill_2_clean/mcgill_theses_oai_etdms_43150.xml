The  glycophosphatidyl inositol-anchored family members, CEA and CEACAM6, are  over-expressed in as many as 70% of all human cancers. This correlation suggested  their role in tumor progression, which was supported by extensive results obtained  with several systems in vitro and ex vivo. But their contribution and relevance in  vivo remains uncertain without further validation. Since mice do not possess  homologs of the CEA and CEACAM6 genes, transgenic mice harboring a 187 kb portion of  the human CEACAM family gene locus contained in a bacterial artificial chromosome  (CEABAC) that includes CEA, CEACAM3, CEACAM6, and CEACAM7 genes were constructed in  this study. The spatiotemporal expression pattern of these genes is very similar to  that in humans. The expression levels of these genes are gene dosage dependent.  Moreover, these CEABAC mice are more susceptible to develop carcinogen-induced colon  tumors and spontaneous lung tumors. At low to moderate expression levels of  CEA/CEACAM6, a partial block in cell differentiation and a mild to moderate  hyperproliferation were evident in the transgenic colon; however, these mice develop  normally. At higher or tumor-like expression levels, a complete block in cell  differentiation, an extreme hyperproliferation and an inhibition of apoptosis were  observed. These mice showed reduced survival, growth retardation and chronic  diarrhea, and showed massively enlarged colons comprising continuous non-focal  cytological and architectural abnormalities, including a dysplastic and serrated  adenomatous morphology, by only 3 months of age. These results suggested that, while  moderate expression levels of CEA/CEACAM6 cause an imbalance of tissue homeostasis  leading to increased tumor susceptibility, tumor-like exp</description><creator>Chan, Carlos H.

The major objective of the present thesis was to isolate and identify  antitumor compounds in cow's milk kefir and investigate the possible mechanisms  involved. High speed centrifugation (HSC), molecular weight cut-off filtration  (MWCO), size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography (SEC-HPLC) and reverse  phase-HPLC (RP-HPLC) were utilized for fractionation of kefir and a cell culture  model was developed to screen for the antiproliferative effects of the kefir  fractions. The antiproliferative effects of bacteria-free extracts from different  fermentation stages of kefir production, as well as bacteria-free extracts from milk  and yogurt were compared. The results showed that extracts from an early stage of  fermentation (i.e., kefir mother culture) and the final commercial kefir product  both exerted dose-dependent inhibition effects on human mammary tumor MCF-7 cells,  yogurt extracts showed less potent antiproliferative effects, while pasteurized milk  extracts showed no antiproliferative effects. No antiproliferative effects of the  kefir extracts were observed on human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) whereas the  yogurt extracts showed antiproliferative action in HMEC cells at a high dose. A  fraction of the kefir mother culture isolated by HSC, MWCO and RP-HPLC contained  components that inhibited MCF-7 cell growth and had no effect on HMEC cells.  Characterization of the bioactive fraction using mass spectrometry (MS) indicated  that the main components in the fraction are likely fragments of kefiran and/or  ceramide containing compounds such as gangliosides. The growth inhibitory effect may  be mainly caused by the induction of TNF-alpha in MCF-7 cells. Whole extracts of  kefir depleted glutathione (GSH) in MCF-7 cells, while the SEC-HPLC Fraction 7 and  the RP-HPLC Fraction 30 induced GSH produc</description><creator>Chen, Chujian, 1966-</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Antineoplastic agents.</subject><subject>Breast -- Cancer -- Nutritional aspects.</subject><subject>Functional foods -- Analysis.</subject><subject>Kefir -- Health aspects.</subject><title>Antitumor properties of kefir : possible bioactive component(s) and mechanism(s)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/th83kz80r.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nc580n07w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k643b175t</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:21:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation proposes an interdisciplinary approach for the  study of the timbre of the classical guitar. We start by identifying the static;  control parameters of timbre, relating to the structural components of the guitar  and the dynamic control parameters of timbre, relating to the gestures applied by  the performer on the instrument. From the plucked string physical model (obtained  from the transverse wave equation), we derive a digital signal interpretation of the  plucking effect which is a comb filtering. Then we investigate how subjective  characteristics of sound, like timbre, are related to gesture parameters. The  starting point for exploration is an inventory of verbal descriptors commonly used  by professional musicians to describe the brightness, the colour, the shape and the  texture of the sounds they produce on their instruments. An explanation for the  voice-like nature of guitar tones is proposed based on the observation that the  maxima of the comb-filter-shaped magnitude spectrum of guitar tones are located at  frequencies similar to the formant frequencies of a subset of identifiable vowels.  These analogies at the spectral level might account for the origin of some timbre  descriptors such as open, oval, round, thin, closed, nasal and hollow, that seem to  refer to phonetic gestures. In a experiment conducted to confirm these analogies,  participants were asked to associate a consonant to the attack and a vowel to the  decay of guitar tones. The results of this study support the idea that some  perceptual dimensions of the guitar timbre space can be borrowed from phonetics.  Finally, we address the problem of the indirect acquisition of instrumental gesture  parameters. Pursuing previous research on the estimation of the plucking position  from a recording, we propose a new estimation method based on an iterative weighted  least-square algorithm, starting from a first approximation derived from a variant  of the autocorrelation func</description><creator>Traube, Caroline</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Guitar -- Instruction and study.</subject><title>An interdisciplinary study of the timbre of the classical guitar /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xw42n845p.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k643b175t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ww72bc00p</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:21:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This is a study of a problem in the logic of belief revision. On  the assumption of a number of fairly traditional views concerning the relationship  between mind and world, the mechanics of perception, and the nature of belief, an  argument is made to the effect that revision of extant beliefs is impossible even in  the light of new perceptual experience. The argument turns on the ability of a  cognitive system to recognize conflict among its thoughts and perceptions. A number  of models of the mechanics of perceptual interpretation are explored, all of which  are revealed to share a susceptibility to the problem as posed. Certain objections  are taken up, the responses to which modify the scope of the original argument;  although the problem may yet be said to arise in a number of crucial contexts where  its presence is undesirable, some situations are found in which the problem can be  dissolved. The problem is then reexamined in light of the epistemological position  called fallibilism, with an eye to demonstrating that it arises notwithstanding the  highly cautious perspective embodied in that position. A solution to the problem is  then offered in the form of a family of model cognitive systems with certain  properties. Because the problem is a feature of belief-based cognitive systems, the  family of systems offered in arguing for a resolution of the problem is constructed  on the notion that cognition, construed as information processing, normally proceeds  without any epistemic evaluations being attached either to perceptions in particular  or thoughts in general. The non-evaluative propositional attitude employed in normal  cognition should, I argue, be what I call acceptance. The propositional attitude of  belief, traditionally conceived of as occupying the role now given to acceptance, is  accorded an extremely limited scope of application.

Four  studies sought to clarify the debate between behaviorist (Eisenberger and Cameron,  1996; Eisenberger, Pierce, and Cameron, 1999; Eisenberger, Rhoades, and Cameron,  1999) and the social cognitive researchers (Deci &amp; Ryan, 1980, 1985; Deci,  Koestner, &amp; Ryan, 1999) regarding the impact of such incentives on perceived  autonomy. Two experimental studies (Studies 1 and 2) examined this relationship  among college students and elementary school children. Results revealed an  undermining effect of performance-contingent rewards on participants' affective  experience of autonomy (enhanced feelings of pressure and tension). No significant  results were found on intrinsic motivation for college students, whereas for  elementary school children, rewards increased enjoyment for the target  activity. Two field-based quasi-experimental studies (Studies 3 and 4)  were designed to explore the impact of performance-contingent rewards in an  organizational setting. Both studies differentiated between private sector workers,  who received a merit-based salary (performance-reward expectancy) and workers from  the public sector who received a salary based on seniority (no performance-reward  expectancy). Study 3 replicated the previous findings by demonstrating that that  performance-reward expectancy undermined workers perceived autonomy. Study 4  extended these results by revealing that the presence of performance contingent  reward programs in organizations undermined employees' work satisfaction and  relatedness. Such incentives also had a tendency to reduce workers' adjustment to  retirement.</description><creator>Houlfort, Nathalie</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Motivation (Psychology)</subject><subject>Performance -- Psychological aspects.</subject><subject>Reward (Psychology)</subject><title>The impact of performance-contingent rewards on perceived autonomy and intrinsic motivation /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xs55mc49j.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rt847</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cv43nx454</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:21:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A continuing challenge in occupational hygiene is that of  estimating exposure to the multitude of airborne chemicals found in the workplace  and surrounding community. Occupational exposure limits (OELs) have been established  to prescribe the acceptable time weighted average for many different chemicals.  Comparing the OELs to the measured workplace concentration allows occupational  hygienists to assess the health risks and the need for control measures. Hence,  methods to more effectively sample contaminants in the workplace are necessary to  ensure that accurate exposure characterizations are completed. Evacuated canisters  have been used for many years to collect ambient air samples for gases and vapors.  Recently, increased interest has arisen in using evacuated canisters for personal  breathing zone sampling as an alternative to sorbent samplers. A capillary flow  control device was designed at McGill University mid 1990s. The flow control device  was designed to provide a very low flow rate to allow a passive sample to be  collected over an extended period of time. This research focused on the development  and evaluation of a methodology to use a small canister coupled with the capillary  flow controllers to collect long term time weighted air samples for gases and  vapors. A series of flow rate experiments were done to test the  capillary flow capabilities with a 300 mL canister for sampling times ranging from a  few minutes to over 40 hours. Flow rates ranging from 0.05 to 1.0 mL/min were  experimentally tested and empirical formulae were developed to predict flow rates  for given capillary geometries. The low flow rates allow for the collection of a  long term air sample in a small personal canister. Studies to examine the collection of air contaminants were  conducted in laboratory and in field tests. Air samples for six volatile organic  compounds were collected from a small exposure chamber using the  capillary-canisters, charcoal tubes and diffusive badges at varied concentrations.  The results from the three sampling devices were compared to each other and to  concentration values obtained by an on-line gas chromatography. The results indicate  that the capillary-canister compares quite favorably to the sorbent methods and to  the on line GC values for the six compounds evaluated. Personal air monitoring was conducted in a large exposure  chamber to assess the effectiveness of the capillary-canister method to evaluate  breathing zone samples. In addition, field testing was performed at a manufacturing  facility to assess the long term monitoring capabilities of the capillary-canister.  Precision and accuracy were found to parallel that of sorbent sampling  methods. The capillary-canister device displayed many positive attributes  for occupational and community air sampling. Extended sampling times, greater  capabilities to sample a broad range of chemicals simultaneously, ease of use, ease  of analysis and the low relative cost of the flow controller should allow for  improvements in exposure assessment.</description><creator>Rossner, Alan</creator><contributor>Farant, Jean-Pierre (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Environmental Sciences.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Occupational Health and Safety.</subject><title>The development and evaluation of a novel personal air sampling canister for the collection of gases and vapors /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k643b177c.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cv43nx454</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g445cd64s</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:21:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis presents new approach to the supervisory control of  complex systems modelled as Multi-Agent (MA) products of finite deterministic  automata. First, the centralized supervisory control problem for the MA  product is considered. This differs from the standard approach to supervisory  control since (i) vector languages are under consideration and (ii) each supervisor  can disable only one particular component of a vector event. The notion of MA  controllability is introduced and is shown to essentially constitute a necessary and  sufficient condition for the synthesis of an MA supervisor. In the case when a given  vector language K fails to be MA controllable, an algorithm for finding the infimal  MA controllable superlanguage of K is presented. It is also shown that there exists,  with respect to the inclusion partial order, a maximal MA controllable sublanguage  of K. The results constitute a natural extension of the central classical  supervisory control results for scalar systems to the more general MA product system  case. Second, the controllability properties of component structures  are investigated. It is proved that the property of MA controllability is preserved  under iterative MA product construction. Moreover, it is proved that in this case  the MA product of supervisors of subsystems ensures the desired behaviour of the MA  product of specifications for the iterative MA product. Several examples illustrate  that neither standard controllability nor the second property of MA controllability,  so-called MAC2, are preserved under projection operation. However, a sufficient  condition for the standard controllability of a component in terms of the original  vector specification and the MA product is given. The equality of the vector  specification projected on the set of some components of an original MA product and  an MA product of the projections on the corresponding components is shown to be a  necessary and sufficient condition for the projected specification having MAC2  property. Furthermore, a special class of specifications, namely, state trajectory  specifications, for both scalar and vector automata is considered and conditions for  the embedding of two specifications are presented. Third, the notion of the Graph-Relation MA product is  introduced. Through this construction, we modify the connection of supervisors and  vector system under consideration, and prove that the property of MA controllably  remains the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a solution to  the supervisory control problem. Next, an initial investigation on the MA product  under partial observation is presented. The notions of MA observability and MA  co-observability are formulated and it is shown that they play a key role in the  solution of decentralized supervisory control problems for the MA product.  Furthermore, applications to hybrid systems are explored. Finally, a line of further research on centralized and  decentralized MA product is mapped out, as well as complexity studies and the  generation of MA software.</description><creator>Romanovski, Iakov</creator><contributor>Caines, Peter E.

The ability to bind to RNA  renders them suitable as probes for many biological applications, such as 'antisense  technology'. Little is known about the effect of sugar structure (and conformation)  on the binding properties of 2',5'-linked oligonucleotides. To get insight into the  role of sugar conformation, 2 ',5'-linked oligonucleotides modified at the  C3'-position of the furanose ring were synthesized via solid phase synthesis and  their binding to complementary single stranded DNA and RNA was studied. Their  application as antisense oligonucleotides was also evaluated. The first analogue studied was the C3'-epimer of 2',5'-linked  ribonucleic acids (2 ',5'-RNA), that is, an oligonucleotide in which the  ribofuranose sugar is replaced by xylofuranose (2' ,5'-XNA). This was followed by  the synthesis and analysis of the C3'-fluorinated xylofuranose analogue  (2',5'-FXNA). The sugar conformation in these oligonucleotides are believed to have  a very high population of the C3'-endo ('extended') conformation. Consistent with  this notion, CD structural studies indicated that 2 ',5,'-linked XNA and FXNA show  structural similarities to the 'extended' C2'- endo form of DNA. We found that both  2',5 '-XNA and 2',5'-FXNA bound weakly to complementary single stranded DNA and RNA.  Neither of the xylooligomers resulted in RNaseH activated degradation of  RNA. The last modified oligonucleotide to be studied was the C3'  -fluorinated-2',5'-linked ribonucleic acids (2',5'-FRNA), which has a compact  C2'-endo sugar conformation. In contrast to 2',5'-FXNA, 2 ',5'-FRNA bound strongly  to complementary oligonucleotides and showed structural similarities to RNA (CD  spectroscopy). Our studies showed that it did not cause RNaseH based degradation of  RNA. These studies are consistent with the notion that the effect of  sugar conformation in 2',5'-oligonucleotides is opposite to that of  3',5'-oligonucleotides. In other words, a C3'-endo sugar conformation in  2',5'-oligomers renders the oligonucleotide as 'extended' and portrays itself  equivalent to the 'extended' DNA conformation (which has C2'-endo conformation),  whereas a C2'-endo 2 ',5'-oligonucleotide adopts a 'compact' conformation that is  equivalent to that seen in 3',5 '-oligonucleotides adopting the C3'- endo pucker  (e.g. RNA).</description><creator>Agha, Kazim Ally</creator><contributor>Damha, Masad J.

In the current work, the combustion of pre-dried solid samples  of black liquor (BL), chlorination effluent (C/D), and extraction effluent (E 1) as  well as two-component and three-component mixtures was investigated experimentally  in a Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA) and in a Constant-Temperature Tube  Furnace. Results of the thermogravimetric analyses showed that solids  from the C/D stage were similar to those of the black liquor solids in the volatile  matter, char, and ash contents, while the solids from the E1 stage contained less  volatiles and were richer in their ash content. Results also revealed that both  effluents were devolatilized and gasified at lower rates than that of black liquor.  The addition of up to 20% of either effluent did not have a significant impact of  the TGA behaviour of black liquor. In addition, mixtures containing solids from the  three liquors were very close to black liquor in terms of their devolatilization and  gasification rates and followed a weight-loss trend similar to that of black  liquor. Effect of temperature, O2, mixing ratio on the chemical  compositions of combustion products was investigated in a constant-temperature tube  furnace. Chemical analyses of the gaseous and solid phases were performed using a  Mass Spectrometer (MS) and an Ion Chromatograph (IC), respectively. Results showed  the combustion products of two-component mixtures containing up to 20% of C/D or E1  in black liquor solids would not be significantly different from those of typical  black liquor, except that they contained more HCl in the gas phase and larger  amounts of chloride in the solid phase, especially when C/D was added. Their amounts  were greatly influenced by temperature and oxygen. Combustion of three-component  mixtures (BL-C/D-E1) resulted in products very similar to those obtained during the  combustion of black liquor alone.

Although the response of APL cells to AS 2O3 has been linked to  degradation of the PML/RARalpha fusion oncoprotein characteristic of this disease,  we present evidence that PML/RARalpha does not confer sensitivity to As2O3-induced  apoptosis. In two arsenic-resistant APL cell lines, AsR2 and AsR3, that we  established to study mechanisms of action of arsenic trioxide, PML/RARalpha  expression was regulated normally by As2O3. However, both arsenic-resistant clones  contained high glutathione (GSH) levels, and we found that GSH depletion  dramatically synergized with As2O 3 in the induction of apoptosis in these cells.  This apoptosis was dependent upon the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)  and oxidative stress, which were only detected upon cotreatment with arsenic and the  GSH depletor, buthionine sulfoximine (BSO). c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is known  to be induced by oxidative stress and As2O3, and its activation has been implicated  in the induction of apoptosis in some cell systems. Therefore, we sought to  determine whether activation of JNK could mediate the effects of As2O3 in APL. We  found that AsR2 and AsR3 cells were not only resistant to arsenic-induced apoptosis,  but to JNK1 activation as well. Only under conditions of GSH depletion, a condition  that strongly synergized in inducing apoptosis, could As2O3-induced JNK activity be  elicited in either resistant cell line. Furthermore, inhibition of JNK signaling by  chemical and genetic strategies significantly increased survival of NB4 and mouse  embryo fibroblast cells, respectively, in response to As 2O3, but had no effect on  doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. To investigate the effects of As2O3 on events  downstream of JNK, we performed transient transfection and electrophoretic mobility  shift assays to examine AP-1 activation.

This multidrug resistance phenotype is mediated by the action of a large  family of membrane proteins that act as active transporters or energy driven efflux  pumps in both of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Most eukaryotic multidrug efflux  pumps belong to the ATP binding cassette (ABC) family of transport proteins that  include P-glycoprotein (P-gp1), Multidrug Resistance Associated Protein (MRP1), and  Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP). In prokaryotic cells, Lactococcus lactis  LmrA, a homolog of P-gp1, mediates drug resistance to antibiotics and cytotoxic  drugs. The transport function of these proteins is facilitated by the hydrolysis of  ATP. However, the mechanism by which these proteins bind to, and are able to  transport structurally dissimilar drugs across the cell membrane remains poorly  understood. In this thesis we have attempted to characterize the interactions of  various ABC transporters (MRP1, BCRP, and LmrA) with structurally diverse drugs,  using a well characterized photoreactive drug analogue of Rhodamine 123, [125I]  iodoaryl azido-rhodamine 123 (IAARh123). In the case of MRP1 interaction with  Rhodamine 123, it was of interest to determine the nature of MRP1 drug interactions.  In that study, our results show that CHAPS (1-[(3-cholamidopropyl)  dimethylamino]-1-propansulfate) and Brij35 inhibited the photolabeling of MRP1 with  IAARh123, and this interaction occurred outside the lipid bilayer. These results  were unexpected in light of previous results with another ABC transporter which also  binds to Rhodamine 123. Consequently, we show that non-toxic concentrations of CHAPS  and Brij35 potentiate the toxicity of two MRP1 substrates, vincristine and etoposide  (VP16). In the second chapter, we have used IAARh123 to demonstrate for the first  time that the BCRP mediates drug resi</description><creator>Alqawi, Omar</creator><contributor>Georges, Elias (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>ATP-binding cassette transporters.</subject><subject>Rhodamine 123.</subject><subject>Multidrug resistance.</subject><subject>Xanthene.</subject><subject>ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters.</subject><title>Multidrug transporters : a study of drug interactions using a photoactive analogue of rhodamine 123</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rn3011916.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3484zh362</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Parasitology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:08612p13v</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:21:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We hypothesized that if normal cells carry a regulator which is  inactivated in cancer cells, the transfer of this regulator from a normal cell to a  cancerous one should inactivate the telomerase. Available in the laboratory was a  panel of mouse/human microcell hybrids, each containing a tagged normal human  chromosome fragment integrated into a mouse melanoma (telomerase-positive)  background. We screened these hybrids for telomerase activity using both the  polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP)  assay and mTERT mRNA amplification. We were able to find a telomerase negative microcell hybrid,  B78MC27. Following multiple passages in culture most of the cells undergo  senescence; however a small population reactivates telomerase to ensure their  survival. The revertant B78MC27-R4, where the human tagged chromosome has been  removed, retains telomerase inhibition and also behaves like B78MC27 at later  passages. In spite of our efforts, PCR mapping and fluorescence in situ  hybridization (FISH) analysis on these hybrids failed to identify the exact region  containing the putative repressor. Transfection of a reporter gene (luciferase)  under the control of the hTERT promoter into these hybrids confirmed that the  telomerase regulation is affecting the hTERT transcription level. Finally, upon chromosome transfer containing the telomerase  repressor into the PC-3M-Pro4GP1 human prostate cancer cell line, we observed hTERT  gene transcriptional down-regulation and inhibition of telomerase activity. Thus,  telomerase regulation is subject to a dominant negative inhibition likely involving  the direct binding of a repressor on the hTERT promoter. The discovery of the  natural telomerase regulator could eventually lead to potential cancer therapy,  particularly for tumors having short telomeres, as it is seen in prostate cancer.</description><creator>Deault-Bonin, Marie</creator><contributor>Chevrette, Mario (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Microcell-mediated chromosome transfer shows that inhibition of telomerase activity occurs at the transcriptional level</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tm70mv665.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/08612p13v</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cj82k777k</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:21:08Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The colonial contribution to the French naval shipbuilding  industry in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, explored within the context of  the forest from which the resources for the industry were taken, was a remarkably  successful venture that came to an end with the onset of war. In the past, the end  of the French naval shipbuilding industry in New France has been attributed to the  action or inaction of France that resulted in the inefficient use of forest  resources. Issues of interest in, organization or support of colonial efforts by  France, however, were nevertheless, limited by the immutable realities of the  colonial forest environment. This thesis argues that the success of the industry,  considered within the appropriate context, is a consequence of colonial persistence  in the face of constraints imposed by the colonial forest environment---despite  these other significant issues. The official correspondence, written by colonial officials in  New France, record colonial efforts to supply France with timber and detail the  development of a naval shipbuilding industry in the colony. These documents provide  source material for a case study that demonstrates the constraints imposed by the  colonial forests on the experience of colonists, timber suppliers and shipbuilders.  The colonial forest was not the same as the forests in France. A simple transfer of  knowledge and practice from one forest to another was insufficient to deal with the  differences in climate, forest age, tree species and the extent to which human  activity affected the different forests. These differences challenged the way in  which colonists could use forest resources for their own needs, for export to France  and for naval construction. To consider this use of resources, without considering  the differences between the available materials in the colony and those available in  France, is to look at the story removed from the setting in which it took place. The  unique forest in the colony was the setting in which colonial shipbuilding took  place. Any study of the development of this industry, or any other industry that  relied on forest resources, must give consideration to the constraints and realities  of that forest.</description><creator>Delaney, Monique</creator><contributor>Duncan, Colin (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Desbarats, Catherine (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>New France</subject><subject>Forests and forestry -- Canada</subject><subject>Shipbuilding -- Canada -- History -- 17th century</subject><subject>Shipbuilding -- Canada -- History -- 18th century</subject><title>"Le Canada est un païs de bois" : forest resources and shipbuilding in New France, 1660-1760</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6h440s904.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cj82k777k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nk322d81f</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:21:08Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Members of the zinc cluster (or binuclear cluster) protein  family are characterized by a Zn(II)Cys6 zinc finger involved in DNA recognition and  binding. These fungal proteins are transcriptional regulators of genes involved in a  wide variety of cellular processes. One member, Gal4p, is involved in galactose  metabolism, while others play a major role in primary and secondary metabolism,  control of meiosis, and multidrug resistance. Sequencing of the Saccharomyces  cerevisiae genome has revealed that 55 genes encoding putative zinc cluster proteins  are present in budding yeast. However, the roles of many of these zinc cluster  proteins are unknown. In order to better understand their functions, we have  performed a phenotypic analysis of these putative zinc cluster proteins. We have  implicated a number of them in a variety of processes in the cell, including  multidrug resistance. Stb5p has been shown to be a major player in regulating the  expression of multidrug resistance genes. Other zinc cluster activators of multidrug  resistance genes include Pdr1p, Pdr3p, and Yrr1p. These regulators of multidrug  resistance appear to interact with each other, forming many different  sub-populations of homo- and heterodimers. Stb5p is found predominantly as a  heterodimer with Pdr1p. It also appears that Pdr1p is a master regulator able to  interact with many different partners, enabling it to mediate control over multidrug  resistance genes.</description><creator>Akache, Bassel Ghassan</creator><contributor>Turcotte, Bernard (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Characterization of a family of yeast transcriptional regulators : the zine cluster proteins</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2n49t2423.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nk322d81f</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3n203z64g</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:21:08Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Aminoglycosides comprise a class of small molecules that have  found their way to being one of the most used antibiotics for fighting bacterial  infections. Their effectiveness has, however, been compromised in recent years due  to the rise in the number of aminoglycoside-resistant strains of bacteria. Their  resistance is conferred by enzymes that modify aminoglycosides that are now  ubiquitous in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This has prompted a  renewed look towards seeking novel drugs via structure-activity relationships.  Aminoglycoside phosphotransferases (APH) phosphorylate hydroxyl moieties present on  aminoglycosides that render them ineffective. The majority of APR's exhibits broad  substrate specificity. Interestingly, APH(9)-Ia, isolated from Legionella  pneumophila, phosphorylates one compound, spectinomycin. To further establish the  basis for designing a universal drug for APR's and the rationale behind its  substrate specificity, the crystal structure of APH(9)-Ia in its ternary form (with  bound ADP and spectinomycin) was solved to a resolution of 2.5 A. The overall  architecture reveals a helix (alphaC), characteristically larger than its other APH  counterparts, which contains three key residues (Arg284, Asp288, and Tyr292)  involved in spectinomycin binding. In addition, there are only two acidic residues  that participate in its binding, setting APH(9)-Ia apart from multiaminoglycoside  detoxifying enzymes. We propose that these features are responsible for the enzyme's  single-substrate profile. Furthermore, the structure reveals a significant lobe  movement for substrate binding, previously unseen in this class of enzymes. An  inhibition study using eukaryotic protein kinase inhibitor, CKI-7, showed it indeed  does inhibit the enzyme (KI = (159 +/- 11) muM), though with 2.5 times less  effectiveness than for APH(3')-IIIa. Search for possible alternative substrate for  this enzyme showed that APH(9)-Ia does not phosphorylate</description><creator>Hwang, Jiyoung, 1980-</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><title>Crystal structure of aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (9)-la in complex with ADP and spectinomycin reveals conformational change upon substrate binding</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kk91fm02b.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3n203z64g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:js956g35s</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:21:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In order to further the comprehension of the electron beam (EB)  processing of polymers and composites, it is necessary to better understand the  development of residual stresses during processing. In-situ measurement of stress  development during EB irradiation is a challenging task. The instrumentation has to  be adequately shielded from the high-energy electron beam. In this work, a special  fixture was designed specifically to measure the warpage of a specimen throughout  the EB curing process. The specimen consisted of a thin layer of epoxy resin (Tactix  123 or CAT B) embedded in a layer of glass scrim cloth, sandwiched between layers of  steel and aluminum plates and also antisymmetric unidirectional carbon-epoxy  laminates. The warpage of the specimens was monitored during and after irradiation  at different constant dose rates. The results confirmed that the experimental  instrumentation was not affected by the EB exposure and that it was possible to  monitor the specimen warpage during the EB process. The results show that the EB  cured specimens have lower stress-free temperature compared to equivalent thermally  cured specimens. It was also shown that an increase in dose rate increased the level  of residual stresses. Furthermore, the results suggest that there is a direct  relation between the stress free temperature (TSF) and the temperature of the  specimen at gelation (TGEL). Also, the stress free temperatures for CAT B specimens  were 5ºC higher than the Tactix 123 specimens cured under the same curing  conditions. Finally, a cure kinetics model for Tactix 123 was used to predict the  degree of cure (~0.32) at onset of residual stress development and the  results proved to be valid when compared to parallel plate rheology  results.</description><creator>Paździor, Przemyslaw</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Development of residual stresses during electron beam processing</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tt44pn43m.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/js956g35s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q811kk11g</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:21:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>'Honour', an undefined notion in a patriarchal society like  Pakistan, is used as a tool to justify the crime of murder. Violence in the name of  honour is not a new phenomenon. Historically, it has been justified in the name of  culture but the scope of this tradition has broadened with time and there is an  enormous increase in the number of its victims. This cultural notion is interpreted  in a way to control women's sexuality and to keep women subordinate to men. Honour  killing is not legally sanctioned but the judiciary, the administration and the  society often condone it one way or the other. In the tribal areas of Pakistan where  such murder is not considered a crime, honour killing is a punishment for those who  contravene against the traditional honour code. The wide acceptance of honour killing has made women suffer as a  whole against their basic rights; human, constitutional and Islamic. This thesis  focuses on the judicial redress against the crime of honour killings, which could be  achieved by proper administration of justice. It contests that to control the crime  in the patriarchal society of Pakistan, legislative measures are not enough. There  is a dire need to eliminate the inadequacies of the administration of justice. The  State could build a judicial framework to eliminate the inequality and  discrimination against women. The judiciary could play an important role in bringing  justice to the victims and in curbing this heinous crime.</description><creator>Ibrahim, Faiqa</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Women -- Crimes against -- Pakistan</subject><subject>Justice, Administration of -- Pakistan.</subject><subject>Rule of law -- Pakistan</subject><subject>Honor killings -- Pakistan</subject><subject>Women's rights -- Pakistan</subject><title>Honour killings under the rule of law in Pakistan</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5q47rp19n.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q811kk11g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0c483j87z</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:21:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Nramp1 is a membrane transporter that is essential for mouse  resistance to infection with intracellular pathogens Mycobacterium, Salmonella and  Leishmania. It is expressed in the lysosomal compartment of macrophages and is  recruited to the phagosomal membrane after phagocytosis with kinetics similar to the  lysosomal protein Lamp1. The Nramp1 effect on resistance/susceptibility to  Leishmania infection is observed by counting the number of parasites in livers from  infected mice. The mechanism by which Nramp1 limits liver replication of Leishmania  is still unknown. The goal of the work presented was to explore the effect of Nramp1  on maturation of Leishmania parasitophorous vacuoles in macrophages ex vivo using  primary macrophages isolated from Nramp1+/+ or isogenic Nramp1-/- mice infected with  Leishmania. Immunofluorescence was used to monitor the kinetics of association of  markers for different intracellular compartments with Leishmania vacuoles. The  markers Lamp1, cathepsin D and M6PR were used together with Nramp1. No difference in  the maturation kinetics of Leishmania vacuole was observed between Nramp1+/+ and  Nramp1-/- macrophages for all markers and all times post-infection. In addition, the  infection rate and multiplication of Leishmania monitored in infected macrophages ex  vivo were not significantly different between Nramp1+/+ and Nramp1-/- cells in  contrast to infected livers. Thus, the mechanism by which Nramp1 suppresses  Leishmania replication should be further studied directly in vivo in infected livers  from Nramp1+/+ and Nramp1-/- mice.</description><creator>Horth, Cynthia</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><subject>Biology, Microbiology.</subject><title>Effect of Nramp1 on maturation of phagosomes containing Leishmania donovani</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/td96k311g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0c483j87z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mw22v595s</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:21:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Commercialization of space activities particularly harnessing  satellites for telecommunication in the 1970's is perhaps the most dynamic  development of the twentieth century comparable only to the industrial revolution of  the seventeenth century.

The main objective of the thesis is to review the development of  satellite telecommunication with particular reference to India. The thesis assesses  the present access status and the regulatory regime, analyzes general challenges of  deregulation including concerns of national security, fair competition, equal  opportunity for service providers and manufacturers and above all consumer  protection. It examines the how the Canadian CRTC and American FCC are addressing  the current challenge posed by rapid technological developments and consequent  convergence of telecommunications and broadcasting as well as lessons India could  learn from the Canadian and American experiences.

Expression of zinc transporters was significantly upregulated in the small intestine  of Zn-240 rats. Collectively, these data show that CCS is responsive to zinc-induced  mild copper deficiency, and can serve as a sensitive biomarker of mild copper  deficiency. The increased expression of intestinal zinc transporters expression may  account for the better copper status of Zn-240 rats.</description><creator>Iskandar, Monica</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Zinc -- Physiological transport.</subject><subject>Biochemical markers.</subject><subject>Copper -- Physiological transport.</subject><subject>Copper in the body.</subject><subject>Zinc in the body.</subject><title>Elevated levels of dietary zinc intake modulate the expression of CCS and intestinal zinc trafficking proteins</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nk322d848.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8049g564x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rf55z8281</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:21:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Since Antiquity, the granting of amnesty to past atrocities has  played a prominent role in political transitions. However, the moralized discourse  of human rights that has emerged after the end of the Second World War has called  for prosecutions in such cases. This study shows that granting individual amnesties  to those responsible for past atrocities, as opposed to their prosecution, is a  critical element in paving the way towards homonoia---harmony or concord---in a  community that has been affected by civil strife. After having explored the origins  of amnesty in Ancient Athens and its similarities with the amnesties granted by  early modern European peace treaties and the South African Truth and Reconciliation  Commission, the author argues that individual amnesty constitutes the only way of  uncovering the truth about past atrocities. This is turn facilitates the forgiving  of perpetrators and thus the achievement of homonoia. Moreover, individual amnesty,  as mainly a political act, can nevertheless encompass considerations of justice,  when the notion is not restricted merely to its punitive aspect.</description><creator>Le Fort, Olivia</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Amnesty.</subject><subject>Political ethics.</subject><subject>South Africa.

No comprehensive study  of this constitutional article has yet been undertaken in EU legal research. Through  the medium of the title of my thesis I wish to examine whether it amounts to an  emergent jus gentium for the EU or its antithesis, the consolidation of jus civile.  In parallel with the nature of the subject, this study is necessarily a  legal-political one. Key points identified are the strategic use of human rights,  extraterritoriality of law, foreign direct investment and legal imperialism. A  number of recent developments, both judicial and legislative, have provoked this  study.</description><creator>Fee, Emma</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Constitutions -- European Union countries.</subject><subject>Constitutional law -- European Union countries.</subject><subject>International law -- European Union countries.</subject><subject>Conflict of laws.</subject><subject>Civil law -- European Union countries.</subject><title>'A Europe without dividing lines': the normative framework of the European neighbourhood policy - emergent jus gentium or consolidation of jus civile?</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z316q1971.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nk322d85j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:dj52w525p</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:21:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis, an overview of non-equilibrium Green's function  (NEGF) technique is presented. The entire formulism is derived from the starting  point of the definitions of Green's functions. The special application of NEGF to  transport problems is discussed in details. A brief introduction of Kondo phenomenon  and several theoretical approaches are presented. Using the knowledge of NEGF and  Kondo problem in general, we investigated the Kondo phenomenon in double quantum  dots (DQD) in great detail. In this application, the physical quantities are derived  in terms of Green's functions and self-consistent equations determining the state of  the system are solved numerically. A phase diagram is presented as the result of  competition between Kondo effect and magnetic exchange interaction, and spin  flipping scattering center in the DQD system is shown to have great effect as it  breaks the coherence between the two QDs under certain  circumstances.</description><creator>Ji, Tao, 1981-</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Physics, Condensed Matter.</subject><title>Kondo resonance in double quantum dots : a Green's function analysis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fq977v37t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dj52w525p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pg15bf456</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:21:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Visual manifestations of migraine are largely considered  transient, without permanent sequelae. Recent findings raise the possibility of  persistent ocular and neural manifestations. This thesis investigates visual  function in migraine during the period between episodes by applying various  psychophysical tests to two migraine groups (migraine with aura ( n = 20) and  migraine without aura (n = 20)) and comparing the results to those of a nonheadache  control group (n = 20). Tests were designed to address the level of visual system  involvement, and to investigate the extent to which selective visual processes,  specifically, motion and other forms of temporal modulation are adversely affected  in migraine. The first experiment assessed global processing of complex form  and motion in Glass patterns. Compared to nonheadache participants, the migraine  groups demonstrated significantly elevated motion detection than motion  discrimination thresholds. In contrast, average form detection thresholds were  almost identical between subject groups. The second experiment measured  perimetrically, in each eye, global motion sensitivity in fifteen localized visual  field regions and compared these results in the same subjects to those obtained from  conventional luminance-based perimetry. Perimetry testing revealed that two-thirds  of migraineurs had localized deficits in motion coherence. Almost all motion field  defects occurred in regions of normal sensitivity to the luminance targets. Over 80%  of migrainous visual field defects were nonhomonymous, indicating that dysfunction  occurs largely prior to the optic chiasm. Homonymous defects were also detected,  raising the possibility of postchiasmal dysfunction, although several of these  defects may represent independent monocular losses. The stability of a sample of  field defects was retested after a 4--6 week delay. Sixty-percent of the motion  defects persisted. These regions could support normal resolution acuity, but in most  cases, not the discrimination of small increments in speed in globally coherent  motion. Also included is a study of the spatial and temporal frequency  characteristics of visual discomfort to grating patterns. Visual discomfort was  experienced by a greater proportion of migraineurs than nonheadache controls, and at  significantly lower levels of stimulus contrast in migraineurs than in controls.  Gratings modulated at high temporal frequencies were particularly effective in  eliciting discomfort in migraineurs. Comparison of individual results across the various tests  suggests that functional deficits in migraine (i) are demonstrated on tasks that  involve global motion and other forms of temporal modulation, (ii) occur primarily  prior to the optic chiasm, but may, in some cases, also involve higher-levels of the  visual pathway. Theoretical and clinical implications on migraine pathology and the  visual system are discussed.</description><creator>McColl, Shelley L.</creator><contributor>Chaudhuri, Avi (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Vision disorders.</subject><subject>Migraine.</subject><title>Interictal visual system function in migraine : a psychophysical approach</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dz010q59h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pg15bf456</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p2676w13w</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:21:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Building on earlier work, notably Kager (1993, 1995) and framed  in Optimality Theory (Prince &amp; Smolensky 1993), this thesis presents a theory of  foot structure in which the asymmetric maximal expansions of iambic and trochaic  feet (cf. the Iambic/Trochaic Law: 1TL, e.g. Hayes 1995) are accounted for by a  single constraint, HEAD GOVERNMENT (Mellander 2001c, 2002b). The present analysis  devotes special attention to a class of quantitative processes in trochaic systems  which generate uneven (HL) trochaic feet. In contrast to previous  analyses (e.g. Hayes 1995), such processes are shown to be of phonological rather  than phonetic nature in certain languages, and the ramifications of this conclusion  are explored with regard to a variety of issues in prosodic theory. The evidence for the phonological status of  (HL)-creating processes comes from published data on Mohawk,  Selayarese, Gidabal, and Oromo, as well as original field data from Central Slovak.  Following Piggott (1998, 2001) and Mellander (2001a, c, 2002b), these processes are  seen to follow from H EAD PROMINENCE, a constraint which requires greater relative  intrinsic prominence in the head of a prosodic constituent. Since HEAD PROMINENCE is  sensitive to intrinsic prominence, its effects are shown to hold irrespective of  derived prominence resulting from the application of stress rules. H EAD PROMINENCE  is also shown to play a central role in accounting for diphthongal  quantity-prominence relations, where cross-linguistic patterns of long vowel  diphthongization in bimoraic syllables mirror those of (HL)-creating  processes in disyllabic feet. In contrast to previous work on HEAD GOVERNMENT (Mellander  2001c, 2002b), the absence of languages which require violations of this constraint  implies that it is universally undominated, contra the standard Optimality Theoretic  assumption of universal constraint violability. This view is also supported by the  analysis of ternary stress systems, where the absence of unattested quaternary and  quinternary systems relies crucially on the inviolability of HEAD G  OVERNMENT. A final aspect of this thesis is the development of a  preliminary model to explain asymmetries in structure and markedness between iambic  and trochaic systems, including distributional asymmetries, Iambic Lengthening, and  the ITL. Based on work by Van de Vijver (1998) this approach abandons traditional  symmetric notions of iambicity and trochaicity in favour of an asymmetric pair of  constraints---PEAK-FIRST and *E DGEMOST. Iambic/trochaic asymmetries consequently  emerge as artefacts of constraint interaction and require no additional theoretical  machinery.</description><creator>Mellander, Evan W.</creator><contributor>Piggott, G.
