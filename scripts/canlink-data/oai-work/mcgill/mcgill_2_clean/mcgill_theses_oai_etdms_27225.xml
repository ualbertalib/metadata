The initial approach for ensuring acceptable work conditions had been through direct state intervention and the use of coercive power. In view of the limitations of this approach, over time, state regulation was replaced by the "self-regulation" or "internal-responsibility system" under which participants at the workplace were given an enhanced say in the regulatory process. Recent trends have continued to favour this shift towards deregulation of the state's administrative structures. The self-regulation strategy, however, also has limited applicability and can only prove effective if applied in combination with the state's enforcement strategies. The two approaches need to be viewed as being complimentary to one another and not mutually exclusive. This being the case the state's role in the regulatory process would require re-examination and alteration to ensure an effective and efficient regulatory structure.</description><creator>Dhillon, Balinder Singh</creator><contributor>Webber, Jeremy (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Law.</subject><subject>Political Science, Public Administration.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Occupational Health and Safety.</subject><title>The State's role in occupational health and safety administration /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zg64tn21x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/02870x10r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ns064711q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:56:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>There is little doubt that the current Warsaw System should be modified, mainly because the compensation limit is too low. The most trenchant problem has been to maintain the concept of uniformity while different economic conditions have become increasingly the order of the day and to cope with the increasing disparity between industrialized and developing nations. Overview of the problems of the current system is made, using the KAL flight 007 case. This thesis explores the relationship between passengers and air carriers, which should be interpreted as a common interest. It also examines the term "unlimited" which, frequently, leads to confusion. Even though the purpose of "willful misconduct" is to provide higher compensation for the passenger, it would be better to interpret it as "no-limit" so as not to confuse it with unlimited liability (full-compensation). The present thesis next explores unlimited liability (full-compensation) as being unrealistic in practice in the international community. The rationale of Montreal Protocols No. 3 and No. 4 and their opponents' opinions are also examined. In conclusion, we will propose that the Montreal Protocols No. 3 and No. 4 are an acceptable solution to modernize the Warsaw System.</description><creator>Shin, Sung Hwan</creator><date>1993</date><subject>Law.</subject><subject>Transportation.</subject><subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</subject><title>Montreal protocols no. 3 and no. 4 : in Korean perspective</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mc87pr54g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ns064711q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6969z2041</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:56:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This commentary to Pindar's Nemean 6 was inspired as much by the absence of recent modern criticism as by the presence of those venerable works on the Nemean odes by Fennell, Bury and Farnell.

E. Khayat and R. G. Cox. The present experimental investigation was conducted to study the applicability of this theory. The translational and the rotational velocity of eight different slender rods, each sedimenting at various orientations in five different silicon oils were determined by taking single-frame multiple-image photographs. The data from the films were extracted using a two dimensional measuring microscope, and numerical calculations were carried out to calculate the experimental drag, lift and torque. The experimental findings were compared with the predictions from the theory for a range of Reynolds number R, based on cylinders cross sectional dimension $(0.00005 le R le 23.3).$ The measured experimental and the theoretical drag force were consistent to within the order of accuracy of the experiments. This drag force was an increasing function of the Reynolds number for all orientations, with the maximum drag force occurring for horizontal cylinders. The experimental lift force also showed a fair agreement with the theoretical predictions for the range of Reynolds number $0.00005 le R le 0.2$ at all cylinder orientations. In the range of $0.00005 le R le 0.2,$ the cylinder observed the highest lift force at $ theta = pi/4$ where $ theta$ is the angle of cylinder's axis makes with the free stream direction. The comparison of the experimental and the theoretical rotational velocity showed good agreement for $0.00005 le R le 0.001,$ but relatively poor agreement for $0.001 le R le 23.3.$</description><creator>Jebellie, Seyed J.</creator><contributor>Cox, R.

The major advantages of Reaction-Bonded Silicon Nitride (RBSN) over other densification methods such as hot-pressing or sintering lies in the ability to form complex final shapes without diamond machining. Negligible shrinkage of the compacts occurs during the nitridation, resulting in near-net shape RBSN components. In the present study, the production of green compacts with homogeneous reinforcement distribution was investigated; parameters include viscosity measurements, pH adjustment and consolidation methods (isostatic pressing and slip casting). The nitridation of the Si/SiCw compacts was monitored by a microbalance system which recorded the weight gain during the reaction. Kinetics of nitridation and a study of complete nitridation were carried out. The nitridation process is very sensitive to a change in temperature-time schedule and green density whereas whisker content does not significantly influence the nitridation. A low modulus of rupture value was measured ($ sim$190MPa) due to low nitrided densities ($ sim$75%) and the presence of low density regions associated with whisker bundles.</description><creator>Gavoret, Laurence</creator><contributor>Pugh, M.

Four spring barley and one spring wheat datasets were assembled from ICM field trials conducted in the Montreal region (1987-89). A quadratic and a Mitscherlich-Baule equation were fitted to the (five) datasets and compared with respect to a number of measures of goodness of fit. One dataset was chosen for generating and graphing a three-dimensional response surface, based on the fitted equations of that dataset. The two surfaces were compared in light of expectations regarding the two equations. The fitted equations of three of the five datasets did not produce noteworthy results. The other two datasets provided mixed results. The response surfaces provided outcomes that were contrary to prior expectations. In general graphing the response surfaces offered limited additional insight. Ultimately, this project may have been hampered by the experimental design of the field trials, those designs being oriented to results of agronomic rather than economic significance.</description><creator>Stephen, Bruce G.</creator><contributor>Henning, John C.

A survey of alternate approaches to the three components of HMDs is presented. A brief review of first order optics, aberration theory, general design principles, and computer aided lens design is also given. Two multi-spherical lens systems, a straight structure and a folded layout, are presented. Their aberrations (distortion, coma, lateral color, field curvature and astigmatism) have been well corrected.

The deflection model which was formulated to predict the error on the diameter considers the smaller emerging diameter formed by the depth of cut as the tool tip moves along the workpiece, thus improving the accuracy with which the deflection can be predicted. The model also recognizes the fact that the total deflection undergoes an equilibrium search causing the final deflection to reach a smaller value than that which is obtained when using the methods described in literature. Furthermore, the way in which the workpiece is commonly supported in industrial practice, which is having one end rigidly clamped in a chuck at the spindle while the other end is supported by its center at the tailstock, is included in the deflection analysis. The compensation method can be applied not only to uniform cylindrical bars but also to general shaped workpieces. However the latter must first be partitioned into segments forming a multidiameter shaft for the deflection analysis. Implementation of this predictive compensation method introduces the possibility of obtaining single pass machining with final pass accuracy.</description><creator>Gould, Martin</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Predictive compensation for deflection in turning</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sx61dn63p.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r494vm27z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z890rv682</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:56:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Ce memoire tentera de decrire ce que fut l'ideologie defendue par le Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi d'Iran (1919-1980).

Beginning with ideas of gender "truths" in philosophical thought, I posit that the representation of violence is inseparable from the notion of gender, and that ideas of gender are always historically specific. I examine masculinity and aggression in Vietnam films, arguing that masculinity must struggle to renew its privilege and its illusion of purity. Finally, I examine combat roles for women where the heroines have accessed "male" technology to become subjects of the social act. I conclude that these representations offer a possible female subjectivity and resistance to patriarchal assimilation only when the ambivalence and fragility of that subjectivity is recognized.</description><creator>Ward, Katherine</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Women in motion pictures</subject><subject>Violence in motion pictures</subject><title>Tracing the heroine in masculine spectacle : gender, technology, and the role of the destroyer in recent American film</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5425kb91s.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m900nv79v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1v53jz39f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:56:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis presents the design and implementation of a rule-based system used for the design and presentation of problem-solving Computer Aided-Learning (CAL) programs.

The CEA gene family, which is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is composed of several proteins crossreactive with anti-CEA antibodies. Carcinoembryonic antigen appears to function in the development of the gastro-intestinal tract as well in tumor formation; it is capable of mediating cell-cell adhesion in vitro which is consistent with its putative role of maintaining tissue architecture in vivo. CEA gene family members have also been identified in various tissues of the mouse. Two of the mouse proteins, mmCGMla and mmCGMlb, have been characterized. By sequence homology, mmCGMla and mmCGMlb are the mouse homologues of human biliary glycoprotein and of rat hepatocyte ecto-ATPase. Both of the mouse CEA related proteins function as adhesion molecules when expressed on the cell surface of transfectant cells; however, mmCGMla, unlike mmCGMlb, mediates cellular aggregation irrespective of calcium concentration or temperature. Sequence comparison of mmCGMla, mmCGMlb, and other cDNAs isolated by polymerase chain reaction techniques, demonstrates that there are at least eight possible transcripts encoding CEA-related proteins and that these transcripts are all produced by alternative splicing of one precursor messenger RNA.</description><creator>McCuaig, Kimberly</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Alternative splicing and adhesion properties of a mouse carcinoembryonic antigen gene family member</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6t053h23g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t435gf20p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:d791sh52s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:56:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Four experiments were conducted with the objectives of (i) comparing the suitability of various H. bulbosum clones for haploid production, (ii) determining the parental effects of H. bulbosum and barley genotypes on percentage of pollinated florets yielding caryopses with rescuable embryos and on embryo viability, (iii) comparing different stages for embryo culture and caryopsis culture, and (iv) attempting to produce barley haploids directly from cultured immature caryopses.

The model allows variable size communications between processors, by exchanging subgraphs instead of single nodes. Functional languages with lazy semantics have graph nodes representing unevaluated arguments. These nodes require special treatment by the run time system because they must not be copied. By checking the structure of the transmitted subgraphs, it is possible to determine which unevaluated expressions have no external references to them and so may safely be included in the subgraph with no overhead. This allows large subgraphs to be exchanged while reducing the demands on the communications system. This technique raises the possibility of implementations on a wide variety of distributed computers such as networks of workstations, which hitherto has been considered impractical.</description><creator>Howson, Christopher</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Computer programming.</subject><title>A distributed graph reducer for lazy functional languages /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j3860820j.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sx61dn64z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ff3656288</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:56:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The recently developed method of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy allows for continuous monitoring of high energy phosphate compound (ATP and Phosphocreatine) and intracellular pH of tissues or whole organs. In other to better understand why ex-vivo hearts can be preserved for longer periods when perfused with oxygenated crystalloid solutions under hypothermic conditions, two groups of canine hearts were studied with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Group 1 = Canine hearts preserved for 4 hours by immersion into a 4$ sp circ$C saline solution. Group 2 = Canine hearts preserved for 24 hours by continuous coronary perfusion with a modified oxygenated Krebs solution at 4$ sp circ$C.

Human GH treatment had no significant effect on food consumption, growth parameters or plasma IGF-I. Food consumption, tail length, liver weight, and tibia weight were significantly lower in the zinc deficient group. Body weight was significantly reduced in the zinc deficient and pair fed groups compared to the control. A significant interaction between zinc and hGH was found for tibial epiphyseal cartilage width but there were no significant differences between the groups receiving hGH and the respective shams. Tissue zinc content and plasma alkaline phosphatase were significantly decreased by the dietary zinc deficiency. Plasma zinc was higher in the groups receiving hGH. Significant interactions between zinc and hGH was found for liver iron, tibial zinc, and tibial copper. Copper and iron showed a competitive interaction with zinc and were lower in the rats receiving the control diet. Both lowered zinc and food intake contributed to the effects of the zinc deficiency; however, these effects were not equally distributed. Food intake had the greater effect on growth and plasma IGF-I while tissue mineral content showed a greater effect for zinc intake.</description><creator>Dicks, Dana L.

The findings suggest that a cross-section of residents have a positive attitude toward community tourism development because it may provide local economic benefits. Residents also support the Igalirtuuq Conservation Proposal because it protects the endangered bowhead whale and its critical habitat, while at the same time stimulating tourism development. Clyde Inuit are reluctant to attribute social and environmental costs to these initiatives but are, nevertheless, able to point out some specific negative impacts that such projects might have on their village. Most felt that few problems would materialise as long as residents were intimately involved in all aspects of a controlled and gradual development. The study illustrates the importance of this type of community oriented approach in providing guidelines for tourism and conservation area development policy makers.</description><creator>Nickels, Scot, 1959-</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Ecotourism -- Northwest Territories.</subject><subject>Wildlife conservation -- Northwest Territories.</subject><title>Northern conservation and tourism : the perceptions of Clyde River Inuit</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hq37vp81w.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0z708x94w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qz20st917</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:56:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis deals with two aspects of operators within the framework of Government and Binding theory; (i) how they are assigned their scope, and (ii) how they are licensed. In an attempt to answer these questions, the relation of Move $ alpha$ (such as scrambling, NP-movement, and wh-movement) to the scope of operators and the licensing of wh-elements, negative polarity items, and adverbs are examined. It is argued that scope assignment is dictated by the Scope Principle and the Empty Category Principle. It is also argued that licensing of operators is determined by the Feature-Dependent Item Criterion. These principles and criterion make use of the concept of Government Theory Compatibility, which is built into Relativized Minimality. It is suggested that this concept should be characterized in terms of a set of lexical features. The approach advocated here accounts for the interpretive and distributional behavior of operators without recourse to parameterization of LF principles.</description><creator>Nakamura, Masanori, 1966-</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Government-binding theory (Linguistics)</subject><subject>Government (Grammar)</subject><title>Move a, scope, and relativized minimality</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8910jw047.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qz20st917</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Linguistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8910jw03z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:56:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Previous studies failed to report benefits of prolonged breast feeding on nutritional status. A nationally representative sample of 1411 children from Sri Lanka (1987) was used to compare breast feeders versus non breast feeders, as well as duration of breast feeding, through multivariate analyses for height-for-age, weight-for-age and weight-for-height z-scores. Analyses of interaction showed prolonged breast feeding to be advantageous among children of working mothers, and children from households using an unimproved water supply. For example, children 35 months of age, breast fed for 24 versus 8 months were 0.9 centimetres (95% confidence interval; +0.0, 1.8) taller if mothers worked and 420 grams (140, 690) heavier if households used an unimproved water supply. Among uneducated mothers breast fed children were 1.3 cm (2.2, 3.3) shorter than non breast fed children. Prolonged breast feeding should be encouraged as it is advantageous for the nutritional status of certain subgroups of children older than 12 months of age.</description><creator>Dwivedi, Garima</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Breastfeeding.</subject><subject>Children -- Nutrition.</subject><title>The association of breast feeding and nutritional status of children 13-36 months of age /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sj1393199.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8910jw03z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rx913r08z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:56:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The first objective of this study was to investigate the contralateral and summatory effects of electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation on the flexion reflex (FR) in man. The second objective was to delineate whether the FR (a physiological measure) will vary systematically with subjective pain sensation (a psychological measure) under different stimulation conditions. In the first study, in 16 subjects, we compared the FR area "values" obtained electromyographically in the biceps femoris under three different stimulation procedures: placebo-TENS (placebo), electroacupuncture to the contralateral leg (EA$ sb{ rm Leg}$ and electroacupuncture to the contralateral arm and leg (EA$ sb{ rm Arm+Leg}$). A statistically significant decrease in the FR area (p $&lt;$ 0.01) was observed in 7, 8 and 9 subjects respectively for placebo, EA$ sb{ rm Leg}$ and EA$ sb{ rm Arm+Leg}$ stimulation. The results demonstrated a significantly greater inhibitory response in the BF FR area with EA$ sb{ rm Leg}$ stimulation than with placebo stimulation (p $&lt;$ 0.01). In the second part to this study we undertook to determine the relationship between the FR and pain sensation. It appeared that electroacupuncture could modulate perceptual output at the cortical level in the same or opposite manner from the spinal motorneuronal level (FR), depending upon whether this reflex motor output (FR) is inhibited or facilitated.</description><creator>Mah, Steven S.

While the groups did not differ on either maternal variables or child behavioural problems, CPD children had higher self-esteem than comparison group children. For both groups, mothers with high well-being, high competence, and low stress had children with fewer behavioural problems. Furthermore, mothers of older CPD children perceived themselves as more competent parents, which in turn was related to fewer behavioural problems and higher self-esteem in the child. Mothers who assessed their child's condition as less stressful also had a higher sense of well-being and/or perceived themselves as more competent mothers.

An EIC measures dose from the amount of electret surface charge neutralized by ions created in the chamber's sensitive volume. A semi-empirical equation is presented for the calculation of prompt time-dependent RIC as a function of air-kerma rate and electric field. Measurements showing the dependence of radiation-induced current on electrode material show a tenfold difference in current between aluminum and graphite electrodes. RIC permits charge migration through the polymer which can cause an overestimation of dose. Intermittently heating and charging the electret will cause surface charges to be deposited at deep energy levels and therefore improving electret charge retention. This study demonstrates the influence of radiation induced currents on the performance of the radiation-charged RIC.</description><creator>Markovic, Alexander</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Physics, Radiation.</subject><title>X-ray-induced currents and conductivity effects in a radiation-charged electret ionization chamber</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m613mz84g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pn89d7822</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:dr26xz54q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:57:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Foreign tourists' images and ratings of Iceland before and after a visit to Iceland were investigated. Two self administered questionnaires were used to gather the data. Of 372 tourists, mainly from the USA and Great Britain, answering the first questionnaire 243 answered the follow-up questionnaire. The tourists come mostly because of the scenery and particular landscape features and there is evidence of further tourist potential having to do with history and perhaps culture and customs. Changes in image during stay were considerable. The image of cost, which is the most negative aspect of the country, worsened, but the image of many landscape attributes improved. The importance of attributes changed in some instances. The evidence supports the hypothesis that the greater the negative difference between expectation and experience of an destination attribute and the more important the attribute is to the tourists, the likelier they are to become dissatisfied.</description><creator>Thorsteinsson, Jakob</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Tourism -- Iceland.</subject><title>Tourists' images and ratings of destination attributes : the case of Iceland</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hq37vp825.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dr26xz54q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:12579t447</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:57:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><creator>Powell, Steven</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Rastafari movement -- Jamaica</subject><subject>Popular culture -- Jamaica -- History -- 20th century</subject><subject>Music -- Jamaica -- 20th century -- History and criticism</subject><subject>Reggae music -- Jamaica -- History and criticism</subject><title>Dread rites : an account of Rastafarian music and ritual process in popular culture</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rb68xc89h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/12579t447</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anthropology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:v979v417r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:57:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><creator>Potter, Thomas G.</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Parachuting</subject><subject>Senses and sensation -- Testing.</subject><subject>Anxiety -- Testing</subject><title>Sensation seeking and anxiety levels before and after exposure to a high risk activity</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k06988705.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v979v417r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physical Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):27250</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
