Because the requirements are  becoming more and more sophisticated and highly discipline specific, no existing  access control tool is available that developers could adopt directly. This thesis  proposes a general and flexible security administration module that can be easily  integrated into scientific project management systems, especially if they are based  on a 3-tier architecture. The module is based on role-based access control (RBAC)  technology to provide flexibility and extensibility. In order to control access on  the level of individual table tuples, a new concept, named condition, is introduced.  Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) technology is adopted to integrate the access  control component into the 3-tier framework. A concrete implementation is performed  on the prototype project management system Exp-DB using AspectJ.</description><creator>Li, Xueli, 1973-</creator><contributor>Kemme, Bettina (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Access control for scientific project management systems</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n583xv56x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9019s306w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gh93h011z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this work, various megavoltage imaging modalities such as the  Portal Vision aS-500 Amorphous Silicon EPID, Portal Vision LC-250 Liquid Matrix  EPID, PortPro Flouro based EPID, Kodak XV film, Kodak EDR film, and SmartCR Computer  Radiography system are examined in terms of detector parameters (acquisition time,  minimum dose to obtain an image, saturation dose, and grey scale) and image quality  parameters (subject contrast, signal-to-noise ratio, spatial resolution, modulation  transfer function, and gantry angle dependence). We found that aS-500 EPID provides  better image quality as compared to the other modalities investigated in terms of  quantitative parameters. Qualitatively, it also outperformed the other systems,  although the differences in image quality between the systems were sometimes  marginal. The fast acquisition time and the requirement of only 1 MU to generate an  image also made aS-500 EPID the most appropriate imager for static IMRT dose  verification. The isodose comparison between the aS-500 EPID and Kodak XV film for  several IMRT QA studies corresponded within acceptable tolerance levels of +/-2 mm  in most cases.</description><creator>Kumaraswamy, Lalith K.</creator><contributor>Podgorsak, E.

It is  expressed predominantly in the osteoclast and is believed to be the main degradative  agent of the bone organic matrix. Collagen types I and II were treated with recombinant human  cathepsin K in the presence or absence of chondroitin-4 sulfate. The reaction was  stopped at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h by the addition of a specific cysteine protease  inhibitor E-64. The effect of chondroitinase ABC pre-treatment, to remove possible  chondroitin sulfate contaminant in the collagen preparation, was investigated. In  order to obtain a clear picture of the degradative potential of this enzyme and to  investigate whether the accessibility of the proteoglycans in the extracellular  matrix affects their susceptibility to proteolysis, the action of recombinant  cathepsin K on the components of cartilage as isolated molecules, was compared with  their cleavage in the intact tissue. The isolated molecules were obtained by  extracting bovine nasal cartilage with guanidinium chloride (Gdn-HCl). Cartilage  tissue was cut into 1 mm3 pieces and treated with cathepsin K. The tissue was then  extracted in Gdn-HCl. All experiments were performed at pH 5.5. Proteoglycans and  collagen were analyzed by SDS/PAGE and western blotting. All proteoglycans studied were substrates for cathepsin K.  However, a marked difference in their accessibility to this enzyme in cartilage was  found. Aggrecan had the same relative accessibility in both extracts and in intact  cartilage, whereas the small proteoglycans were resistant to cleavage indicating  protection by association with other cartilage macromolecules. The present study  suggest that cathepsin K would be an effective cartilage degrading enzyme and that  cartilage may "extend" the life of certain components through interactions  with others.</description><creator>Huppé, Geneviève</creator><contributor>Mort, John S.

The present study directly tested this  hypothesis by determining the effect of forced CAR expression on the invasion and  growth of the human glioma cell line U87-MG expressing no detectable levels of CAR.  We also studied the requirement of the cytoplasmic domain of CAR in mediating for  these effects. We have found that forced expression of the full-length forms of  mCAR1 isoform in U87-MG cell lines (i) does not affect their growth in vitro in  monolayer, but does significantly reduce the tumor volumes generated by implanted  glioma cells in mouse brains in vivo; and (ii) reduced invasion by glioma cells in a  three-dimensional spheroid model. In contrast, expression in U87 cells of the  tailless-CAR having the entire cytoplasmic domain deleted except for the first two  intracellular juxtamembrane cysteine-cysteine amino acids did not significantly  reduce the invasion rate of the glioma spheroid in vitro, nor did it reduce the  tumor volume generated in vivo in the brain. Together these results suggest that the  paucity of CAR expression in malignant gliomas may confer the tumors selective  advantage in growth and invasion.</description><creator>Huang, Kuo-Cheng, 1978-</creator><contributor>Nalbantoglu, Josephine (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>The effect of expression of the coxsackie and adenovirus receptor on glioma growth and invasion /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1j92g814r.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dr26xx85h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5q47rp262</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Although cardiac hypertrophy is a compensatory mechanism of the  stressed heart, it ultimately leads to cardiac dysfunction. GATA-4, a member of the  GATA family, plays an essential role in this process, nevertheless, its mechanism of  action is still largely unknown. We have isolated a new evolutionarily conserved  protein, ENDO1, that belongs to a new subfamily of PHD finger proteins. In adult  mouse, ENDO1 was highly expressed in the kidney, lung, spleen, heart and brain. In  ventricular cardiomyocytes, endogenous ENDO1 was expressed in the nucleus and  cytoplasm. Overexpression analysis of antisense and sense GATA-4 suggests that  GATA-4 downregulates endogenous ENDO1 in cardiomyocytes at the mRNA and protein  levels. The protein levels of ENDO1 were enhanced in cardiomyocytes stimulated with  phenylephrine, a hypertrophy stimulus. Structure-function analysis revealed that  ENDO1 inhibits the activity levels of the BNP promoter. Our results indicate that  the ENDO1 protein may play a significant role in cardiac development and  differentiation.</description><creator>Jain, Pooja</creator><contributor>Nemer, Mona (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2004</date><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Characterization of a novel downstream target of gata-4 in the heart</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w6634430k.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5q47rp262</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0v838117q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The human androgen receptor (hAR) is a member of the steroid  receptor family of nuclear receptors (NRs) that acts as a ligand-activated  transcription factor. Mutations in the androgen receptor impair normal male sexual  development resulting in a clinical continuum of virilization disorders known as the  androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). Characterization of key AR mutations has  enabled a better understanding of structure-function relationships of the AR, and  serves as a prototype for steroid receptor mechanisms of action. NH2-/COOH-terminal (N/C-terminal) interactions appear to be  critical for AR function in vivo as evidenced by the association of AIS with single  amino acid mutations that disrupt the N/C-interaction. In the first paper, we examine the effects of five distinct  C-terminal mutations on hAR N/C-interactions in the presence and absence of the hAR  coactivator, TIF2. We found that each of the mutations disrupted normal hAR  N/C-interactions, partially explaining the molecular defects underlying the  corresponding AIS phenotypes. Interestingly, we show a strong correlation between  the strength of N/C-interaction and the phenotypic degree of AIS  observed. In the second paper, we investigated the role of N-terminal  mutations on hAR N/C-interactions, in the presence and absence of TIF2. While there  have been no previous reports of the effects of N-terminal hAR mutations on  N/C-interaction, we show that two distinct mutations in this terminal of the hAR are  directly responsible for the disruption of normal N/C-interaction in a patient with  complete androgen insensitivity. We suggest that these mutations affect the  N/C-coactivator-binding interface, thus reducing the overall transcriptional  competence of the hAR.</description><creator>Ghali, Shereen</creator><contributor>Trifiro, Mark A.

The use of Pseudomonas putida  IF-3, a caffeine-degrading microorganism, in a microbial consortium for  bioremediation of caffeine found in coffee wastes was investigated. Caffeine  degradation was observed in fed-batch reactor experiments with caffeine as sole  source of carbon and nitrogen. Metabolic regulation and caffeine removal potential  by Pseudomonas putida IF-3 were investigated by supplementing with other nutrient  sources. Diauxic growth was not observed. Nitrogen release from caffeine breakdown  was found to be rate-limiting. Effects of caffeine on microbial consortia were studied using  denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), providing a community-scale view of  changes in microbial consortia upon caffeine addition. Surprisingly, caffeine  removal was achieved indigenously by the microbial consortium. Principal component  analysis was used to analyze differences in DGGE banding patterns between control  and caffeine-exposed mixed cultures.</description><creator>Gaulin, Jean-Philippe</creator><contributor>Brown, Wayne A.

The serotonin  transporter is responsible for the high-affinity reuptake of serotonin from the  synapse, effectively terminating the potentiation of the serotonergic signal. The  objectives of this work were to sequence the serotonin transporter promoter region  in the vervet monkey (C. aethiops), identify polymorphisms and determine whether  they were associated with any of the previously characterized behavioural dimensions  of the vervet. 2.8kB of previously unknown sequence was obtained and one novel  polymorphism was discovered (V-SERT-Alu). 199 vervet monkeys were screened for the  V-SERT-Alu polymorphism and a significant association (p &lt; 0.05) was found to  behavioural factor three (fearfulness) which is the monkey analogue of human  anxiety.</description><creator>Fainman, Joshua</creator><contributor>Palmour, Roberta M.

The primary objective of this experiment was to examine the  effect of aging on the perception of a pinch-grip force exerted by the thumb and  index finger. Twelve young (25.3 +/- 2.4 yr.) and twelve older (71.4 +/- 3.3 yr.)  healthy adults executed unilateral and bilateral pinch-grip tasks with and without  visual feedback. The performance of the older group was worse than that of the  younger individuals when asked to reproduce a pinch force. Specifically, the older  adults tended to produce an initial overshoot in force which then decreased towards  the required force. However, no difference existed between the two age groups when  they were asked to produce a same force with both hands simultaneously. These  results suggest that the normal aging process has a more significant effect on  sensorimotor memory than on the output of descending motor commands.</description><creator>Fang, Nathan</creator><contributor>De Serres, Sophie J.

Population dynamics of O. communa on sunflower and on ragweed  (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) were determined using a life table approach. Sixty  percent of O. communa females died during the first 30 days on sunflower while only  14% died on ragweed plants. Only 20% of fertile females laid eggs on sunflower  plants as compared with 100% on ragweed plants. Fecundity, life duration, egg  viability, and other biological parameters were significantly higher on ragweed  plants than on sunflower plants. Ragweed is the main host plant for O. communa.  Nevertheless, in specific situations (no-choice) adults and larvae of O. communa can  damage sunflower plants.

This study examines change in symptoms and related dysfunctional beliefs  during Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) with 32 previously treatment resistant OCD  patients. Three questions were examined: (a) What is the relationship between  dysfunctional beliefs and symptoms at pre-treatment; (b) How much change occurs in  symptoms, and related beliefs, during specialized CBT; and (c) What is the  relationship between change in cognitive and symptom variables. On average, symptoms  and related beliefs of symptomatic-responders resolved to within normal limits  following treatment. Beliefs of patients whose symptoms did not improve remained  unchanged. Pre-treatment strength of overestimation of threat and response to  unpredictability were significant predictors of symptomatic improvement. Change in  overcontrol of intrusive thoughts and overestimation of threat significantly  predicted change in symptoms.

The main goal was to test the hypothesis that the nucleotide binding domains (NBD)  of P-gp are structurally and functionally conserved with HisP with respect to key  residues in intimate contact with the ATP molecule and possibly involved in  catalysis. The strategy adopted involves the insertion of cysteine residues at the  desired position in a cysteine-less protein backbone. A set of 14 mutants was  generated this way for each NBD. The effects of the mutations on drug transport are  tested with a cytotoxicity assay using the anti-fungal drug FK506. A431C/A1074C and  T435C/T1078C showed the same level of activity as the wild-type while the other  residues were completely or partially defective.

The bioreactor and synthetic  effluent were designed and shown to perform like the real mill system providing the  AS, establishing the in vivo relevance of the results. Limitation of either N or P  produced inadequate effluent biotreatment, shown by poor BOD5 and suspended solids  removal, and by decreased biomass health, performance, and floc settling. Greatly  enhanced poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) (but not carbohydrate or extracellular  polymeric substances [EPS]) synthesis was the common response of the floc microbial  community to N limitation over many days. In contrast, P-limitation increased total  carbohydrate and EPS, but not PHB. N limitation, but not P limitation, caused the net floc surface  charge to be much more negative, while P-limitation, but not N-limitation, increased  the floc bound water content and surface hydrophobicity. Thus, in real pulp and  paper mill AS systems, careful manipulation of N or P additions may be useful to  optimize the key process of charged polymer-assisted AS dewatering.</description><creator>Bhathena, Jasmine</creator><contributor>Driscoll, Brian T.

Depending on disturbance type, soil physical and chemical parameters  show different response patterns during the recovery phase. An added level of  complication is the ecological site types occurring throughout a forested area. The  identification of indicators of soil fertility and the successful emulation of a  natural disturbance regime were the scope of this research. The research presented herein took place in the Manitoba Model  Forest (MBMF), located in eastern Manitoba, where the natural disturbance regime is  wildfire. Timber harvest strategies used in the area are designed to emulate a  wildfire (5% retention of standing timber and extensive slash inputs) and clearcut  harvesting. The objective of this study was to document changes in forest floor and  soil properties prior to and following harvesting, and to compare these properties  to those found in a small wildfire that burned in the MBMF in late summer 1998,  which serves as a benchmark to the harvest. In the two study areas, both thin  mineral soil (5--20 cm) and moderately deep mineral soil (20--100 cm) ecosite types  were monitored at four dates over a two year period for soil physical and  nutritional response patterns.</description><creator>Bois, Claudette Hélène</creator><contributor>Fyles, James W.

At the brain level, this dissociation could reflect distinct  patterns of activation for encoding and/or retrieval of items and associations. We  used event-related functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging to assess neural correlates  of item and associative encoding and retrieval in eighteen healthy subjects. During  encoding, subjects memorized doubles (two identical images) and pairs (two different  images). During retrieval, subjects made item recognition judgments (old versus new  items) and associative recognition judgments (intact versus rearranged pairs).  Greater hippocampal activation was observed for associative relative to item  encoding, but also for item relative to associative recognition. This pattern of  hippocampal activation is consistent with previous neuroimaging studies of  associative encoding, but also suggests that at retrieval other processes such as  novelty detection could recruit the hippocampus to a greater extent than associative  recognition. In the prefrontal cortex, we observed right and left activation for  associative and item encoding, respectively. At retrieval, the opposite pattern was  observed with left prefrontal activation for associative and bilateral activation  for item recognition. This pattern of prefrontal activation shows the implication of  the prefrontal cortex in memory for both types of material, although with a  different lateralization. Overall, these results show the importance of examining  the memory stages when comparing neural correlates of item and associative  memory.</description><creator>Achim, Amélie M.</creator><contributor>Lepage, Martin (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Psychology, Cognitive.</subject><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><subject>Psychology, Psychobiology.</subject><title>Neural correlates of associative and item memory</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fn106z74g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qr46r1527</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychiatry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sf268573n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The construction of phylogenetic trees commonly uses molecular  sequence data (DNA, RNA or amino acid sequences) for a single gene family over a set  of n extant taxa. However, difficulties arise when the phylogenetic gene tree for  one gene family disagrees with the phylogenetic gene tree for a different gene  family. Several computational problems arise when trying to explain this  disagreement (the two gene trees are not equal). Typically, one assumes a  (simplified) model of evolution restricted to a small set of events which are  assumed to cause the disagreement. Two such well-studied events are gene  duplications and lateral gene transfer (a.k.a. horizontal gene  transfer). This thesis explores several aspects of both of these simplifed  models of evolution. A brief exposition of the models is presented, along with  previous results and various extensions to these models. The expected number of gene duplications needed to explain  disagreements between a random gene and species tree is  investigated. A method for incorporating edge weights into the species tree is  proposed.</description><creator>Addario-Berry, Dana</creator><contributor>Hallett, Michael (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2004</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>An analysis of models and algorithms for gene duplication and lateral gene transfer /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rj430540p.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sf268573n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mg74qm59w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>As the Internet is a best-effort delivery network, audio packets  may be delayed or lost en route to the receiver due to network congestion. To  compensate for the variation in network delay, audio applications buffer received  packets before playing them out. Basic algorithms adjust the packet playout time  during periods of silence such that all packets within a talkspurt are equally  delayed. Another approach is to scale individual voice packets using a dynamic  time-scale modification technique based on the WSOLA algorithm. In this work, an adaptive playout algorithm based on the  normalized least mean square algorithm, is improved by introducing a spike-detection  mode to rapidly adjust to delay spikes. Simulations on Internet traces show that the  enhanced bi-modal playout algorithm improves performance by reducing both the  average delay and the loss rate as compared to the original  algorithm.</description><creator>Shallwani, Aziz</creator><contributor>Kabal, Peter (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>An adaptive playout algorithm with delay spike detection for real-time VoIP /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xk81jk97f.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mg74qm59w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9s161677v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The main objective of this investigation was to study and  improve the precipitation characteristics of Ni(OH)2 in a sulphate system at various  temperatures and pHs.

Among them the Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) is the most  promising. In this thesis, application of the PML to a high-order FE method is  investigated, particularly with respect to its ability to analyze horn  antennas. The anisotropic material properties of the PML can be chosen  such that a plane-wave incident from free space onto the anisotropic material will  have no reflection. The interface of the absorber is made reflectionless by choosing  the appropriate ε and μ values to be complex diagonal tensors. The  performance parameters of this absorber are explored. For the finite element analysis, high-order hierarchal edge  elements are used, and how the element size and order of the basis function affect  the solution accuracy and computational cost are observed. It is possible to achieve  very good absorption for comparatively less computational cost by using relatively  thin absorbing layers along with careful consideration of the relations of the  element size and the order of the basis function. The impedance characteristics and  far field radiation pattern of a horn antenna are computed and compared with  previously-published measured results.</description><creator>Paul, Prakash</creator><contributor>Webb, J.

The  maneuver advantage of the interceptor over the TBM being reduced, a new approach for  estimation and guidance for the interception of a maneuvering TBM is presented in  this research. The target is assumed to use its maneuvering potential by performing  a single evasive bang-bang maneuver. A simple detection algorithm for an evasive  maneuver of the target combined with the use of a multiple model estimators like the  interactive multiple models (IMM) led to a new adaptive guidance law, the DGL/Adapt  law.

The 'prills' were prepared by Magnola Metallurgie Inc. Pictures of the  digestion are presented and two types of bubbling behaviours were  observed. It was concluded that the digestion process occurred in two  steps: (1) dehydration/hydrolysis of prills in the solid state and (2) dissolution  of the dehydrated products. Each step was accompanied by a distinctive bubbling  behaviour as the gas products of the step were evolved. The type of bubbling behaviour associated with the first step  was termed 'Primary Bubbling' and was due to the release of the waters of hydration,  hereinafter termed dehydration. The second type of bubbling behaviour observed was  termed 'Secondary Bubbling' and was due to the decomposition of dissolved oxide in  the molten salt according to the reaction: MgOHCldiss→MgOs+HCl  g The solubility of the dissolved oxide was seen to be a function  of temperature and MgCl2 activity in the melt. Analysis of the gas evolved during  Secondary Bubbling revealed a gas composition of about 51 vol.% HCl and 49 vol.%  H2O, indicating that dissolved oxide was also being chlorinated by the reaction:  MgOHCldiss →MgCl2l+HO g Injection of Ar decomposed the dissolved oxide by offsetting the  first reaction above to the left and injection of HCl chlorinated solid MgO by the  reaction: MgOs+2H Clg→MgCl2l +H2Og Surprisingly, it was found the HCl atmosphere in the freeboard  of the reactor had no significant effect to suppress the hydrolysis reaction  occurring during dehydration.</description><creator>Kreuh, Matthew</creator><contributor>Harris, Ralph (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</subject><title>Dehydration and digestion of Magnola Metallurgic Inc 'Prills' in a molten salt</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ws859g26k.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/td96k3220</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kh04dq270</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Any attempt at extracting information about a three dimensional  scene from an image or image sequence is inherently ill-posed. This is due to the  large amount of information that is lost in projecting a three-dimensional world  onto a two-dimensional sensor. One way to retrieve some of this lost information is  to have many cameras covering overlapping regions of the scene, in the hopes of  retrieving complementary information, which can be combined to form a more accurate  whole. However, as the number of cameras grows, it becomes infeasible to have all  the raw video feeds treated by a central processor. Our solution to this problem is  to have each of the cameras do some local processing, sharing its results rather  than its raw data. This thesis describes the design of an FPGA-based reconfigurable  computing framework for a single node in the camera array. Notions of the network  architecture insofar as it relates to each node are developed, along with the  general framework upon which applications will be built as inter-changeable modules.  The framework is tested by adapting and implementing a person detection algorithm [  16]. Extrapolation from simulation results suggests that the design, when running on  a 100MHz clock, should be able to run at 3 frames per second when a person is in the  scene, and 40 frames per second otherwise.</description><creator>Laprise, Pierre-Olivier</creator><contributor>Clark, James J.

Little work has been done, however, on directly quantifying reagent  adsorption, certainly under industrial process conditions. The use of a novel  surface analysis technique, Headspace Analysis Gas-phase Infrared Spectroscopy  (HAGIS), is suggested for quantification of adsorbed reagents in mineral  processing. As a first exercise, a test system of xanthate adsorption onto  lead sulphide minerals was studied. A survey of possible calibration standards (pure  xanthate, a synthetic lead-xanthate, galena (PbS) and a lead sulphide ore  conditioned with xanthate) resulted in linear curves for all four cases. The  quantification of isopropyl xanthate adsorption onto batch flotation products  (concentrate and tail) was used to determine that ore standards gave the most  accurate results. The technique was also tested for quantification of adsorbed  amines. Two collectors, dodecylamine and diphenylguanidine, and a depressant,  triethylenetetramine, were studied. A common calibration curve was prepared using  diphenylguanidine adsorbed on Inco matte. Results show that the HAGIS technique can  easily be used to quantify adsorbed amines. It is concluded that the HAGIS technique is a powerful new tool  for the quantitative determination of adsorbed reagents. The xanthate study showed  the use of ores as standards produces the best calibration. The amine study  introduced the possibility of analyzing reagent mixtures.</description><creator>Lascelles, Dominique</creator><contributor>Finch, J. A.

Animal models used to investigate these  devices can deliver results for restenosis rates, but cannot provide accurate dose  delivery information which would be very useful for refining stent geometries and  apposition techniques to optimize dose delivery. In this study, a two-dimensional  numerical model is constructed to explore geometrical situations of interest  following stent implantation. Metallic stents with a polymer coating and  biodegradable solid polymeric stents represent two different vehicles for local  delivery. A comparison between these stent types is carried out through the  variation of geometric parameters of interest. An investigation of solid polymeric  stent struts in a curved vessel is then done through a comparison of dose delivery  characteristics on inner and outer walls. Dose delivery success is measured using  three quantities: the dose homogeneity in a defined therapeutic region, the  percentage of mass remaining in that therapeutic region after a defined therapeutic  duration, and the amount of contact between the stent and the vascular wall. The  appropriateness of a quasi-stationary hypothesis is then justified in two dimensions  through analysis of flow and diffusion parameters. This simplification is applied to  stent geometries in three dimensions and a single local delivery effectiveness score  based on the three dose delivery parameters is calculated. This tool for evaluating  stent designs on the basis of local delivery effectiveness provides a starting point  for similar, more sophisticated methods that could eventually be applied to a larger  sample of existing stent geometries. Ultimately, the output of such a tool could be  used to optimize drug-eluting stent designs.</description><creator>Bulman-Fleming, Neil</creator><contributor>Mongrain, Rosaire (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</subject><title>Numerical simulations of stent-based local drug delivery : 2D geometric investigations and the evaluation of 3D designs on the basis of local delivery effectiveness</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/td96k3238.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s7526c923</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):25050</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
