One mechanism by which polyGln-expanded proteins are believed to cause neuronotoxicity is through aberrant interaction(s) with, and possible sequestration of, critical cellular protein(s). Our goal was to confirm and further characterize the interaction between hAR and cytochrome c oxidase subunit Vb (COXVb), a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein. We had previously isolated COXVb as an AR-interacting protein in a yeast two-hybrid search to identify candidates that interact with normal and polyGln-expanded AR. Using the mammalian two-hybrid system, we confirm that COXVb interacts with normal and mutant AR and demonstrate that the COXVb-normal AR interaction is stimulated by heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70). Also, BFP-tagged AR specifically co-localizes with cytoplasmic aggregates formed by GFP-labelled polyGln-expanded AR in androgen-treated cells. Mitochondrial dysfunction may precede neuropathological findings in polyGln-expanded disorders and may thus represent an early event in neuronotoxicity. Interaction of COXVb and hAR, with subsequent sequestration of COXVb, may provide a mechanism for putative mitochondrial dysfunction in SBMA.</description><creator>Beauchemin, Annie.</creator><contributor>Pinsky, Leonard (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Cytochrome oxidase.</subject><subject>Androgens -- Receptors.</subject><subject>Spinal muscular atrophy -- Pathogenesis.</subject><title>Cytochrome c oxidase subunit Vb interacts with human androgen receptor : a potential mechanism for neuronotoxicity in spinobulbar muscular atrophy</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/08612q442.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94hr464</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bc386m190</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:48:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Chaoborus americanus larvae were used in laboratory experiments to assess their efficiency at decreasing mosquito larval populations. Third and fourth instar Chaoborus americanus larvae were independently fed assemblages of single prey species to test hunger and several prey species to test preference. Prey species included Daphnia and the four Aedes aegypti larval instars. The results show that Chaoborus americanus larvae will choose early instar mosquito larvae over Daphnia, however, this preference decreases as the mosquito larvae become older. Third instar Chaoborus americanus larvae will choose first instar mosquito larvae over Daphnia 76% of the time, whereas they will select third instar mosquito larvae only 30% of the time. Fourth instar Chaoborus americanus larvae will choose first instar mosquito larvae 94% of the time, and select fourth instar mosquito larvae only 3% of the time. Crowding also has an effect on feeding times; individual Chaoborus larvae take more time to ingest their prey items than do individuals within a group.

Accretion of supercooled water droplets on precipitating snow (riming) increases the density and fall speed of snow and decreases the intensity of the bright band. For stratiform precipitation with a melting layer, a small peak-to-rain reflectivity difference and a high snow-to-rain velocity ratio indicate high-density snow. A numerical model of the bright band gives a semi-quantitative relationship between snow density and bright band parameters. SCW content is computed theoretically and depends on the gradient of mass flux with height above the melting layer. A large mass flux gradient is an indication of growth by riming.</description><creator>Bell, Candace.</creator><contributor>Zawadzki, Isztar (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</subject><title>Detection of the riming process with a vertically pointing radar</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bv73c2332.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8623j0665</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nc580p27k</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:48:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>First, the set of G-representations of a finitely generated group is described.

As such, this thesis examines choice of law issues in contract and tort in Canada, Louisiana, the Second Restatement on Conflict of Laws 1969, the United Kingdom, the Rome Convention on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations 1980, and Singapore. Using a proposed Model Law on contract and tort choice of law in ASEAN, this thesis will demonstrate that despite differences in the existing choice of law rules, a uniform regime may nevertheless be formulated without significant compromises. On the broader level, this thesis proposes a uniform conflict of laws regime in ASEAN. Using the analogy of contract and tort choice of law, this thesis argues that divergences may be reconciled and a uniform regime forged. It is desired that this thesis will contribute towards the uniformizing of conflict of laws in ASEAN.</description><creator>Lim, Yew Nghee, 1973-</creator><contributor>Tetley, William (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>ASEAN.</subject><subject>Conflict of laws -- Southeast Asia.</subject><subject>Conflict of laws -- Contracts.</subject><subject>Conflict of laws -- Torts.</subject><title>Towards a uniform conflict of laws regime in ASEAN governing international commercial transactions : uniformization of choice of law rules in contract and tort</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/707959504.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2j62s655v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:d791sj075</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:48:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Knowledge is the key to growth and development. Unfortunately, the knowledge gap which exists between industrialized countries and developing ones is large. As information technologies play an essential role in the movement of knowledge and information, they hold promise for the reduction of this gap. Information technologies are being introduced progressively in all activities of both the public and private sectors. Business organizations and commercial activities are thus being profoundly transformed, at varying levels and by different instruments. Developing countries cannot afford to be left behind in this information revolution. The international community recognizes this, and has instituted a range of programmes promoting electronic commerce in developing countries. However, to maximize the benefits, developing countries must put in place an environment that favours and promotes the acquisition, absorption and communication of knowledge by their citizens and business enterprises.</description><creator>Loubier, Christine.</creator><contributor>Glenn, Jane M.

Aerospace power has become the dominant, if not decisive, factor in modern warfare. Yet, there are currently no treaties dealing specifically with the law of armed conflict in the air and space environments. Chapter I describes the evolution to date of the law governing aerospace warfare. Chapter II analyzes the relevance of military interventions in Iraq and Yugoslavia (Bosnia; Kosovo) to the law of air and space warfare. Chapter III discusses the impact of "humanitarian intervention" on the law of aerospace warfare. Chapters IV and V explore the role and effect of earth-based and space-based military assets respectively. This thesis concludes that although the existing law of armed conflict is capable of evolving to cope with the legal issues posed by aerospace warfare in the twenty-first century, the conclusion of multilateral agreements to deal with some of those issues is advisable.</description><creator>Hoversten, Michael R.</creator><contributor>Vlasic, I.

Most countries have increased their economic interdependence. The role delegated to multinational enterprises has been considerably extended. It is suggested that they could become subjects of international law. Their participation in standardisation, eco-labelling and consultation programs increased. They also adopted private codes of conduct and have modernised the way they dialogue with regulatory authorities. One of the impacts of the Uruguay Round Agreements is a subtle reorganisation of forces within national economies. Tremendous responsibilities are progressively undertaken by private entities in domains where the state used to regulate unilaterally. The shift of power from public entities to private ones is discreet but has effects on all traditional sources of law. New forms of regulation on multinational enterprises need to be created.

Experiments were carried out in the standard flammability apparatus of Coward and Jones modified by the insertion of a packed bed of solid monosize spheres in the flame tube. Laminar flames were spark-initiated in quiescent combustible mixtures and failure or successful transmission of the flames through the packed bed was determined by visual observation. The quenching limits were determined as a function of the packed bed parameters (i.e., sphere material, sphere size, length of packed bed, etc.) to elucidate the mechanisms of flame extinction in the bed of spherical particles. The results have direct application to the design of flame arrestors using a packed bed as the flame arresting element. The flame quenching limits are found to be relatively insensitive to the material of the solid spheres, but are dependent on the sphere size through a characteristic length scale that describes the open passages of the packed bed. Flame extinction was always observed to occur within a few millimeters of penetration into the packed bed section indicating that the length of the packed bed has little influence on the quenching of laminar flames. Analysis of the experimental results indicates that the mechanism for flame quenching in a packed bed is governed primarily by heat loss to the sphere surfaces by conduction, convection effects being negligible in the small channels of the packed bed. It is shown that, while conduction is the dominant flame quenching mechanism, selective diffusion and flame stretch also play an important role in the quenching process.</description><creator>Mihalik, Teresa Ann.</creator><contributor>Lee, John H.

They can lower the surface tension of water to below 30 mN/m. They are of interest to industry because of their low toxicity and biodegradability. They find various applications in food and beverages, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries. Rhamnolipids were produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027 using self-cycling fermentation (SCF). The application of this technique led to reproducible but unusual growth patterns. A unique method was adopted to control the SCF. All of the SCF experiments were carried out with a pH control which offers economical advantages for the rhamnolipid production. The production of rhamnolipids using SCF gave a high productivity of 0.23 g/L hr. This value was significantly higher than those obtained for most conventional batch fermentations. A simple and rapid method has been developed to quantify the rhamnolipids being produced using Fourier transformed infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The ratio of the area of the carbonyl peak due to the rhamnolipids to the area of the nitrile peak due to the internal standard (anthracenecarbonitrile) was correlated to the concentration of rhamnolipids in the fermentation broth. Low phosphate was not required for the rhamnolipid production in high yield as reported previously. The proteose-peptone ammonium salts (PPGAS) medium produced a high yield of rhamnolipids because it was a rich medium.</description><creator>Lim, Yin Choy, 1975-</creator><contributor>Cooper, D. G.

The method allows resonant frequencies and corresponding modal damping parameters to be calculated from a limited amount of real time test data. The amount of test time required to obtain the system's frequency response characteristics is reduced by subjecting the structure to an entire range of frequencies within one test pattern, or "sweep", instead of repeating individual tests at a number of different frequencies. The "sweep-rate" is defined as the rate at which the frequency increases or decreases during the frequency sweep. This thesis studies the effect of sweep-rate and sweep-direction on the accuracy of estimated system parameters, as well as assessing two different methods used to reduce discrete time histories to frequency transfer data.

The fiscal analysis software developed for this Master of Engineering and commissioned by the Quebec Ministry of Natural Resources provides the provincial authorities with a quick method of assessing the tax burden of a mining project located in Quebec. It also allows comparison of Quebec's tax burden with that of other Canadian mining provinces as well as the analysis of fiscal changes on a mine's profitability. The use of the software is illustrated by analyzing the effect of inflation and price cycles on the tax burden of a hypothetical mining project located in Quebec. The behavior of specific tax provisions with respect to these factors is emphasized. The report starts with a general review of mineral resource taxation and fiscal instruments available to governments. This is followed by the documentation of mineral taxation in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, three important Canadian mining provinces. The general design and programming of tax analysis software is then described and discussed. The thesis concludes with an analysis of two major economic factors that impact on the tax burden of a mining project, inflation and commodity price cycles.</description><creator>Cuin, Henri Mathieu.</creator><contributor>Bilodeau, Michel (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Political Science, Public Administration.</subject><subject>Business Administration, Accounting.</subject><subject>Engineering, Mining.</subject><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Development of tax analysis software</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d504rn11j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x346d6027</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gm80hx22r</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:48:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The continuing advances in silicon integrated circuit technology in accordance with Moore's Law have fueled the constant performance improvement of computing systems. At the same time, the deployment of networks of workstations with high-speed processors has driven the need to increase bandwidth capacities in networked environments. Electrical interconnect technologies are plagued by substantial physical problems at high frequencies, that limit their data transmission capacities. With increasing clock rates, high-bandwidth computing and communication architectures become more difficult to implement using electrical interconnects, and therefore creates a strong motivation for exploring both free-space and fiber-based optical interconnect technologies. In this thesis, the development of a Fiber Optic Local Area Network (LAN) demonstrator is described. The demonstrator will be used as a testbed for research in high-speed networking technologies, lean protocols, and bandwidth-intensive network-oriented applications, which began at McGill University, Canada, and is being continued at McMaster University, Canada.

Such interconnects utilize two-dimensional smart pixel arrays to take advantage of the additional degree of freedom gained in FSOIs. As a result, thousands of parallel optical channels may be available. In this thesis, I investigate a ring optical broadcast network which is based on polarization fan out by employing the precise polarization state rotations. It presents design techniques, topology and implementation of the network. Simulation, statistical and test results are discussed, which are related to polarization requirement, retardance, and characterization of the PBS. The thesis also shows that the maximum number of stages that can be practically cascended in a fan out network system. The proposed simulations suggest a generalized technique for calculating the accumulated polarization losses of a FSOI implementation by taking into account the polarization states when light is passing through the optical network.</description><creator>Cheng, Fan, 1963-</creator><contributor>Kirk, Andrew (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Demonstration of a free-space optical broadcast network</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/br86b514m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x633f3041</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:t722hb51x</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:48:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Surface relief refractive microlens arrays are designed and fabricated using two methods. In the first method lithographically patterned circular cylinders of photoresist are melted to form the spherical lens shape. In the second method the lens shapes are sculpted lithographically from photoresist using a variable transmission (grey-scale) mask made from high-energy-beam-sensitive (HEBS) glass. The microlenses were characterised interferometrically. It was found that close to diffraction limited performance was achieved in the f/0.9 to f/2 range using the photoresist melting process, whereas diffraction limited performance was achieved using the grey-scale method in the f/1 to f/7 range using aspherical elements. The grey-scale method was also used to fabricate a 64 level computer generated hologram of the logo of the Institut national d'optique (INO) in a single step.</description><creator>Brady, Gregory R.</creator><contributor>Plant, D.

Written questionnaires and interviews were used as tools of inquiry. The students were grade five, majority language students in an early immersion program. Students, parents and teachers were asked about their beliefs on first language reading development, literacy experiences at home as well as at school, second language impact on first language and related topics. Results showed that all students in the study had similar types of literacy experiences at home, regardless of reading ability. By adhering to an Emergent Literacy perspective, parents provided many diverse opportunities for their child(ren) to engage in literacy activities at home. The school had similar views about the importance of literacy practices. Students' literacy experiences at home appear to be in synchrony with their literacy experiences at school. This finding aligns with the aims of a Social Construction of Literacy perspective. Learning to read in a second language did not hinder a child's development of first language reading, although for students having difficulty reading in the first language, the addition of a second language seemed to pose some difficulties for some students. Recommendations are made for future research into family literacy in immersion programs and a follow up study. Research on individual differences among siblings could provide insight into why some children appear to have difficulties reading in their first language while others do not. A follow up study on some or all of the participants would provide continuing data on immersion students' literacy at home and at school.</description><creator>McWhinney, Heather L.</creator><contributor>Maguire, Mary (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Literacy.</subject><subject>Immersion method (Language teaching)</subject><title>Early immersion students' first language literacy at home and at school</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gh93h1379.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4t64gq117</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Second Language Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pg15bg87x</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:48:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Hadji Oemar Said Tjokroaminoto (1882--1934) was one of the leading Indonesian Muslim political figures in the early twentieth century. He was one of the prominent leaders in Sarekat Islam. Beginning in 1912, when he firstly joined Sarekat Islam, Tjokroaminoto devoted alt of his attention to the development of this organization as well as to the political movement in general at that time. This thesis deals with a number of Tjokroaminoto's conceptions of Islam and politics, which reflect his involvement in the political discourses of his time, especially with Communist and secular nationalist groups. His life and his works as well as the political conditions of his time are discussed in order to trace the sources that inspired his vision. In his political ideas, Tjokroaminoto expressed his conceptions of the worth of Indonesian people, socialism and education, as well as the way in which all these ideas are interrelated. His ideas on Islam, which are mainly inspired by his aspiration to create a united Indonesian Muslim community, were highly influential and provided a relatively early definition as to what political Islam should encompass. These ideas are more clearly expressed in his conceptions of the separation between Islam and politics, nationalism, pan-Islamism and the Ummah. Finally, his discussion of Islam and politics marked a new stage in the self-awareness of Indonesians. As such, his ideas were of key importance to the formulation of the movement's goals and its strategies.</description><creator>Melayu, Hasnul Arifin.</creator><contributor>Turgay, A.

Le vent dans les voiles is both a travel fiction and a short apprenticeship novel. Julien Legare, an idealistic young man, is fond of Jim Morrison and Zarathoustra . As he is travelling in Europe, his dreams of intellectual and emotional liberation are breaking down to pieces. Disillusion eventually leads him to a new vision, beyond childhood nostalgia. The essay is a mythocritical analysis of three Twentieth Century novels by Le Clezio, Proust and Gabrielle Roy: Le chercheur d'or, A la recherche du temps perdu and La Route d'Altamont . These books have in common the themes of travel, memory and creation. The three protagonists all long for the lost paradise of their childhood, thus they search for their origins. Travelling in space and time, on the outside and inside themselves, they become archaeologists of their own memory, digging for forgotten treasures.

The study endeavours, first, to analyze the instances of international assistance provided to the TRC to determine what aid worked well and why or why not. The thesis finds overall that foreign support has been an important bulwark to the Commission. Nevertheless, the thesis identifies shortcomings in the effectiveness of foreign assistance to the TRC. Based on these findings the thesis pursues a second objective: extracting lessons from the TRC to guide future international efforts in support of truth commissions in post-conflict and transitional states. The thesis underscores common challenges facing truth commissions. By extrapolating from the South African case the thesis recommends ways international actors can best help future truth commissions overcome these difficulties.</description><creator>McPherson, Duncan M.</creator><contributor>Brynen, Rex (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Reconciliation.</subject><subject>South Africa -- Politics and government -- 1994-</subject><subject>Economic assistance -- South Africa.</subject><subject>South Africa.

While the "querelle du joual" was almost finished, feminists became more and more aware of their so-called "mother tongue"'s inherent sexism. Believing in determinist linguistic theories, the vast majority of them came to the conclusion that language was a symbolic system that rejected women and women's experience. While some American feminists were proposing an important reform of the language, in Quebec, a few women writers incorporated their preoccupations with language in their literary texts. These women dedicated themselves to intensive textual researches, with the intention of creating a new "women's language" that would override the patriarchal law ruling the symbolic order. The different works studied in this thesis have been chosen between those of the women most representative of feminist metalinguistic discourse in Quebec: L'Euguelionne (1976), by Louky Bersianik, L'Amer ou le chapitre effrite (1977), by Nicole Brossard, Une voix pour Odile (1978) by France Theoret and Lueur: roman archeologique (1979) by Madeleine Gagnon. The analysis of these texts will particularly be focused on the tensions building between discursive and formal aspects of each work. We'll see if and how the metalinguistic discourse, which we can find in the texts themselves and in more theoretic articles, is manifesting itself by a radical manipulation of the language at a formal level. The variety of ways some women writers of Quebec tried to inscribe feminine experience in language can be shown as a proof of the extreme difficulty of these textual practices, which elaborate themselves through what they are desperately trying to overcome.</description><creator>Coupal, Sophie.</creator><contributor>Bouchard, Chantal (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>French-Canadian fiction -- Québec (Province) -- History and criticism.</subject><subject>French-Canadian fiction -- 20th century -- History and criticism.</subject><subject>French language -- Sex differences.</subject><subject>Nonsexist language.</subject><subject>Women authors, French-Canadian.</subject><title>Discours métalinguistique et pratiques d'écriture féministes</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qn59q591w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d1768</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:37720f653</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:48:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1.0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Demographic and migration characteristics of riberenos , the largest population group in the Amazon Basin, have been neglected by scholars until recently. This thesis explores the determinants and consequences of migration in the Pacaya-Samina National Reserve (PSNR), northeastern Peruvian Amazon. Our findings suggest that migration reduces the rate of population growth and alters household composition. Logit and probit models show that migration in the area is determined by individual characteristics (i.e., education level of migrants and sibling structure), household factors (i.e., family age-sex composition, kingroup size, age of male head of household, education level of male and female heads of household, illness experience, initial extraction skills, initial non-land assets, and livelihood activity reliance), and community features (land endowments and the presence of a secondary school). Multiple regressions (OLS) further reveal that the household age-sex composition and migration characteristics influence resource use. Migration features seem to be more positively associated with agricultural production and resource extraction, and negatively related with fish production. This research improves our understanding of traditional people in the PSNR area.</description><creator>Chanthabourne, Kittisack.</creator><contributor>Coomes, Oliver T.

Injury rates were assessed by type, position, period, zone, game type, and time loss. Also described are the interactions between injury location and diagnosis, as well as the relationships between time loss, injury location, and diagnosis. This study was based on injury reports provided by the ice hockey staff, which followed a standard injury reporting protocol over the last 17 years. The injury rate of 18.9 injuries per 1000 player hours, third highest among intercollegiate sports, increased slightly over the period covered. The shoulder, face, thigh, and knee were the most injured areas. The number of lacerations decreased, while contusions, sprains, and strains increased, causing the most time loss. Concussions represented the fourth greatest cause of time loss although it accounted for 6.6% of diagnosed injuries. Checking was by far the greatest cause of injury. The examination of the anatomical location-diagnosis interaction revealed that most lacerations affected the face (chin), instability-related injuries (i.e. sprains, strains, and dislocations) involved mostly the knee, groin, and shoulder, respectively. Fractures were localized mostly to the fingers. It seems, therefore, that certain anatomical locations are more susceptible to specific injury types. The fact that the injury rate increased over time may be an indication of the increasing intensity of the game, players' aggressive attitudes and behaviors in response to equipment innovations, or utilization beyond design limitations. Players already have a gladiator-like appearance, and unless we choose to define hockey as a gladiator sport, some important rule, attitude, and equipment design changes will have to be implemented.</description><creator>Yohann, Azuelos.</creator><date>2001</date><subject>Hockey injuries -- Canada.</subject><title>Ice hockey injuries : a 17-year retrospective analysis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128ng45d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5425kc44m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physical Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):38175</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
