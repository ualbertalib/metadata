Cell lines altered in their trafficking pathway were selected using a toxic insulin-diphtheria A-chain molecule (DTaI) which specifically interacts with the insulin receptor. One cell variant (IV-Al-j) which exhibited decreased insulin binding and enhanced insulin degradation did not demonstrate insulin or IGF-1 dependent cell proliferation. IV-Al-j cells also failed to produce an insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylated protein (pp175). IGF-1 binding, insulin-stimulated hexose uptake, epidermal growth factor and thrombin stimulated cell proliferation were unaltered in IV-Al-j cells. These results suggest that the insulin and IGF-1 receptor may share a common pathway post-ligand binding for cell proliferation which does not involve EGF or thrombin, and that enhanced insulin degradation and loss of pp175 may be responsible for the loss of insulin-stimulated cell proliferation.</description><creator>Leckett, Blaine</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>The selection, isolation, and characterization of a Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell line resistant to an insulin-diphteria A-chain toxic conjugate molecule /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r781wg733.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wp988k77t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4j03d057v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:34Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is a smooth muscle relaxant. This thesis examined the effects of ANF on rat uterus. ANF inhibited the motor activity of non-gravid but not of the gravid uterus. This decrease in the tocolytic effects of ANF during pregnancy correlated with an increase in plasma progesterone. The tocolytic activity of ANF was also inhibited by exogenous progesterone. In contrast, the sensitivity of the uterus of both virgin and pregnant rats was significantly increased by the progesterone receptor antagonist, RU486. The inhibition of the tocolytic activity of ANF by ovariectomy was reversed by estrogen. Refractoriness to the tocolytic activity of ANF was accompanied by decreases in myometrial ANF receptors and in the stimulant effects of ANF on myometrial particulate guanylate cyclase activity and cyclic guanosine 3$ sp prime$:5$ sp prime$-monophosphate. In contrast, estrogen and RU486 increased myometrial ANF receptors. It is concluded that the exposure of the myometrium to progesterone during pregnancy results in the down-regulation of myometrial ANF receptors, and in turn in a decrease in its tocolytic and biochemical effects on the uterus; this may be physiologically important for the progression of pregnancy and parturition.</description><creator>Potvin, William</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Health Sciences, Obstetrics and Gynecology.</subject><title>Antagonism of atrial natriuretic factor by progesterone on rat uterus</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vt150k056.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d057v</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2j62s5622</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:35Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is a study of convex parametric programs on regions of stability. The main tools are complete characterizations of optimality without constraint qualifications and a theory of point-to-set mappings. We prove various new results that describe the Lipschitzian behaviour of the optimal value function and optimal solution point-to-set mapping. Then we show how these results can be used in the algorithms of Input Optimization, and other applications. These applications include new results on structural optima in nonlinear programming, determination of optimal trade-off directions in interactive multi-objective optimization, and formulation of new dynamic models for efficiency testing in data envelopment analysis.</description><creator>Van Rooyen, Marchand</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Mathematics.</subject><subject>Statistics.</subject><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Stable parametric optimization</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/js956g70c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2j62s5622</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1c18dg530</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:35Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>To define the viral target sites of cellular permissive factors, simian virus 40-polyomavirus hybrid origins for DNA replication were formed by joining the auxiliary domain of one viral origin to the origin core of the other, and vice versa. The replicative capacity of these constructs were assessed in a number of mouse and monkey cell lines which express the large T antigen of polyomavirus or SV40. The results of this analysis showed that the auxiliary domains of the viral replication origins could substitute for one another in DNA replication, provided that the viral origin core and its cognate large T antigen were present in a permissive cellular milieu. Surprisingly, the large T antigens of the viruses could not substitute for one another, regardless of the species of origin of the host cell, even though the two large T antigens bind to the same sequence motif in vitro. These results suggest that species-specific permissive factors do not interact with the origin auxiliary domains but, rather, with either the origin core, large T antigen, or with both components to effect DNA replication. To determine whether the minimal sequences that constitute a viral enhancer of gene expression are capable of activating DNA replication, a series of recombinant plasmids, composed of elements and subelements (enhansons) of the SV40 enhancer joined to the late border of the polyomavirus origin core domain, were tested for their capacity to replicate in permissive mouse cells synthesizing polyomavirus large T antigen. The results of these experiments demonstrated that a number of reiterated SV40 minimal enhancer sequences are capable of activating polyomavirus DNA replication and that mutations of elements which impair transcriptional activity also disrupt SV40 enhancer-mediated polyomavirus DNA replication. In addition, when the adenovirus E1A gene, a known repressor of gene expression, was examined for its ability to repress the replication of the plasmids described above, it repressed polyomavirus DNA replication in a sequence non-specific manner. To determine whether activation surfaces of eukaryotic transcription factors participate in activation of DNA replication, a reporter plasmid was made bearing the binding site for a yeast transcriptional activator, GAL4, positioned near the late side of the polyomavirus origin core domain, and tested for its ability to replicate in mouse cells expressing polyomavirus large T antigen and GAL4. The results of these experiments demonstrated that binding of GAL4 next to the polyomavirus core led to enhanced replication of the reporter plasmid. This enhanced replication was dependent on a GAL4 binding site and the presence of amino acid sequences required for transcriptional activation in mammalian cells. Moreover, fusion proteins formed between the GAL4 DNA binding domain and activation surfaces of other viral transactivators also activated polyomavirus DNA replication whereas deletion mutants of fusion proteins impaired in their ability to activate transcription were poor activators of DNA replication. Together, these results implicate transcription factors as well as other components of the transcriptional machinery in DNA replication, and suggest that activation of transcription and DNA replication may occur by a common mechanism.</description><creator>Bennett, Ellen R.

In a broad class of such systems, fixed-priority rules, although static, have been shown to be optimal among dynamic schedules. This result however rests on the independence between the order of service and the pattern of arrivals, an assumption which is violated when flow control is exercised. We seek to characterize the optimal scheduling in the presence of flow control, when both scheduling and flow control are optimized jointly. The problem is formulated in a Markovian environment. The cost/benefit structure is such as to penalize delay and reward throughput. It is first shown that the pervasive $ mu c$-rule is not optimal in general, even when flow control is jointly optimal. Restricting the setup to class-independent user-fees and waiting cost-rates, the problem amounts to characterizing the combination of preemptive scheduling and flow control optimizing the tradeoff between delay and throughput in multi-class single server queues. In the special case of two queues, one being saturated, we establish the joint optimality of SEJF (Shortest Expected Job First) scheduling and threshold-type flow control. We conjecture that SEJF remains optimal in the presence of multiple independent Poisson arrival processes, provided that the flow control is simultaneously optimal. The conjecture is supported by an extensive computational investigation which reveals as well that the jointly optimal monotonic flow control is characterized by switching curves that are very nearly linear. From this observation we derive an approximate performance analysis based on a steady-state assumption; the approximation is shown to be very robust and capable of remarkable accuracy. The sensitivity of the performance to the scheduling rule is quantified. The class of window flow controls is observed to be only slightly suboptimal. The conjectured optimality of SEJF is not proved yet. We show that well established methods either fail completely in the present setting or present unexpected difficulties in their application. Experiments with more general models suggest that the optimality of SEJF is insensitive to the exponential assumption for arrival processes, provided that the flow control is jointly optimal. It is also observed that the optimality of SEJF persists at the sink node of a tandem network of two queues with scheduling and flow control at both nodes; again, this optimality of SEJF depends on simultaneously optimal monotonic flow control at each node.</description><creator>De Serres, Yves</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Simultaneous optimization of flow control and scheduling in single-server queues</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nv935382p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/79407z076</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:c821gk669</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:36Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Cis-Pt(NH$ sb3) sb2$Cl$ sb2$ is now well established as an antitumor drug. There are still difficulties in its widespread administration, however, because of its numerous side effects and toxicity. Replacement of the NH$ sb3$ groups by amines more compatible to the human system might possibly be a way of surmounting these problems. One such amine is 1-adamantanamine which has been demonstrated to exibit both antiviral and anticancer activity. New platinum(II) complexes of the type (Pt(A$ sp prime$)Cl$ sb3 rbrack sp-$, Pt(A)(A$ sp prime$)Cl$ sb2$ and Pt(A)(A$ sp prime$)I$ sb2$, where A = methylamine, ethylamine, cyclobutylamine and cyclopentylamine and A$ sp prime$ = 1-adamantanamine, 2-adamantanamine and 1-methyladamantanamine have been synthesized. The structure of (2-adamH) (Pt(EtNH$ sb2$)Cl$ sb3$) complex has been determined by X-ray diffraction. The synthesis of platinum(II) complexes containing the dimethylformamide ligand (DMF) was undertaken to study the reactivity of DMF with chloro-bridged dimers and trimers. When platinum complexes of the type (Pt(A)Cl$ sb3 rbrack sp-$ were stirred in perchloric acid, oligomeric species were formed which can be cleaved by O-donor ligands such as DMF, water or acetone. A series of complexes of the type (Pt(A)Cl$ sb2 rbrack sb{ rm n}$ and (Pt(A)(DMF)Cl$ sb2$), where A = methylamine, ethylamine, cyclobutylamine, cyclopentylamine, dimethylamine and DMF has been synthesized. The crystal structure of a cyclic trimer, cyclo-tri-$ mu$-chloro-tri- (chloro(dimethylamine)platinum(II)) was determined. All the compounds have been characterized by infrared and Raman spectroscopy, by $ sp{195}$Pt- and $ sp1$H-NMR spectroscopy (when soluble) and occasionally by X-ray diffraction when suitable crystals could be obtained.</description><creator>Doyon, Monique</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Chemistry, Pharmaceutical.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</subject><title>Synthesis and characterization of platinum(II) complexes with adamantantanamine derivatives and related ligands</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ws859g50n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c821gk669</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:00000083r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:36Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study examines the relative influence of traditional and biomedical theories of health and disease on the reasoning about childhood nutritional problems by mothers in rural South India. Mothers with different levels of schooling, traditional practitioners, and medical experts were interviewed. Their explanations of nutritional problems were verbally recorded and analysed using methods of cognitive analyses. Nutritional concepts and their interpretations given in the mothers' explanations matched that of the traditional theory of Siddha medicine, prevalent in South India. With an increase in formal education, there was an increase in the use of concepts derived from modern biomedical theory. However, the mothers exhibited little understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved. Implications of these findings for designing nutrition and health education are discussed, in relation to knowledge reorganization to replace harmful concepts and relations with beneficial ones.</description><creator>Sivaramakrishnan, Malathi</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Children -- Nutrition</subject><subject>Children -- India</subject><title>Reasoning about causality and treatment of childhood nutritional deficiencies in rural India : role of indigenous knowledge and practices</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dz010q88z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/00000083r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Curriculum and Instruction</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:b8515p180</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The kinematics and dynamics for the purposes of analysis, control, simulation, and design of general platform-type parallel manipulators are the subject of this thesis. Two new methods of direct kinematics for displacement analysis are proposed. Velocity and acceleration analyses for general kinematic architectures are fully studied. Furthermore, kinematic singularities are classified based on their nature. Architecture singularities and architecture conditioning are deeply studied and incorporated into design strategies, along with design examples. Moreover, formulation singularities are also given due attention with case studies. In dynamics modelling, the method of the natural orthogonal complement is applied such that the resulting models are structurally algorithmic, computationally efficient, and numerically robust--essential properties for the implementation of more sophisticated control strategies. Efficient inverse and direct dynamics algorithms are developed based on the dynamics models in both joint space and Cartesian space. The algorithms have been implemented with a general software package that is available for dynamics control and motion simulation of platform manipulators. As practical applications, the dynamics modelling and simulation of some commercial flight simulators are included. Finally, the concept of dynamic isotropy is introduced, which allows one to evaluate the motion/force performance of a manipulator with respect to control and simulation. Application strategies of this concept to some robotics problems such as design, trajectory planning, and inverse kinematics are discussed, along with examples.</description><creator>Ma, Ou</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Mechanical analysis of parallel manipulators with simulation, design and control applications</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kk91fm322.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b8515p180</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ms35t9341</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The dynamics and control of a catalytic bubbling fluidized-bed reactor were investigated. The reaction chosen was the selective oxidation of benzene to maleic anhydride. This highly exothermic reaction proceeds according to a parallel-consecutive scheme. The study of reaction kinetics showed that the reaction rate expressions based on the oxido-reduction mechanism could be used to describe the benzene conversion and maleic anhydride yield. A fluidized bed reactor model using bubble assemblage concepts combined with the reaction rate expressions gave accurate predictions of the benzene conversion and maleic anhydride yield for a wide range of temperature, feed rate, inlet benzene concentration, and catalyst mass. A phenomenological model of the dynamic behaviour based on the steady-state model was formulated and validated with experimental data. The model predicted accurately the responses of temperature and product concentrations. The study of the reactor steady-state and dynamic behaviour showed that benzene conversion and maleic anhydride production rate could be used as controlled variables to optimize the yield. System identification techniques were used to obtain input-output linear models of the benzene conversion and maleic anhydride production rate as a function of feed rate and temperature set-point. The models were used to design a multivariable controller based on the internal model control approach. The performance of different controller designs was studied through simulation.</description><creator>Perrier, Michel</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Modelling and control of a fluidized-bed reactor</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6m311q11x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ms35t9341</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h989r383c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A series of eight full-scale precast concrete columns and one precast pretensioned wall panel were tested to determine their reversed cyclic loading responses. The specimens represent typical single-storey precast members including the connections to the foundations. This experimental study illustrates the performance of specimens designed using the current design approach recommended by PCI and CPCI. Methods of increasing the stiffness of the connections and improving the levels of ductility are presented. Details consistent with the seismic design provisions of the CSA Standard were investigated and the resulting performance of the columns and the panel are assessed in terms of expected R factors of the National Building Code of Canada (1990). Analytical models are presented to enable the prediction of the reversed cyclic loading responses of the precast column-foundation and wall-foundation subassemblages. These analytical models are compared with the test results and also enabled the assessment of the performance of single-storey precast concrete structures by non-linear dynamic analyses.

As francophones have laid claim to the decision-making spheres of power, anglophones have experienced losses to their community through out-migration and the loss of social power. This study reveals various responses within the church, incorporating concepts of community and 'place' as symbols in identity formation and cultural affirmation. Levels of financial commitment for individual parishes and mission outreach, numbers of Easter communicants and response to liturgical change all show distinctive patterns. The research also points to important implications for the church in relation to its aging population, the role of women, and the significance of family histories.</description><creator>Marshall, Joan, 1943-</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Anglican Church of Canada -- Québec (Province)</subject><subject>Minorities -- Québec (Province)</subject><subject>Québec (Province) -- Ethnic relations</subject><title>The Anglican Church and socio-political change : implications for an English-speaking minority in Quebec</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9z903081w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zc77sq958</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2514nm28r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Amyloidosis is a chronic degenerative disease that is characterized by the deposition of fibrous $ beta$-pleated amyloid proteins in various soft tissues and organs (Glenner 1980, Kisilevsky 1983 &amp; 1987). Sporadic form of Alzheimer's disease is one of the most common forms of systemic amyloidosis, with the current prevalence of approximately 4 million cases in the United States and 6 to 8 million cases worldwide (Kisilevsky 1987, Coleman 1990). Amyloidosis can be experimentally induced in animals. In the inflammation-associated mouse model of amyloidosis, the preamyloid phase, which usually lasts for a number of weeks, is shortened to 24 to 48 hr in the recipient mice upon the administration of amyloid enhancing factor (AEF). AEF activity is present in a much higher level in amyloidotic animals, as well as the amyloidotic tissues in humans (Werdlin and Ranlov 1966, Kisilevsky 1983, Ali-Khan et al. 1988, Alizadeh-Khiavi et al. 1988). Using brain extracts from Alzheimer patients and liver and spleen extracts from our well-characterized alveolar hydatid cyst (AHC)-mouse model of amyloidosis (Ali-Khan et al. 1983b, Alkarmi and Ali-Khan 1984, Abankwa and Ali-Khan 1988a &amp; 1988b, Alizadeh-Khiavi and Ali-Khan 1988, Du and Ali-Khan 1990) I have been able to purify ubiquitin (UB) and demonstrate its AEF activity in mice (Alizadeh-Khiavi and Ali-Khan 1990, Alizadeh-Khiavi et al. 1990a &amp; 1990b). UB, a stress protein universally found in all eukaryotes, can function as a sentinel-like molecule in the degradation of short-lived or abnormal proteins (Rechsteiner 1987). At a level as low as 10 $ mu$g, the tissue derived UB shows potent AEF activity in the mouse bioassay. The fact that recombinant wild type ubiquitin (R-UB) possess AEF activity, that the AEF activity of both crude and R-UB is abolished by anti-ubiquitin antibody, and that the same antibody inhibits the in vitro amyloidogenic activity by ubiquitin-rich macrophages, further establishes the role of ubiquitin in amyloidogenesis. Using immunohistochemistry and immuno-electron microscopy I have confirmed the cell origin of AEF/ubiquitin, localized its presence in the intracellular compartments of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages, and demonstrated its binding to murine AA amyloid.</description><creator>Alizadeh-Khiavi, Kamel</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><title>Amyloid enhancing factor activity is associated with ubiquitin</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kw52j888q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2514nm28r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9z9030825</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The aim of this study is to define a cellular antigen associated with human pancreatic carcinoma by developing monoclonal antibodies against the post-microsomal fraction of fresh tumor tissue. One such antibody, LD-B1, was tested by immunohistochemistry and reacted strongly with 95% of cases of pancreatic ductal carcinomas. Amongst common types of non-pancreatic malignancies, 10% were immunostained by LD-B1 and, in these cases the reaction was focal or weak. On normal pancreas, staining was observed in ductal and ductular epithelium only. The antigen was purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography. Enzymatic and biochemical analysis showed it to be a heavily glycosylated, non-sialylated glycoprotein, that had an apparent molecular weight of 300-400 KDa. Competitive inhibition experiments indicated that it involves an extended epitope of Gal$ beta1 to3$Gal$ beta1 to3$(or 4)GlcNAc$ beta1 to3$ Gal, which is related to blood group H antigen. An ELISA was developed and it showed elevated serum antigen levels were detected in 5 of 6 patients with pancreatic carcinoma, none of 3 patients with chronic pancreatitis, and 12 of 137 normal controls. The results indicate that patients with pancreatic carcinoma exhibit altered expression of a blood group-related antigen that can be used as a marker of pancreatic carcinoma.</description><creator>Halwani, Fawaz</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><title>Isolation and partial characterization of a human pancreatic carcinoma-associated antigen defined by a novel monoclonal antibody, LD-B1</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8910jv483.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z9030825</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pathology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:08612p44v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation seeks to identify teachers' perspectives and practices which play a role in the literacy process. The qualitative method was used in the examination of four first-grade classes in a school serving a slum population in Porto Alegre, Brazil. The concepts "classification" and "frame" of educational knowledge (Bernstein, 1975), the "process of social stratification" in the classroom (Sharp and Green, 1975), and the "we-they-relationships" (Schutz, 1971) are used in the analysis. Participant and non-participant observations demonstrated the presence of political, economic extra-school factors which interfered with effective teaching. Nevertheless, pupils with a long career in the first grade as well as first-time students became literate during 180 school days. Factors influencing the success of literacy teaching were: (a) the teachers' competence; (b) their belief in education as essential to the improvement of the standard of living of slum-dwellers; (c) the establishment of a "we-relationship" where the teachers assume responsibility for the learning of each pupil and reject the rigid categorization of scholastic failure.</description><creator>Veit,

In one of two experiments, a propagating interaction was initiated, by an exploding wire trigger, in a channel formed by two sections of 1.25 cm and 5 cm in width. The interaction failed consistently at the transition into the larger channel, due to the sudden lateral expansion. The behavior of the interaction was also investigated in the absence of confining walls, accomplished by triggering it in the center of a cylindrical tank. The system's response to the trigger varied erratically. Successfully triggered interactions travelled radially outward, about 5-11 cm from the center, at 30-60 m/s, producing overpressures of 0.15 to 0.5 MPa. The tin debris analysis indicated that only a thin layer of tin, ${ sim.86}$ mm deep, was involved in the interaction. This event is, however, suspected to be the result of an overdriven interaction, rather than a sustained propagation. The inherent difficulty in initiating a propagating interaction in the cylindrical geometry lies in the effect of the divergence of the flow. The energy yield/surface area of the event is of the same order of magnitude as that of single tin drop/water explosions and stratified tin/water interactions in a narrow channel, suggesting that the energetics are not significantly influenced by the geometry. This interaction, in many cases, served as a "precursor" event for a second, more energetic interaction, initiated in the coarse mixture of water and molten tin fragments lofted in the wake of the first interaction.

This thesis explores further compression of test data through the grouping of closely related vectors into clusters and extracting both common information, in a form compatible with the reseeding method, and individual information for the component vectors. Two greedy algorithms for finding these clusters are described, the first trying to form the largest groupings while the second trying to make the most advantageous mergers at each step. In addition, several schemes of storing and decoding the information needed for individual vectors are presented, some of which use memories in the form of stacks or caches to take advantage of the distribution of this data. Aside from the LFSR, some counters and the memory, little additional hardware is required. The solutions offer a range of trade-offs between test length, hardware complexity and test data storage. Results are given for experiments carried out on ISCAS-89 benchmark circuits and on a set of industrial circuits contrasting the performances of the algorithms and the requirements of the different methods of storage. Considerable improvements over reseeding are demonstrated, more so for the industrial circuits which are inherently hard to test.</description><creator>Alleyne, Ronald</creator><contributor>Rajski, J.

The absorption column was 7.5 cm in diameter and 150 cm in height and packed randomly with 6 mm Intalox Saddles. It was designed to remove hydrogen sulfide from a gas mixture of 1.5% hydrogen sulfide and 15% carbon dioxide at an efficiency of 95%. Reliability of the experimental setup has been perused by investigating the residence time distribution of the gas phase in the column and by studying the absorption of carbon dioxide in water. In the first part of the experimental work, it was found that carbonate concentration has a major effect on the absorption of hydrogen sulfide, while the absorption of carbon dioxide is affected significantly by temperature. In the second part of the experimental work, the influence of all parameters on the absorption of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide has been investigated. Results were analyzed in terms of removal efficiencies, the overall mass transfer coefficients and the selectivity of the process for hydrogen sulfide. It was observed that hydrogen sulfide can be absorbed selectively in the presence of carbon dioxide at low operating temperatures, high carbonate concentration and high gas to liquid ratios. A removal efficiency of hydrogen sulfide of about 92% accompanied with about 17% of initial amount of carbon dioxide has been achieved.

For any practical impregnation device, the impregnation is affected by factors such as: the pressure of the resin that comes in contact with the fibers, the time this pressure is applied (contact time) and the length of the pressure zone. Most continuous impregnation devices for fiber rovings involve the principle of dynamic viscous pressurization in a wedge-type geometry. As an initial step towards the development of a novel impregnation process, a special device was designed to drag an impermeable tape and an accompanying fluid between two symmetric stationary surfaces. The pressure development in the gap was investigated theoretically and experimentally as a function of various geometric and operating parameters. For the Newtonian fluids used in the exploratory experiments, good agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results was found for the maximum pressure. The downstream pressure drop was found to be slower than predicted, a finding which would be helpful in the case of fiber impregnation.</description><creator>Alecu, Constanta Adelina</creator><contributor>Charrier, J.-M.

Here, the profile of Ub is examined in activated leukocytes and splenic reticulo-endothelial (RE) cells and its relationship with serum amyloid A protein (SAA) and AA amyloid (AA) deposits in an alveolar hydatid cyst (AHC)-infected mouse model of AA amyloidosis. In response to AHC infection, the diffuse Ub immunoreactivity in normal mouse leukocytes and RE cells promptly changed to a discrete granular pattern suggesting an increase in the intracellular concentration of Ub and the formation of Ub-protein conjugates. This corresponded to elevation in SAA levels, SAA uptake by Ub-positive phagocytic cells, co-localization of Ub and SAA in the RE, cells and deposition of Ub-bound AA amyploid in the splenic and hepatic tissues. Ultrastructural immunogold studies have revealed SAA/AA and Ub enrichment in endosome-lysosomes (EL) in activated monocytoid cells, thus implicating EL in AA formation. Aspects of AA amyloidogenesis are discussed in relation to other experimental models in which stress-induced Ub-protein conjugate formation and its transport to lysosomal (EL) vesicles have been studied. Whether plasma membrane bound or EL enzymes from activated murine splenic/hepatic RE cells degrade SAA$ sb2$ to generate amyloidogenic AA-like peptides is not clearly understood. These results suggest that Ub (or AEF)-loaded monocytoid cells may play an important role in the physiological processing of the sequestered SAA into AA amyloid.</description><creator>Chronopoulos, Soula</creator><contributor>Ali-Khan, Z.

I have compared the expression of various genes, using the slot-blot technique, in two different systems. First, the level of expression of a wide variety of genes was analyzed in the hypertrophied heart of transgenic mice expressing the polyomavirus large T-antigen gene, and compared to normal control heart. I have shown that most changes in gene expression occurred mainly during early stages of heart hypertrophy. These genes code for proteins known to play a role in signal transduction, and transcriptional and growth control. The latter stages of cardiac hypertrophy are accompanied by changes in the expression of genes that are mostly involved in stress responses. Second, we analyzed the expression of various genes in three mouse myogenic cell lines undergoing differentiation in several culture conditions. The adult (C2C12) and fetal-derived (G7 and G8) myoblast cell lines were exposed to either retinoic acid, dimethyl sulfoxide, or transforming growth factor $ beta$. These three molecules are known to have profound effects on cellular growth and differentiation. I have shown that these treatments result in significant changes in expression of a wide variety of genes. Interestingly, all three cell lines differed considerably in their pattern of gene expression. Results from the analysis of these two systems demonstrate that differentially induced morphological changes of muscle cells, result in cell type specific changes in expression of a variety of genes.</description><creator>Holder, Emma L.
