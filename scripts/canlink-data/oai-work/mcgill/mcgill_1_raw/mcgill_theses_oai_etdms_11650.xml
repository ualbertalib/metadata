The remaining 10 stars could, on the basis of energy and momentum criteria, be attributed to either of the above disintegration processes but the balance of evidence is in favour of the 0^16 (n, α) 0^13 reaction. Further evidence for the O^16 (n, nα) O^12 reaction was found in the coincidence of energy levels in O^16 calculated on the basis of this reaction with known energy levels. Evidence was also obtained for the existence of the proposed 9.8 Mev. level in oxygen.

Over a century ago, histologists and cytologists were already puzzled by the structure of this tissue. Some of the best histological works of the 1890’s were done in unraveling the complexity of this epithelium. In fact, some of the descriptions given by the workers of this time have remained classical until now. Recently, with the advent of histochemical techniques and of the electron microscope, there has been a renewed interest in the study of the seminiferous epithelium. Several important problems had indeed remained unsolved. Some of them were histological, e.g. the arrangement of the various types of cells present in the epithelium, that is spermatogonia, spermatocytes and spermatids, in a series of different combinations. Others were cytological, e.g. the complex series of changes taking place during the transformation of a spermatid into a spermatozoon. others, finally, were endocrinological, e.g. the relationship between the male hormone-secreting Leydig cell and the production of Spermatozoa by the seminiferous epithelium. The first two of these problems will be examined systematically in the present study. [...]</description><creator>Clermont, Yves W.</creator><contributor>Leblond, C.

The field strength at any point is measured by the work required to move a unit charge to this point against the repulsion of the field. The field strength, or potential gradient, is commonly expressed in volts/cm. and the potential difference across the field is measured in volts. Capacity is defined by the equation QrCE where Q, is the quantity of the charge in coulombs, E is the field potential in volts and C is the capacity in farads.

Indeed nothing has heretofore been published about the bacteria and yeasts that are indigenous to Canadian apples. Research about the microflora of fruit has been directed, for the most part, toward establishing the effects of preservatives on the keeping quality of fruit and fruit products. Few studies have been made, however, to determine the types and respective numbers of microorganisms initially present on fruit. There seems to be little doubt that the amount of preservative and the type of preservation used for fruit and fruit products depend to a great extent on the types of organisms initially present. For instance, the keeping quality of apple juice before it is bottled depends largely upon the initial contamination of the fruit with spoilage microorganisms [...] The present study was undertaken to isolate and classify a number of the most predominant yeasts occurring on apples grown at two widely separated places in Quebec. The study also included an investigation of the yeasts found in apple cider that was fermented and allowed to mature under natural conditions for one year, and the rate and factors affecting the rate of alcohol production by fermenting yeasts.</description><creator>Clark, Davis Sedgefield.</creator><contributor>Wallace, R.

E. tenella is transmitted from host to host in the form of a resistant oocyst, which, under suitable conditions of environmental temperature and humidity, undergoes internal division, resulting in four sporocysts each containing two eporozoites. These sporulated oocysts are Infective to a new host and are swallowed with the food as a contamination. The sporozoltes are liberated in the intestine of the bird and develop in the caeca, where a number of asexual generations occur successively. This asexual multiplication consists of invasion of the epithelial cells, development into a large schlzont, segmentation into a large number of crescenWshaped merozoites, and a repetition of this process for an Indefinite number of times. This continual invasion and increasing tissue damage results in the passage of large amounts of blood from the bowel.[...]</description><creator>Frank, Julius.</creator><contributor>Cameron, T.

They have, due to their migratory and prolific breeding habits, invaded and colonised all lands throughout practically the entire world. However, financial losses occasioned by these rats is relatively insignificant when the risk of disease due to their presence is considered. Plague, Rat-bite Fever, Spirochaetal Diseases, Equine Influenza, Foot-and-mouth Disease, together with various helminths and perhaps Entamoeba histolytica, are all known to be disseminated by rats. With regard to the helminths, it may act as an intermediate host for cestodes of the genus Taenia, and as a direct or indirect spreader of cestodes and nematodes; indirect infection is accomplished when the helminth has, as intermediate host, some arthropod as in the case of certain cestodes and nematodes, or some mollusc such as in the trematodes.

Preliminary exploration revealed a number of gold-bearing shear zones and irregular gold-quartz veins. From some of the latter a total of 647 ounces of gold were produced prior to 1941. In that year control of the Company was acquired by Frobisher Exploration Company, whose geologist, A.S.Dadson, advanced the suggestion that the valley of Baker Creek which crosses the claims, was underlain by a major shear zone that might be gold-bearing. Diamond drilling verified this hypothesis and ore-shoots totalling 6,390 feet have thus far been indicated within a total distance of 11,800 feet. The East zone forms one of the ore-bearing zones (Figure 2).</description><creator>Kirkland, Robert Walter.</creator><contributor>Jolliffe, A.

A modified type of oxygen consumption apparatus was described* Observations were made on the weight, oxygen consumption, feed and water intake and respiration rate of the animals during pregnancy and lactation. The outcome of pregnancy, post mortem findings and histological changes in both the mother and offspring were noted, as well as the birth weight and gains of the young. Thiouracil (40 mg./day) was without effect on the guinea pigs. The two levels of protamone used (800 ug. and 1600 ug./day) had an equal effect. Although protamone brought about an increase in oxygen consumption per unit of body weight and a decrease in rate of gain of adult female guinea pigs, no detrimental effect on either the mother or the young was observed.</description><creator>Farmer, Florence Amelia.</creator><contributor>Crampton, E.

The study includes investigation of a wide variety of blood components, data for which were previously available only as isolated findings. It has been shown that there is a close relationship between the peripheral venous oxygen saturation and the clinical condition of the patient. The use of observations on the character of the peripheral veins as a criterion in the clinical assessment of casualties, has been demonstrated to have a metabolic basis. The crucial condition of peripheral oxygen supply in desperately wounded cases has been established, and with it the reasons why blood may be of greater value than plasma in the resuscitation of these casualties. The metabolic disturbances of abdominal casualties have been found to be essentially the same as those of extremity cases. It has been shown that adequate transfusion is essential for correction of the metabolic disturbances in both extremity and abdominal cases.</description><creator>Lathe, Grant H.</creator><contributor>Hoff, H.

The general body plan, polyp and medusa alike, consists of an outer epidermis and an inner gastrodermis, separated from each other by a thin non-cellular mesolamella. The epidermis is derived from the embryonic ectoderm,while the gastrodermis is formed of the endoderm. Whether the sexual products originate from any particular layer, or whether there exists a sexual polarity between the two layers, has long attracted the attention of zoologists since the enunciation of von Baer’s germ-layer theory.

Present indications are that this shortage is likely to continue, in view of an expanding livestock industry, increased consciousness of the importance of proteins on the part of feeders, and the world food situation in general. Consequently, a widespread search is being conducted for new materials to serve in this capacity, and information on their efficiency as protein supplements is important with a view to recommending their most efficient use. The most acute shortage has occurred in the case of proteins of animal and marine origin. Among the factors contributing to this situation have been government encouragement of the production of swine for export, transportation problems involved in moving fish meal from the seaboards, and increased poultry production due to a shortage of beef. In the past, animal and marine protein concentrates have been highly regarded as supplements in livestock rations, and considerable evidence was accumulated indicating their superiority over concentrates of vegetable origin. Recently, however, this evience has been questioned and it is suggested that the superiority of animal proteins may be due in part to the fact that they contain liberal amounts of minerals and vitamins in which vegetable proteins are usually deficient.[...]</description><creator>Aitken, Johnstone Reaper.</creator><contributor>Crampton, E.

During the war years works had been erected in western Canada for the production of large quantities of ammonia, and it was desirable that a peacetime use for this chemicalbe found. Furthennore there are large supplies of sodiumsulphate in the Canadian west. The world-wide success ofthe ammonia-soda process applied to sodium chloride led to the inquiry as to whether the same process could be applied to sodium sulphate. Preliminary investigation indicated that the formation of sodium bicarbonate would present no difficulty, and that the chief problem would be in recovering ammonia from the ammonium sulphate formed, or in finding some method of removing It from the solutions. It was while considering this problem that the author was led to conceive of ammonia as a precipitating agent for ammonium sulphate. The object of this brief investigation was merely to establish the principles involved and to outline in a general way the proposed process.[...]</description><creator>Downes, Kenneth William.</creator><contributor>Winkler, C.
