The predominance of this crop has led to great interest being taken in measures by which a potential yield can be attained. The potential yield, according to Dillewijn (1952, p. xxii), is the maximum yield attainable given that the following five factors are fully satisfied: solar energy (heat and light), moisture (rainfall and irrigation), soil condition, availability of labour, and cultural methods. The potential yield, he states, is only of theoretical importance because the sugar industry is an economic enterprise, concerned with economic yield, which is generally lower than the potential yield.

One technique uses the output from a system scanning the map to deflect the trace on the cathoderay tube of an oscilloscope in discrete steps depending on the intensity of the precipitation. This trace is photographed. Since the brightness of the trace is constant, exposure is a function of scan-time. Because scan-time is proportional to area scanned, the density on film resulting from this exposure is a function of area. Densitometry then yields these areas. A more convenient technique makes use of the fact that scan-time is proportional to the number of cycles of the a.c. output from the scanner, and areal summation is accomplished with an electronic counter. Examples of measurements are presented, and their meteorological value is discussed. [...]</description><creator>Nitka, Gerhard.</creator><contributor>Wein, M. </contributor><contributor>Marshall, J.

Optical studies of undulatory quartz with a two-axis goniometer showed that they have a larger range of undulatory extinction with a large standard deviation. The undulatory range is proportional to the stress and to the sample size. Tne undulatory extinction in quartz is due to misorientation of the crystallites in the crystal. From x-ray precession photographs it was observed that undulatory quartz produces diffuse spots elongated along the Debye-Scherrer rings. The size of the spots increases linearly with increasing radius of the Debye-Scherrer ring. When the elongation of the spots on a-axis and c-axis precession photographs were compared, spots in the c-precession photograph were more elongated. Therefore, it was concluded that there are more dislocations along a-axis in the sample. Non-symmetrical density distribution of an x-ray topography of a spot was observed.

Routine chemical analyses tell nothing of the way the xanthate groups are distributed along the cellulose molecule, or among the three different kinds of hydroxyl groups in the glucose residues. Information of this kind is needed before the process of "ripening" of viscose can be understood in detail, or the physical properties of rayon or cellophane correlated with those of the viscose from which they are derived. Owing to the instability of cellulose sodium xanthate, most of the chemical methods of carbohydrate chemistry are inadmissible. Hence the sodium xanthate is converted to a more stable ester. If then all the remaining free hydroxyl groups are "blocked" and xanthate ester groups are subsequently removed, the regenerated hydroxyl groups are attached to carbon atoms Which were previously substituted with xanthate groups. Attempts by numerous workers to remove all of the xanthate sulfur from fully substituted starch or cellulose xanthate esters consistently failed to remove a small percentage. Moreover, dexanthation was invariably accompanied by removal of a small percentage of the other "blocking" substituents.

Also included are the results of preliminary testing and calibration carried out on the combustion driver section, the shock tube, and the complete tunnel. The loading system by which the driver gases are metered into the combustion chamber is described, as well as the electrical system used to ignite the mixture. A description of the ionization gages used to measure incident shock velocity, along with the piezo-electric pressure transducers for measuring pressure behind the incident and reflected shocks in the tube, and the stagnation pressure in the test section is also given. The high pressure resulting from the combustion of a stoichiometric mixture of oxygen and hydrogen, diluted with 76 or 80% helium, is used to break a steel diaphragm and compress the test gas by a reflected shock process. Combustion tests produced peak pressures approximately 25% below those predicted by constant volume combustion theory. In the shock tube, incident shock Mach numbers up to 6.69 were produced in air at a pressure of one atmosphere, giving rise to pressures behind the reflected shock of up to 6,500 psi. However, due to attenuation in the tube, these values were about 30% below the results expected from theoretical considerations based on no losses.

This is a significant development in the theory of solid-state physics, since many of the problems met with are inherently many-body problems until simplified with the aid of idealized models. One is therefore interested in the result of calculations of the influence of the electron interaction on the various one-electron properties, such as the specifie heat, spin susceptibility, transport properties, etc. The methods employed in developing the theory have ranged from simple classical approximations to full quantum mechanical treatments. The original method of quantum treatment, such as that by Bohm and Pines was based on a transformation of the many-particle Hamiltonian, by a series of canonical transformations, into a form in which the collective motion of the electrons is separated from the individual particle motion. This approach, with the consequent screening of the long range Coulomb interaction, explained the success of the single-particle theory of solids. This method was soon superseded by more elegant treatments of the many-body problem, based upon field theory techniques and perturbation expansions.

The OPE and OBE Models both are one particle exchange theories. Trying to extend the former, using its production vertex technique, leads to divergent integrals. However, using in part the perturbation methods of the OBE model, a finite two pion exchange term is realized. It is found, contrary to the assumption made in the OBE model, that the two pion term gives a contribution greater than the one pion term. (In calculating the two pion term the Ï-Ï interaction in the crossed channel is neglected. This has been taken into account in the OBE model by the exchange of multipion resonances considered as particles in the usual sense.) This result invalidates the claim that the OBE model completely accounts for the dominant contributions to the production process under consideration here. In the light of this fact it is suggested that the fundamental tenets of the OBE model be subjected to critical scrutiny. Further, because of the close relationship between the OPE model and the one pion term of the OBE model, it is inferred that the former is also in need of reevaluation.

For recreational groups, however, this approach is found to be inadequate. The usefulness of the term 'leadership' is questioned and a need is expressed for concepts treating the effect of shared experiences on long-term structural changes. By treating leadership as a collective phenomenon - the 'power structure' - and shared experiences as 'group tradition', one can analyze the behaviour of a recreational group over an extended period. Several quite distinct stages of development can be isolated, ranging from a founding period to an atomization period, and the concepts of power structure and tradition are used to explain the passage from one stage to another. The role of small group development in the integration of minority groups to a host society is also considered.

The antibodies produced to pathogenic antigens serve as a specific defense against these antigens, and the immunized host, if reexposed to the same pathogens resists their harmful effects (1). In contrast to immunity, some animals and humans develop hypersensitivity to either a toxic or innocuous antigen: i.e., following the initial formation of antibodies to an antigen, the host reacts in an abnormal manner if reexposed to the same substance (1). The well known condition of hay fever represents just such a hypersensitivity reaction to the pollens of trees, grasses and weeds. Of the pollen sensitivities occurring on the North American continent, that caused by ragweed is the most prevalent. The present study forms a continuation of investigations made in this laboratory on the chemical nature of constituents of ragweed pollen involved in eliciting ragweed hypersensitivity. A brief survey of work done in this and other laboratories on the isolation and characterization of these constituents is presented in Sections C and D of this chapter. It is appropriate to preface this survey with a discussion of immune and hypersensitive reactions (Section A) and of hypersensitivity to ragweed pollen (Section B).

This condition results when a subject "looks at" a stationary target with his eyes still, and the subject is then said to be fixating the target. The maintenance of visual fixation is relatively easy when both the target and the head are stationary in space. But with the introduction of target and head movement the problem of fixation becomes much more difficult and the requirement can only be met by close integration of several different physiological mechanisms. These are first the elaborate processes jointly referred to as body postural control, second the various patterns of neck reflexes controlling movement of the head on the shoulders, and thirdly vestibular and optokinetic reflexes controlling the angle of the eye in the head.

This is no doubt due to the fact that it has been of little economic importance in Europe or North America. However, its potential as a laboratory test animal has been pointed out by several authors (Stone, 1953; Ghouri and McFarlane, 1958; Ritchot, 1960 ). Several factors enhance its utility - it is easily reared; it is a large enough insect in all stages of its life history to require no special handling, techniques; it has a sufficiently short life history; and finally it is not commonly subject to diseases or parasites in the laboratory.</description><creator>Meikle, John E.

The effect of a virus infection on the host cells has been studied from many aspects. One aspect is the alteration of the protein synthetic capacities of the infected cells. Many studies have been performed on the proteins of the virus particle such as the antigens and the haemagglutinins, or the proteins of the cells, such as the enzymes used to synthesize the virus particles. Little attention has been paid to the cellular proteins which were not involved in the synthesis of the virus particle. Such a protein is antibody. The following report shows how the metbod was establisbed for the quantitation of antibody produced in vitro. It will examine the effect of Newcastle disease virus on the immunologically competent cells in spleen cell suspensions. [...]</description><creator>Medzon, Edward L.</creator><contributor>Reed, R.

The hailswath of the July 14 major storm featured very large hail in two small areas, and regions of rain-but-no-hail embedded within the swath. The largest hail was related to several small and intense radar echoes, during the first 22 minutes of their existence. Data indicate that Alberta hailstorms appear more or less continuous when studied on a coarse scale; however, when data are available on a finer scale, intermittency becomes evident, which points to the conclusion that hailstorms are composed of a number of small, individual, hail-producing cells acting together within storms.

A number of marine bacteria have been reported to have a specifie Na+ requirement for growth and for optimal metabolism. The function of the ions has been considered to be more than a simple osmotic effect, since evidence has been obtained, indicating that inorganic ions play a major part in the maintenance of the integrity of the cell wall. It has also been shown, recently, that Naâº is involved in the penetration of substrates into cells of marine bacteria. Since marine bacteria appear to have special requirements for inorganic ions for growth, transport and the maintenance of cell wall integrity, the knowledge of intracellular ion concentrations are of particular importance to an understanding of the relation of marine bacterial cells to their environment. Only one marine bacterium has so far been examined in any detail in this connection. The aim of this investigation has been to study ion distributions and the conditions affecting ion uptake in three other marine bacterial species. In this study the actual intracellular Naâº, Kâº and Clâ» concentrations have been determined directly and the penetration and the exchange of NaÂ²Â² isotope into the cells has been measured.
