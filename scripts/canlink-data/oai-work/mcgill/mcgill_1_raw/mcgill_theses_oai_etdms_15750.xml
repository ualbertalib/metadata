Spallation is a phenomenon in which nucleons or clusters of nucleons are chipped off from the target nucleus. When a division of the target nucleus into two or more roughly comparable masses occurs, it is called a fission reaction. A study of the spallation or fission reactions helps in understanding the mechanisms which guide a nuclear reaction process. The present study is concerned with the nuclear reactions of tantalum with protons in the energy range 10-90 Mev. In this energy region, it is understood that a predominant compound nucleus mechanism (1) at low energies gradually merges into a Serber mechanism (2) at high energies.</description><creator>Chervu, Lakshman.

Studies in which treatments with ultraviolet irradiation and X-ray irradiation have been compared for the production of translocations have shown that ultraviolet irradiation produces fewer translocations than x-ray irradiation (Stadler and Sprague 1937; Stadler 1941; Emmerling 1955). In the micro-organism Aspergillus nidulans, a high frequency of chromosomal rearrangements (translocations) was round to be induced by gamma-irradiation (Tector 1961).</description><creator>Chen, Andrew.

The aim of this work is to find out the conditions under which the best ENDOR signal can be obtained. A reflection cavity was used for all the results described, since the original transmission cavity developed faults. The samples used were crystals of magnesium oxide containing small amounts of cobalt impurity, present as Co++ ions. Co++ ions in MgO are known to be in surroundings of accurately cubic symmetry. Samples of 5%, 2% and 0.5% nominal concentrations were used and for each concentration, conditions for the best ENDOR signal were found and arereported. The basic spectrometer is similar in principle to that used by Feher15 for electron paramagnetic resonance measurements except that the necessary additional equipment was added for double resonance. The dependence of ENDOR signal on amount or F.M., A.M. and v2- voltage was linear, as expected, with however evidence of departures from linearity in the case of the v2-graph. The variation of ENDOR signal with microwave power showed a fairly sharp maximum, at a power dependent on the concentration of Co++ ions in the sample. A simple theory predicts a maximum when the spin temperature is doubled, and has supported by the results. F.M. was found to be preferable to A.M. for the samples used.</description><creator>Channappa, Kukkuwada. H.</creator><contributor>Fry, D.

For this reason the preparation of ethers and esters of hydroxyfurans presents special problems. As part of a search for general routes to these compounds, Baramki (1) studied the reactions of arylithiums, including d-furyllithiums, with dialkyl peroxides as a means of forming ethers, and Samad (2) studied reactions of diaroyl peroxides which resulted in the introduction of aroyloxy groups into aromatic nuclei. In Part I of this thesis are described experiments designed to complete various aspects of the work initiated by Baramki and Samad.</description><creator>Chang, Hang-Shing.</creator><contributor>Edward, J.

This extension is due to the fact that the nature of the quadrupole effects and their methods of observation are in general parallel to those of NMR (Dehmelt 1954). The existence of nuclear quadrupole energy levels in crystals is associated with interaction between the quadrupole moment of a given nucleus and its inhomogeneous electric field. When an external magnetic field is applied to the crystals, it is, in principle, possible to observe the splitting of absorption lines due to quadrupole interaction in NMR.</description><creator>Chan, Kam.

A dual method of impedance or admittance analysis with the Nyquist criterion is introduced. The Nyquist criterion is used to derive a new and original stability criterion for any one-port reflection amplifier. Methods of measuring the tunnel diode immittance in the amplifier frequency range are presented and discussed. The tunnel diode immittance is measured for various bias values and signal levels. The shunt tuned amplifier is analysed and investigated experimentally for 7 design variations. A new series tuned amplifier using a quarter wave length matching transformer is, introduced. This design is analysed theoretically and verified experimentally. The theoretical results indicate the possibility of realizing, by further design, very high gain-bandwidth products. Two variable gain-bandwidth circuits are investigated, one of which is an original circuit using two diodes in series push-pull. Both circuits are treated theoretically and then verified experimentally for stability and adjustment range.</description><creator>Cardinal, René. E.</creator><contributor>Adler, E.

It was then considered the duty of every young girl to marry. A working-class girl through economic necessity had her living to earn, and therefore, followed a trade, or entered a factory until she married. A middle-class girl had, however, no “work" as such to do, and spent her early years learning to appear in the drawing room as an accomplished and well-bred lady.

The measurements were made at liquid nitrogen and liquid helium temperatures. The material was in the form of wire of diameter .0025 inch. For comparison purposes commercial grade copper magnet wire, #40 gauge, was also tested. The copper showed a relative increase in resistivity deltap/p of 2.5 at 10 Vs/m^2. Corresponding figures for the zirconium and chromium alloys were up to 1.0 and up to .065 respectively. This wide variation in magnetoresistance is shown to be mainly due to the difference in residual resistance, by Kohler’s Rule. The maximum resistance ratios obtained were 100 for copper, 70 for Zr-Cu, and 30 for Cr-Cu. When the results are plotted on Kohler diagrams, the zirconium alloy shows transverse magnetoresistance from 25% to 80% higher than copper. The chromium alloy varied from 20% less to 30% higher than copper.</description><creator>Bolton, Richard. A.</creator><contributor>Stevenson, D.

It is of particular importance in the pulp and paper industry where pulp is transported through conduits in exceedingly large quantities. It also involves fundamental aspects of fluid mechanics which are concerned with such diverse phenomena as the movement of silt in rivers and estuaries and the shifting of sand dunes, and with an increasing number of important commercial applications such as pipeline transport of coal, gilsonite, pulpwood and mineral ores. More recently, two-phase systems have been involved in such sophisticated developments as the operation of nuclear reactors and complex chemical reactions in conveyed systems.</description><creator>Bobkowicz, Andrew.

Early in this work it was found that on exposure to radiation the chains of some polymers were joined while the chains of others were broken. The reactions producing these changes are still not completely understood. Surprisingly little study has been devoted to the effect of radiation on the copolymer of butadiene and styrene which is the basic constituent of the synthetic rubber GR-S.

Wolfe’s work is centered in a single protagonist; a figure that is largely autobiographical, and is dominated by a number of themes. In ‘Look Homeward’, ‘Angel’, the important themes are, the isolation of individuals and their inability to communicate with each other, the influence of chance in men's lives, and the effects of the passing of time. ‘Of Time and The River’ continues these ideas, but the dominant themes are those of Eugene's search for an external and permanent image of strength and wisdom, his Faustian hunger for knowledge, and the problems that beset him as an American artist.</description><creator>Blachford, Janet.

The tissue reaction may vary in severity, but it is believed that it varies little in character, whatever the agent causing the injury may be. For this reason acute pancreatitis is often defined as an acute inflammatory response of the pancreas to injury. In 1842 Classen (1) recognized acute pancreatitis and described its pathological picture. Soon after this, in 1850, Claude Bernard (2) induced the first experimental pancreatitis by injecting oil and bile into the pancreatic duct of animals.</description><creator>Beck, Ivan.

The observation of this phenomenon is reported. The previously unreported nuclide Si25 beta decays to proton emitting excited states of Al25. The half-life of Si25 is 0.3 +0.2/-0.1 sec. Proton lines from the decay of Si25 dominate the delayed proton spectra following the bombardment of both 13Al and 14Si with 97 Mev protons. Si25 has (Z, N) of the form (2k+2, 2k-1) and is parent to a decay chain of the form: (2k+2, 2k-1) –(B+)-&gt; (2k+1, 2k) – (p)-&gt; (2k, 2k). It appears that bombardment of both element (2k+1) and element (2k+2) leads to delayed proton spectra dominated by lines from the decay of nuclide (2k+2, 2k-1). This should hold for k from 2 to 9 inclusive. Using this assumption, all the observed spectra are completely explained. Thus the observation of the previously unreported nuclides O13, Ne17 and Mg21 is tentatively claimed; spin-parity information on these nuclides and on various states of their daughter nuclides is deduced.</description><creator>Barton, Richard.

One is the view advanced by Spence (1936) that excitatory and inhibitory tendencies to each stimulus are built up irrespective of the opportunity or lack of opportunity to compare the positive and negative stimuli. The other is the relational hypothesis, that subjects learn by comparing one stimulus with another, and that the amount of opportunity for comparison of stimuli affects the rate of learning. In support of the relational hypothesis, Loess and Duncan (1952), using human subjects, found that the learning of a difficult pattern discrimination under conditions of simultaneous presentation, which permits direct comparison of stimuli, was faster than with successive presentation.</description><creator>Barkentin, Elizabeth.

It is a hookworm belonging to the family Ancylostomatidae Looss, 1905, sub-family Bunostomatinae Looss, 1911. The parasite was originally described by Schwartz (1925) who named it Uncinaria lotoris. Chandler (1942) transferred it to the genus Arthrocephalus Ortlepp, 1925. Webster (1956) placed the worm in a new genus, Placoconus. Although Placoconus lotoris has been known for a comparatively long time, very little work has been done on its biology. The parasite when present in large numbers appears to affect adversely the health of the raccoon which is one of the fur-bearing animals of North America.</description><creator>Balasingham, E.</creator><contributor>Cameron, T.

Whereas formerly chronic illness referred to a disease “which is progressive, steadily or with remissions, towards severe crippling or death,” it is now defined as a “long-term disease which might be cured if given adequate prolonged treatment or which might remit for long periods after treatment, enabling the patient to return to worth while living.” Coupled with this new perspective has been the development of the therapeutic community which calls for the treatment of the patient as a 'total individual' and not simply as a personified diagnosis.</description><creator>Backler, Alan.
