This thesis addresses this lacuna in an examination of the form and design of imagined nations in Scotland and Quebec. I argue that the Scottish National Party and the Parti Quebecois have, since their advent in the 1960s, created a political-civic image of the nation that breaks with previous cultural conceptions. However, cultural images of the nation, propagated by centralist institutions, remain entrenched in contemporary Scotland and Quebec. The juxtaposition of centralist cultural images and nationalist political images of the nation have led to a dualistic, or what I have termed a 'Jekyll and Hyde', national consciousness in both countries. This exercise indicates that images of the nation are subject to multitudinous interpretations and (re)construction by various actors in the competitive state-nation political arena.</description><creator>Pickles, Eve V.</creator><contributor>Meadwell, Hudson (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Nationalism -- Québec (Province)</subject><subject>Parti québécois.</subject><subject>Québec (Province) -- History -- Autonomy and independence movements.</subject><subject>Scotland -- History -- Autonomy and independence movements.</subject><subject>Scottish National Party.</subject><subject>Nationalism -- Scotland.</subject><title>The politics of imagining nations : a comparative analysis of the Scottish National Party and the Parti quebecois since the 1960s</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vq27zq361.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kp78gj17p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3b591b17z</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:52:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Bock and Aitkin (1981) developed an EM algorithm for the maximum marginal likelihood estimation of parametric item response curves, such that these estimates could be obtained in the absence of the estimation of examinee parameters. Using functional data analytic techniques described by Ramsay and Silverman (1997), this algorithm is extended to achieve nonparametric estimates of item response functions. Unlike their parametric counterparts, nonparametric functions have the freedom to adopt any possible shape, making the current approach an attractive alternative to the popular three-parameter logistic model. A basis function expansion is described for the item response functions, as is a roughness penalty which mediates a compromise between the fit of the data and the smoothness of the estimate. The algorithm is developed and applied to both actual and simulated data to illustrate its performance, and how the nonparametric estimates compare to results obtained through more classical methods.</description><creator>Rossi, Natasha T.</creator><contributor>Ramsay, James O.

Against Heresies [= AH] III.xviii.1).This thesis attempts to clarify the mystery of evil through an analysis and contemporary restatement of Irenaeus of Lyons' theology interpreted as a 'Christocentric theodicy.' 'Theodicy' is here defined as God's response in the Gospel of Jesus Christ to suffering and the theological interpretation of that response. The response begins and ends with the cross as proclaimed in the Eucharist, that is, with God's own self-offering. It is argued that God allows suffering because He knows that only by the thankful union of our fallen knowledge of sin and death with the offering of Christ can we attain to a knowledge of eternal life: our adoption by the Father. Put otherwise, God's love for creation, and, therefore, His nature as a good and just Being, can be seen in the economy of salvation where evil is allowed to exist so that it might be transformed into good. The Introduction states the primary assumptions and limitations of the thesis' argument. Part I examines Irenaeus' Christocentric theology with particular emphasis on his understanding of the economy of salvation. Part II, building upon Part I, argues for a contemporary 'economic' or 'Christocentric' theodicy. The Conclusion recapitulates the whole thesis.</description><creator>Gallaher, Brandon.</creator><contributor>Farrow, Douglas (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Irenaeus, Saint, Bishop of Lyon</subject><subject>Theodicy.</subject><title>That we might love him the more : an Irenaean theodicy built on Christ crucified</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nv9354789.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2v23vv988</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Religious Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5425kc48q</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:52:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Why have numerous peace agreements not led to peace? Peacemaking evolves within a specific social, political and economic context involving different actors, numerous issues, and domestic and international constraints. However, political leaders ultimately prioritize the interests of the nation, politicize issues, and initialize policies. The study proposes, first, that the belief system and perceptions of political leaders play an important role in the making of peace by directly influencing the political environment during the implementation phase of peace agreements. Second, the main obstacle to peace may lie within the leaders' failure to transform the political environment into one more conducive to peace. A theoretical model attempts to bridge the gap between leaders, implementation phases, and outcome, or impact on the political environment. The process of transformation results from three factors: trust, increased direct communication, and a positive alteration of the image of the opponent. This provides the necessary foundation for both leaders and populations to begin the difficult and shaky process of belief alterations and perception corrections. The cases of the Camp David Agreements leading to the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty of 1979, and the Oslo Accords of 1993 provide the basis for "probing" into the relevancy of these propositions.</description><creator>Fontaine-Skronski, Kim.</creator><contributor>Brecher, Michael (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Leadership.</subject><subject>Reconciliation.</subject><subject>Arab-Israeli conflict -- 1993- -- Peace.</subject><title>The making of peace : the role of leaders in the implementation of peace agreements</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128ng46p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5425kc48q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2j62s6564</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:52:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Generally labelled as fantastic in nature, Maupassant's short stories pose a serious problem. The very term "fantastic" is itself highly ambiguous; there have been many attemps to define what makes a work of literature "fantastic" in nature, but none of these attempts have managed to capture the essence of the genre in its entirety. What is most striking in Maupassant's narratives is precisely his rejection of the fantastic almost as soon as it occurs. Contrary to the more traditional literature of the fantastic, his narratives remain anchored in a realistic world, rendering the reader's experience even more unsettling. In a sense, Maupassant manages to tame the fantastic by normalizing it. We intend, therefore, to position our work at the meeting point of these two concepts---realism and fantasy---in order to determine if the definition of "fantastic realism" we will be striving for can be verified through our analysis of the following stories: "Apparition", "La chevelure", "Le Horla" (first version), "La main", "La peur", "Magnetisme" and "Sur 1'eau".

Most of these people were taken by the military to clandestine prisons where they were tortured and killed. The children of these victims were also seized, and pregnant women were kept alive long enough to give birth. An estimated five hundred infants and young children of the disappeared were given for adoption to highly connected families.

Preliminary studies focussed on the production of polyclonal antisera against BoNT/E by immunizing a rabbit with botulinal toxoid type E. The antiserum was subsequently used to detect BoNT/E using the slot blot immunoassay where samples were applied to a slot blot filtration manifold and drawn by vacuum through a membrane. The membrane was then immunologically processed before chemiluminescent detection. However, the antisera lacked specificity and cross-reacted with closely related clostridia strains. The specificity of the antisera was increased by adsorbing cross-reactive antibodies from whole antisera with affinity columns made with total proteins from culture supernatants of closely related clostridia. Alternatively, specific antibodies were isolated with an affinity column prepared with C. botulinum type E toxoid. Different methods of concentrating BoNT/E in each sample prior to testing them were evaluated to increase the sensitivity of the assay. The slot blot immunoassay was then evaluated for detection of BoNT/E in mixed cultures and in food samples.

Most patients with early-stage endometrial carcinoma are treated with hysterectomy. The knowledge of the stage of disease could impact greatly on the eventual therapeutic decision. Numerous studies have investigated the use of endovaginal ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the preoperative staging of endometrial carcinoma. Although a number of studies have demonstrated no significant difference in the accuracy of MR imaging and endovaginal US in assessing myometrial invasion, more recently, dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging has been found to be significantly superior to the non-enhanced T2-weighted MR imaging in the preoperative evaluation of endometrial carcinoma. Purpose. (1) To evaluate prospectively the relative accuracy of endovaginal US (including Doppler) and MR imaging using phased array pelvic multicoil in the preoperative staging of endometrial carcinoma with histopathological correlation on the same patient population, (2) To determine whether the addition of contrast-enhanced MR sequences to high resolution fast spinecho (FSE) T2-weighted sequences, can improve the diagnostic accuracy of staging endometrial carcinoma.

The objective of this thesis is to criticise this elitist and essentialist interpretation of social change. It proposes a conceptual alternative that could take into consideration the profound mutation in state and society relations between 1944 and 1960, a mutation that facilitated the advent of the welfare state in Quebec. Based on a theory of civil society as a sphere of interaction between the state and the individual, the thesis demonstrates that the Quiet Revolution was the result of the development of a new ethos that favoured the values of social justice, participation and equality which contributed to undermining the foundations of the Duplessis regime.</description><creator>Turgeon, Luc.</creator><contributor>Gagnon, Alain-G.

Complex problems, common for this special group of patients, place them at risk for delayed discharge. Discharge planning, for these patients, has become an increasingly critical activity for social workers. This study examined factors that predict the risks for inappropriate hospitalization for 244 patients waiting for LTC in 1999, and it explored the LTC application process to identify barriers to delayed discharges. It was found that 63% of the hospitalization of these patients was inappropriate. System related factors, such as the timing of the LTC application, were identified as predictors. Timeline investigations revealed areas for improvement in the discharge process and were discussed with a view to social work implementation, for example, the introduction of a high-risk screening protocol.</description><creator>Thompson, Margit.</creator><contributor>Duder, Sydney (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Older people -- Hospital care -- Ontario.</subject><subject>Long-term care facilities -- Ontario.</subject><title>Long term care patients in acute care hospitals : examining the discharge barriers</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t722hb53g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jm214q92w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:td96k446s</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:52:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Recent technological advances (such as digitization) and economic shifts (such as privatization and liberalization) have radically changed the telecommunications landscape. Internet Telephony is one of the most important developments that has resulted from digitization. It raises several legal-regulatory issues at both domestic and international levels. This thesis analyzes the existing legal-regulatory framework for Internet Telephony in Latin America, and examines its implications and potential developments in the region. In order to provide a more solid foundation for this analysis, the first chapter provides an overview of the traditional regulatory framework, and describes the technological and economic underpinnings of Internet Telephony. The second chapter studies the regulatory frameworks for Internet Telephony that have been adopted by Canada, the United States and the European Union. These frameworks could serve as models and provide further guidance to analyze the approaches taken to regulate Internet Telephony in Latin America. Finally, the third chapter examines the three existing legal-regulatory approaches to Internet Telephony that have been adopted in Latin America and its potential implications.</description><creator>Zuniga Rodriguez, Ricardo Francisco.</creator><contributor>Handa, Sunny (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Law.</subject><subject>Mass Communications.</subject><title>A comparative analysis of internet protocol telephony in Latin America /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k643b292p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/td96k446s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:02870x685</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:52:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Following slavery, capital punishment is slowly finding its way toward abolition. This trend is manifested both in international criminal law norms and international human rights norms. In the international criminal law field, capital punishment, accepted under the Nuremberg and Tokyo Charters, was rejected half a century later in the Statute of the International Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia, then in the Statute of the International Tribunal for Rwanda, and most recently in the Rome Statute. Parallel to developments in the international criminal law field, a similar evolution was experienced in the area of international human rights. The trend towards abolition in the human rights field began with the restriction of the death penalty application to a certain group of people and crimes. However, a European human rights instrument, Protocol No. 6 to the ECHR, shifted the trend from restriction to abolition of the death penalty. For the abolitionist cause to succeed, the abolitionist trend should be accepted by retentionist countries such as the US and the Islamic states of the Middle East and Africa.

Some see the reforms as sounding the death-knell of the profession. Indeed, the invasion of computers in daily life and legal affairs has resulted in the 'dematerialization' of contracts, and even in the disappearance of notary, replaced by a virtual substitute. However, many think the reforms shall be beneficial to the profession once the parameters of electronic formalism are settled. First, the notary remains the cornerstone for the authenticity of juridical acts in that his or her actual presence, materialized by his or her signature, guarantees the perfection and effectiveness of notarial acts, whether drafted on paper or electronic medium. Secondly, his or her role as expert and as counsel will expand in this new environment and contribute to the consolidation of his or her central role in the regulation of society.</description><creator>Trân, Thuy-Nam-Tran.</creator><contributor>Kasirer, Nicolas (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Law.</subject><title>L'acte authentique notarie electronique</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xd07gv42t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3197xn48t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zs25xb37t</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:52:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>"Good faith", as a technical legal term, has been recognized in many legal systems around the world as a general principle of contract law. However, in Canadian common law of contract, the doctrine still has not been explicitly recognized due to some doubts cast on the doctrine. This thesis will first deal with various criticisms presented by the doctrine opponents. Next, the effect and utility of the doctrine and the relationship between "good faith" and concepts in equity and corporate law will be examined. It will be finally concluded that explicit recognition of good faith would help form a more functional body of law.</description><creator>Zhang, Ruowei, 1971-</creator><contributor>Swan, John (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Law.</subject><title>Good faith in Canadian contract Law</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/47429c047.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zs25xb37t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cz30pv48d</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:52:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Chapter 1 of this thesis will describe the problem of unruly passengers and try to outline and explain some of the possible reasons for this phenomenon. Afterwards, the existing legal system will be analysed and scrutinized for its effectiveness. Currently, the system to prosecute unruly passengers does not govern the problem to its whole extent so that many offences, especially minor ones, generally stay unpunished. In addition, it contains several loopholes and States do not provide sufficient law enforcement. This is partly due to insufficient rules of jurisdiction since powers of jurisdiction and prosecution can be allocated to several States. After this analysis, with reference to the ICAO proposal on how to solve the problem, suggestions will be made for the improvement of the existing system in order to govern the problem as a whole. Finally, the question of how to implement such improvements will be addressed. Chapter 2 will deal with passenger rights that are applicable to the problem of unruly passengers. Therefore, the rights of fellow passengers in terms of civil liability of the airline and of an unruly passenger will be outlined. Next, the rights of an unruly passenger himself in cases of mistreatment and blacklisting will be addressed. Although the unruly passenger breaks the law he possesses rights, which must be respected under the rule of law. Finally, a connection between this phenomenon and the "passenger-rights movement" will be drawn.</description><creator>Giesecke, Christian.</creator><date>2002</date><subject>Law.</subject><title>Unruly passengers and passenger rights : a legal perspective on handling unruly behaviour taking into account the rights of passengers</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j3860870r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cz30pv48d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qr46r2868</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:52:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The last few years have seen scientific advancements that were thought to be possible only in the realm of science fiction. From nuclear transfer to exogenous pregnancies, implantable brain chips to transgenic engineering, cyborg to chimera, we may be taking the next step in our own evolution. As barriers between the species begin to blur and blend, should humans retain special elevated status? How will these affect notions of "personhood"? In this thesis, I analyze and review the literature of classical ethical, religious and legal definitions of personhood. I explore which significant developments in biotechnology may affect evolving legal and ethical notions of personhood; I also outline a rubric for considering the definition and scope of the human identity as "person" from different research perspectives, including legal, philosophical, ethical and technological. Finally, I examine whether or not there is a recurrent theme, a common thread, commensurability, some unifying underlying principle, in philosophical and theological perspectives and in the decisions made by courts, legislatures, and governmental agencies.

This issue lies at the core of the inherent tension between the promotion of free trade and the traditional territorial allocation of intellectual property rights. Parallel import refers to the unauthorized sale of genuine branded products in a given jurisdiction through market channels without the consent of the trade-mark owner in that jurisdiction. The exhaustion of rights doctrine is one of the most fundamental limitations on intellectual property rights as it provides, in general terms, that once an intellectual property right holder sells an article embodying those rights he no longer has any authority to control the future sale or movement of this article because his right have been exhausted with respect to that article. This inextricable link between parallel imports and the exhaustion of rights will thus be the focus of our analysis throughout this thesis.</description><creator>Haller, Julie.</creator><contributor>Lametti, David (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Law.</subject><title>The legality of the parallel import of trade-marked goods : a comparative analysis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4b29b788k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gx41mk71g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mw22v732x</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:52:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Prospects of securing affordable and efficient development finance for Central and Eastern European countries largely depends upon development of international securitizaton in the region, which is characterized by an undercapitalized banking sector and weak domestic investors' base.

(1) To estimate cancer incidence in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) as compared to the general population. (2) To estimate the sensitivity and specificity of methods of cancer ascertainment. (3) To determine the prevalence of malignancy risk factors in SLE. Methods. (1) We determined the incidence of malignancy in the Montreal General Hospital (MGH) lupus cohort, through linkage with the Quebec tumor registry. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRS) were generated, using Quebec population rates. In addition, a meta-analysis was performed by pooling data from eight cohort studies of malignancy in SLE. (2) We administered a postal survey to cohort members to determine risk factors for cancer and self-report of cancer occurrence. For dead or lost-to-follow-up patients, data was abstracted from charts. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of self-report and chart review for cancer ascertainment, compared to registry linkage results. (3) Using the data collected on self-report and chart review, we compared risk factor prevalence within the MGH cohort to that of the Quebec population. Results. (1) Observed cancers in our cohort were greater than what would be expected; for all cancers, the SIR was 1.8 (95% Confidence Interval 1.2--2.6). The meta-analysis SIR (for all malignancies) was 1.67 (1.42--1.94). Postal survey and chart review methods demonstrated high specificity. Sensitivity was imperfect, but did not greatly effect estimation of the SIR estimate. (2) Our lupus cohort had a distinct profile of risk factors for malignancy compared to the general population; differences included more prevalent nulliparity, obesity, and use of hormone replacement therapy. Conclusions. The risk of malignancy in SLE patients is increased. Risk factor profiles could influence the incidence of certain malignancies in SLE.</description><creator>Bernatsky, Sasha.</creator><contributor>Boivin, J. F.

We tested the hypothesis that MSCs can be recruited to the heart upon myocardial infarction, and play pathophysiological roles in the subsequent healing and adaptation process. An animal model was created with labeled MSCs in its bone marrow and then a myocardial infarction produced. Donor MSCs from isogenic Lewis rats were harvested, multiplied in culture and labelled. Labelled cells were intravenously injected into the recipient rats and one week later upon the engraftment of these labelled MSCs within the bone marrow, rats underwent a coronary artery ligation or sham operation. The hearts were removed at various time points and the presence of labelled cells in the heart was confirmed and their phenotypes identified. We confirmed the presence of labelled cells in the rat bone marrows and the presence of labelled cells in the infarcted myocardium at all time points studied, but not in the normal hearts. There was evidence for myogenic differentiation with some labelled cells expressing smooth muscle/myofibroblast phenotypes and appearing to participate in vasculogenesis. Our evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that myocardial infarction may send a signal to recruit MSCs to the injured heart, where they undergo milieu-dependent differentiation. The ability of these cells to express various phenotypes may allow them to participate in the pathophysiology of post-infarct remodeling and angiogenesis. Therapeutic implantation of MSCs thus may further enhance such effects.</description><creator>Bittira, Bindu.</creator><contributor>Chiu, Ray C-J (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Shum-Tim, Dominique (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>Bone marrow stromal cells in the tissue repair process following myocardial infarction</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6q182n03z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xw42n972s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:44558g015</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:52:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Methylmercury (MeHg) is an environmental contaminant mainly present in fish and seafood.

Shared environmental factors were not implicated. Pregnancy, labour/delivery and neonatal complications (PLDNC) were often associated to ADHD. However, no investigations aimed at delineating the shared/non-shared nature of these factors were reported. In order to identify PLDNC which are more likely to be non-shared, we recruited 65 children with ADHD and assessed their history for PLDNC. 45 of them had non-affected siblings that were also assessed for PLDNC. Compared to their non-affected siblings, ADHD children had significantly higher neonatal complications (p = 0.01). Furthermore, neonatal complications were associated with higher motor activity (p = 0.04) and attention deficits (p = 0.03) in ADHD diagnosed children, suggesting that neonatal complications are more likely to be non-shared environmental factors of etiological relevance to ADHD.</description><creator>Ben Amor, Leila.</creator><contributor>Grizenko, N.

La majorité des cancers colorectaux sont soit                localement ou régionalement invasifs au moment du diagnostic, limitant les options de                traitements et réduisant les taux de survies. Plusieurs études épidémiologiques et                laboratoires suggèrent une relation entre le développent du cancer du colon et des                facteurs exogènes, tel que le régime alimentaire. L'effet immunomodulateur des                bactéries probiotiques a été postulé; cependant, en raison de l'efficacité clinique                réduite et d'autres limitations qui y sont associées, elles n'ont pas été conçues                comme une thérapie préventive du cancer.

The immunomodulatory effect of probiotic                bacteria has been postulated earlier; however, due to low clinical efficacy and                associated limitations they have not been devised as cancer theraphy and preventative                procedures. One of the main obstacles is the efficient delivery of live bacterial                cells to targeted sites. The work contained in this dissertation aims to develop and                evaluate a yogurt based formulation containing microencapsulated live probiotic                bacterial cells for use in colon cancer prevention and theraphy. Alginate –                poly-L-lysine – alginate (APA) and alginate-chitosan (AC) microcapsule systems have                been optimized, prepared and characterized. Survival of Lactobacillus acidophilus                cells and mechanical stability of the microcapsules were evaluated in various pH                conditions in presence of yogurt and simulated gastrointestinal fluids. The physical                properties of the microcapsules were investigated using a computer controlled dynamic                simulated human gastrointestinal (GI) model. Results show that the APA microcapsule                system was more robust, had higher retention capacity, preserved better bacterial                viability and had greater resistance to GI environment.

Pourtant, les implications sanitaires d'une telle                pratique pour l'irrigation des plantes comestibles ne sont pas encore bien comprises.                Cette étude vise à examiner les bénéfices et risques associés à la réutilisation des                eaux grises pour arroser les jardins potagers domestiques. Il met son focus sur la                possibilité de contamination des légumes par des organismes pathogéniques et les                métaux lourdes qui peuvent être présents dans les refuts domestiques. Les eaux grises                d'une famille montréalaise ont été collectionnés et analysés pour des paramètres de                base, y inclut les pathogènes et les métaux lourds, sur une période de 8 semaines.                Pendant ce temps, ces eaux grises ont été utilisés à irriguer des plantations                individuels de laitues, carottes, et poivrons rouges dans une serre de recherche.                L'eau du robinet a servi comme contrôle.

However, the sanitary implications of reusing greywater to water edible crops remain                uncertain. This study examined the benefits and risks associated with domestic                greywater reuse for the purposes of vegetable garden irrigation. Untreated (settled                only) and treated (settling and slow sand filtration) greywater collected from a                family home was analyzed for basic water quality parameters, over a period of eight                weeks. During that time, both greywaters were used to irrigate individually potted                plots of lettuce, carrots and peppers in a greenhouse. Tap water was used as control.                Upon maturity, plants were harvested and the edible portions tested for fecal                coliforms and fecal streptococci, common indicators for the presence of pathogenic                microorganisms. Heavy metals were not detected in the greywater, but both fecal                coliforms and fecal streptococci were present in high levels, averaging 4 x 105/100mL                and 2 x 103/100mL of greywater, respectively. Despite these high counts, no                significant difference in contamination levels was observed between crops irrigated                with tap water, untreated and treated greywaters. Fecal coliform levels were highest                in carrots and fecal streptococcus levels highest on lettuce leaves. However,                contamination levels for all crops were low and do not represent a significant health                risk. Plant growth and productivity were unaffected by the water quality, owing to                the low N, P and K levels of the greywater.

This definition is needed for observing and documenting reflective                practice in research, education, and continuing professional development. The current                exploratory research aims to operationalize "reflective learning" using a conceptual                framework based on a comprehensive review of the relevant literature, and to validate                this framework in the context of a medium-large scale study of brief self-directed                e-learning activities in continuing medical education. Properties of reflective                learning were identified in a literature review on reflective learning and higher                order thinking. These properties were structured and represented in a conceptual                framework, herein called the Reflective Learning Framework. Then, this framework was                revised, and a related coding scheme was tested in a pilot study. The revised                framework was validated in a qualitative multiple case study that involved 473 family                physicians participating in writing comments and interviews. The written comments                resulted in 1,776 comment cases, and 253 interview cases. A comment case was defined                as one family physician reading, rating, and commenting on one research-based                synopsis online. An interview case was defined as one family physician reading and                rating a synopsis online, and then explaining the rationale of his/her rating. Using                thematic analysis and the framework-related coding scheme, cognitive tasks observed                in these cases were categorized. Then, using cross case analysis, frequency counts of                each category in all cases were compared in matrices.</description><description>Résumé L'absence d'une définition opérationnelle de                l'apprentissage réflexif est habituellement reconnue. Cette définition est nécessaire                pour observer et documenter la pratique réflexive en recherche, en éducation et en                développement professionnel continu. La présente recherche explicative vise à                opérationnaliser l'apprentissage réflexif avec un cadre conceptuel et à valider ce                cadre dans le contexte des activités de formation en ligne en éducation médicale                continue (e-learning). Une revue de la littérature sur l'apprentissage réflexif et le                « higher order thinking » a permis d'identifier les caractéristiques de                l'apprentissage réflexif. Ces caractéristiques ont été organisées et représentées                dans un cadre conceptuel (Reflective Learning Framework). Ce cadre conceptuel et la                grille de codage correspondante ont été révisés lors d'une étude pilote. Le cadre                conceptuel révisé a ensuite été validé par une étude qualitative de cas multiples qui                incluait des cas « commentaires » fournis par 473 médecins de famille, et des cas «                entrevues » fournis par 40 médecins de famille et six médecins spécialistes.                Concernant les commentaires, un cas est défini comme étant un médecin de famille qui                lit, évalue et commente, sur Internet, un synopsis d'article de recherche. Concernant                les entrevues, un cas est défini comme étant un médecin de famille qui lit et évalue                un synopsis sur Internet, et qui explique la logique sur laquelle repose son                évaluation. Les commentaires écrits ont contribué à 1.776 cas « commentaires », et                les transcriptions d'entrevues à 253 cas.
