The several factors of: array of hardware; proliferation of space capability; constant presence of man in orbit; variety of activities; and multiplicity of participants, all coalesce to create an unprecedented era in man's conquest of space. In addition to these scientific and technological developments, this thesis addresses the policy implications for all the current participants in the Space Stations' Era. This is then applied to the US/International Space Station project to assess the legal implications which this precedental co-operative venture provokes. Thus, the status of the co-operative instrument, structures for the efficient management of the project and the commercial law applicable to the venture are all dealt with. The shift of focus from the specific to the general is completed through a treatment of the military realities of space station utilization, the protection of the environment through the medium of the NPS issue, and the operation of global space law in this era as exemplified by the Registration Convention. The thesis concludes with a call for patience, foresight and vigilance to ensure and promote space democratization to the betterment of mankind.</description><creator>Young, Andrew J., 1960-</creator><date>1987</date><subject>Law.</subject><title>Law and policy in the Space Stations' Era</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9019s311r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n583xv65w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Civil Law</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2227mq391</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Infection of L cells with reovirus results in a gradual inhibition of host protein synthesis and a concomitant increase in viral specific protein synthesis. Previous in vitro studies using cell-free extracts from uninfected and infected cells suggested that the observed pattern of protein synthesis in infected cells is the consequence of a transition of the host translational apparatus from cap dependence to cap independence. To test this hypothesis, it was necessary to demonstrate that mRNA being translated at late times in infected cells was uncapped. Progeny subviral particles synthesize the bulk of the viral mRNA present in infected cells at late times after infection. Therefore, progeny subviral particles were isolated and the mRNA synthesized by these particles was subjected to 5' terminal analysis. The results of these experiments indicated that progeny subviral particles synthesize uncapped mRNA with the 5' terminal structure pGpC... . Examination of the 5' termini of reovirus mRNA's associated with polyribosomes at different times post infection clearly showed that uncapped viral mRNAs (pG... terminated) were translated with increasing predominance as a function of time after infection. Thus, at late times only uncapped viral mRNAs were translated, while capped host mRNAs, although still present in infected cells, were excluded from polyribosomes. It was concluded from these findings that the mechanism for takeover of protein synthesis by reovirus involves a transition to cap independent translation coupled to the synthesis of large quantities of uncapped viral mRNAs. Further studies indicated that crude initiation factor preparations from uninfected L cells restored the ability of cell-free extracts from infected cells to translate capped mRNAs. Crude initiation factor preparations from late infected cells did not have restoring activity. Numerous studies have shown that cap binding proteins present among eucaryotic initiation factors facilitate transla</description><creator>Zarbl, Helmut.</creator><date>1983</date><subject>Biology, Microbiology.</subject><title>The structure and translation of late reovirus mRNA in infected L cells /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w0892b49t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2227mq391</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6d56zx21j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Continuing activity in the Upper Ordovician mudrocks of the Montreal area for manufacturing purposes and construction encouraged this study of their weathering behavior in relation to composition and microstructure. The mudrocks are grouped into four primary lithological divisions based on clay contents. Illite, chlorite and small amounts of mixed-layer clay minerals are present in similar proportions throughout all microlithologies. The distribution of calcium and magnesium in X-ray scanning images indicates that carbonates are present as silt grains rather than as cement. The specific surface of the mudrocks ranges from 2 to 20 m('2)/g for nitrogen and from 15 to 40 m('2)/g for water vapor. The higher degree of susceptibility to moisture of the more clay-rich facies is attributed to their greater parallelism of microstructure, the presence of mesopores (2-50 nm) and less compacted packing. Changes in apparent cohesion at the menisci of capillary held water in the irregular network of passages appear to occur as cycles of adsorption and desorption proceed, resulting in the opening and closing of cracks and intermittent crack development.</description><creator>Kim, Chun-soo.</creator><date>1984</date><subject>Geology, Stratigraphic -- Ordovician.</subject><subject>Argillite -- Québec (Province) -- Laprairie Region -- Moisture.</subject><title>The influence of composition and microlithology on the weathering susceptibility of Ordovician mudrock in the Montréal, Québec area /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p8418n91j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6d56zx21j</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geological Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qv33rx308</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><creator>Mennasemay, Maimire</creator><date>1979</date><subject>Language and languages.</subject><subject>Africa -- Study and teaching.</subject><subject>Political science -- Language.</subject><subject>Communication in politics.</subject><title>Language and comparative politics : a study of systematic distortion in comparative political science discourse with special reference to African studies</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xk81jm066.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qv33rx308</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kw52j863v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><creator>Bruce, Keith Richard</creator><date>1979</date><subject>Glycoproteins</subject><subject>Mucopolysaccharidosis</subject><subject>Estrogen -- Therapeutic use</subject><title>The carbohydrate moieties of mucopoly-saccharides and gycoproteins of avian tissues and the effect of estrogen administration.</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tx31qj34w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kw52j863v</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Agricultural Chemistry and Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:dn39x204f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><creator>Soare, Antoine</creator><date>1977</date><subject>Death in literature.</subject><subject>Corneille, Pierre, 1606-1684 -- Tragedies.</subject><title>Mythologie du meurtre et de la mort dans les tragédies de P.

In this regard, we take as our motivation two of the  most exciting recent developments in theoretical physics; namely the AdS/CFT  correspondence and the RS and ADD brane world scenarios. We examine how our  understanding of branes originally developed, both as fundamental extended objects  from string theory and as a phenomenologically viable description of the universe,  where we are thought to reside on a brane located in a higher dimensional bulk. We  then discuss the AdS/CFT correspondence in which branes are used to study a  conjectured duality between gravity in D dimensions and gauge theories in (D - 1)  dimensions. It is in this context that the AdS soliton geometry first arises, as it  proves quite useful for studying ordinary QCD-like gauge theories from the point of  view of supergravity. We follow this by a discussion of how to make a viable brane  world in six dimensions using the AdS soliton. We further discuss the cosmology of  this and other related six dimensional models. After this, we generalize the AdS  soliton to an arbitrary number of dimensions, greater than six, and compactify the  extra dimensions so as to have a realistic low-energy effective theory in the  standard four dimensions. We examine several realizations of the AdS soliton in  higher dimensions, both analytically and numerically, and touch upon how it can  nicely solve the hierarchy problem of scales in physics. Finally, we also briefly  consider the cosmology of an AdS soliton brane world.</description><creator>Roebke, Joshua</creator><contributor>Cline, James (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Physics, Elementary Particles and High Energy.</subject><subject>Physics, Astronomy and Astrophysics.</subject><title>The AdS soliton and brane world scenarios in arbitrary dimensions /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6108vb97v.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bc13r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:t722h945k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Objective. The aim of this naturalistic study is to examine  whether a sample of subjects showed improvements in their defensive functioning  after undergoing psychoanalysis. Methods. Seventeen subjects from the Penn Psychoanalytic  Treatment Collection with completed, tape-recorded psychoanalyses had their defense  mechanisms rated both for early and late sessions. Results. The pre-post effect size for the change in overall  defensive functioning (ODF) of the sample was large (0.76) and statistically  significant. The percentage of subjects who improved (71%) in their ODF was similar  to that found by others who studied the same sample using general functioning  measures. Conclusions. These findings provide the first empirical evidence  to support a sustained trait-like change in dynamic personality functioning in  patients who have undergone psychoanalysis. Future randomized and controlled studies  with homogeneous samples are needed to further confirm these  findings.</description><creator>Roy, Carmella A.</creator><contributor>Perry, J.

The major components are shown  to be detrital material such as silicates and clay minerals and neutralization  products such as gypsum and metal hydroxides. X-ray mapping and progressive sludge leaching experiments are  performed to locate the major nickel bearing species. Progressive leaching was  performed for two hours at pH 4, 3.5, and 3. It is observed that there is incomplete  nickel extraction for all leach conditions. X-ray mapping establishes that the  remaining nickel is due to minor amounts of Ni/S and Ni/O and more significantly  colloidal sized nickel-silicon-aluminum complexes; which seem to result from  neutralization. Charge contrast imaging was also considered for  characterization. It was studied on the mineral gibbsite to establish optimum  working conditions for maximum contrast. Pressure, working distance, bias, scan rate  and beam current are varied independently while the specimen current was monitored.  Maximum contrast is shown to occur consistently at a specimen current of 3 nA. This  implies that the user can operate over a wide range of conditions as long as the  specimen current is maintained at its optimum value. This technique is then applied  to the analysis of precipitated nickel hydroxides. Charge contrast proved not too  informative because the particles are too small. Large electron doses at high  magnifications can mask the subtle variation in local charging.</description><creator>Robertson, Kevin</creator><contributor>Gauvin, Raynald (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Finch, Jim (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Environmental.</subject><title>Characterization of nickel hydroxide sludge using the variable pressure SEM</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qv33rx25d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p8418n85d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hh63sw47t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Epithelial morphogenesis is an important signaling program in  normal embryonic development involving cell proliferation, migration, invasion and  cell matrix turnover and also during tumourigenesis. The Crk adaptor family of  proteins has been implicated as promoters and mediators of such biological responses  downstream of various extracellular signals. Our laboratory has defined the  involvement of Crk adaptor proteins in the signaling of Met-dependent  anchorage-independent growth, cell dispersal, cell invasion and epithelial  morphogenesis. In an MDCK epithelial cell model CrkII overexpression was sufficient  to promote cell spreading. This initial biological response was dependent on Rac  activity. In Chapter 3 I demonstrate that MDCK cells overexpressing CrkII  unstimulated, or stimulated with HGF, exhibit higher levels of activated Rac1. In an  attempt to validate the function of Crk during cell migration and invasion I have  developed targeted siRNAs to CrkI/II and CrkL and assessed their impact in the  disruption of migration and invasion of cancer cell lines. In Chapter 4 I  demonstrate that siRNAs promote a specific decrease in the level of Crk adaptor  proteins. Notably this decrease impairs motility and invasion of several human tumor  cell lines. I provide evidence that a role for Crk during cell migration or invasion  is to promote the formation of cell matrix adhesion contacts necessary for cell  spreading and migration. These studies have established that Crk adaptor proteins  are required and may be key promoters of cell migration events during  tumorigenesis.</description><creator>Rodrigues, Sonia Patricia</creator><contributor>Park, Morag (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2004</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>The function of the Crk adapter proteins in cell migration and invasion /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w9505111m.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hh63sw47t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:st74cr01f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The growth hormone receptor gene (GHR) has been previously  documented to be a good candidate gene for detection of a quantitative trait locus  (QTL) which influences milk production in Holstein cattle. In this study, the  promoter region of the GHR gene and microsatellite markers AGAL29 and BM5004 were  studied. Their effects on milk yield (MY), fat yield (FY), protein yield (PY), fat  percentage (FP) and protein percentage (PP) were examined. DNA was isolated from  1746 used by the artificial insemination (AI) industry representing 26 half-sibling  families. Three polymorphisms in the GHR gene were genotyped (GHRAlu, GHRAcc and GHR  Stu) along with both microsatellites. The markers were analyzed in a cross-family  analysis. The model included a population mean, a fixed grandsire effect, a fixed  allele effect and a random residual error. The data was also analyzed using a nested  model in a granddaughter design to investigate a possible consistency in the allelic  effect in individual families. Lastly, the data was analyzed using the haplotypes of  GHRAlu and GHR Acc, using the same model as the cross-family analysis. It included  an analysis of a fixed haplotype effect instead of a fixed allele effect. (Abstract  shortened by UMI.)</description><creator>Richard, Marilyn</creator><contributor>Zadworny, D.

The inoculant contained multi strains of  Lactobacillus plantarum developed by Pioneer Hi-Bred Inc. In the first study, the  effects of inoculation on ensiling characteristics of alfalfa were determined in a  completely randomized design using 30 mini-silos. In the 2nd study, 9 containers  were used in a completely randomized design to determine the effect of inoculation  on the aerobic stability of alfalfa silage. In the 3d study, 2 ruminally fistulated  cows were used in a randomized complete block design to determine the effects of  inoculation on ruminal degradation of alfalfa silage. In the 4th study, 4 ruminally  fistulated cows were used in a switch back experiment to determine the effects of  feeding inoculated alfalfa on total tract nutrient utilization. In the last study,  27 Holstein cows in early lactation were used in a randomized complete block design  to determine the effects of feeding inoculated alfalfa on intake, milk yield, and  milk composition.</description><creator>Rizk, Charbel</creator><contributor>Mustafa, A.

Previous  investigations have found the composition of the inflammatory substrate in effusions  of allergy-associated otitis media to be is similar to the late-phase allergic  response seen elsewhere in the respiratory tract, such as in asthma and in allergic  rhinitis. In addition, there is evidence suggesting that diseases of the upper and  lower airways may represent different clinical manifestations of a single  inflammatory airway syndrome, or the United Airway Concept. The objective of this  research is to determine if the middle ear compartment may be a component of the  United Airways in allergic disease. Middle ear fluid, torus tubaris (Eustachian tube  mucosa at the nasopharyngeal orifice) and adenoidal tissue biopsies were obtained  from 45 patients undergoing simultaneous tympanostomy tube placement for OME and  adenoidectomy for adenoid hypertrophy. The cellular and cytokine profiles of each  site were investigated using immunocytochemistry (elastase, CD3, MBP) and in-situ  hybridization (IL-4, IL-5, IFN-gamma mRNA). Atopic status was determined for each  patient using skin-prick testing. Eleven of the 45 patients with OME (24%) were  atopic. The MEE of atopics had significantly higher levels of eosinophils, T  lymphocytes, IL-4 and IL-5 mRNA +cells (p &lt; 0.01), and significantly lower  levels of neutrophils and IFN-gamma mRNA +cells (p &lt; 0.01) when compared to  non-atopics. The nasopharyngeal tissue biopsies also revealed similar cellular and  cytokine profiles. Therefore, the allergic inflammation in atopic patients with OME  occurs on both sides of the Eustachian tube, both in the middle ear and in the  nasopharynx. The results of this study support the concept that the middle ear may  be part of the United Airway in atopic individuals.</description><creator>Nguyen, Ha-Nam Phan, 1975-</creator><contributor>Hamid, Qutayba (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Audiology.</subject><title>Evidence linking allergic otitis media with effusion to the United airways concept</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nz8060330.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rn301196k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Otolaryngology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g732d960x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We investigate a particular type of geometry, namely median  metric spaces.

Previous  investigations had suggested that signaling from the overexpressed beta 2ARs was  dampened in the atria of TG4 mice. Regulators of G-protein Signaling (RGSs) are a  family of negative regulators of G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) signaling that  are frequently induced by GPCR stimulation. Using an RT-PCR based strategy, we have  identified RGS5 as being a candidate RGS that is up-regulated in the atria of TG4  mice. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that RGS5 levels are 2--3 fold higher in  the atria of TG4 mice when compared to their non-transgenic littermates. To further  characterize RGS5 expression, we generated an RGS5 specific anti-serum. Results  indicate that RGS5 is a housekeeping RGS in the heart and in skeletal muscle but its  betaAR mediated induction in the atria suggests that it also has a highly  specialized function.</description><creator>Li, Xiao Yu, 1973-</creator><contributor>Greenwood, Michael T.
