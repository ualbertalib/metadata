We model these changes by an intra-cortical interaction which can in turn be represented by a one-component (Ising-like) model for ocular dominance and a two-component (XY-like) model orientational selectivity. We study these systems numerically by Monte Carlo simulation and by solving Langevin equations. Both models give evidence of stripe, hexagonal, and paramagnetic phases.

In both years, atrazine was detected in higher levels in the groundwater of the loam field than of the sand field. Deethylatrazine was the only metabolite found in any significant quantity in soil in 1988 and in groundwater in 1989. Deisopropylatrazine was detected in groundwater at the beginning and at the end of the 1988 season and levels were similar in both fields. Metolach or was never detected in groundwater. GLEAMS predictions favourably compared to field results at the 0-20 cm depth in both years. Half-life, however, had to be reduced by half in 1989 since higher temperature had increased dissipation. GLEAMS has not predicted leaching past 20 cm in either field in 1988 and 1989. During a dry summer, such as 1988 and 1989, leaching is mostly due to macropore flow and desorption of residues, two processes which are difficult to predict with existing models.</description><creator>Masse, Lucie</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Herbicides -- Environmental aspects -- Qu√©bec (Province).</subject><subject>Atrazine.</subject><subject>Soils -- Leaching.</subject><title>The leaching of metolachlor, atrazine, and two atrazine metabolites in two corn fields in Quebec : a monitoring study and validation of Gleams model</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9593tw31h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x633f2452</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Agricultural Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8s45qb10w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The breeding biology and nest-site selection of American crows (Corvus brachrhynchos) was studied in 2 areas of aspen parkland habitat in Saskatchewan in 1987 and 1988. Overall, density of nests at St. Denis averaged twice that found at Elstow and clutches were initiated earlier at St. Denis than at Elstow. Clutch size and hatching success did not differ between years or areas, but in 1987, nests at St. Denis produced nearly twice as many young as at Elstow. Crows nested in willow, aspen, and other trees. Nest trees were larger than randomly-selected trees in both years and areas. At St. Denis, the area near active crow nests had, on average, more permanent wetlands, a greater proportion of pasture and wetland, and less area of cultivation than areas adjacent to random sites. At St. Denis, successful nests were closer to permanent water and had more permanent wetlands nearby than depredated nests, but discriminant function analysis could not correctly distinguish successful nests in either area. Selection of nest characteristics to evade predators does not appear to provide predictable advantages to breeding crows.</description><creator>Ignatiuk, Jordan B.

The unidirectional secretion of tTf by Sertoli cells was verified, in vivo, and it was shown that this protein is internalized by adluminal germ cells. It was further determined by Scatchard analysis that this internalization was mediated by high affinity transferrin binding sites on the surface of round spermatids, numbering 1453/cell and displaying a K$ sb{ rm d}$ = 0.6 $ times$ 10$ sp{-9}$ M. Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from adluminal germ cells, namely spermatocytes, round spermatids and elongating spermatids, indicated that these cells expressed Tf receptor mRNA and ferritin mRNA in levels inversely related to their stage of maturation. Finally it was determined that following binding and internalization in round spermatids, Tf became associated with the endosomal compartment and was recycled back to the cell surface. Diferric tTf binds to Tf receptor on the surface of adluminal germ cells, is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis and the apotTf-Tf receptor complex is recycled back to the cell surface where apotTf is released into the adlumenal fluid.</description><creator>Petrie, Robert G.</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Biology, Anatomy.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>Receptor-mediated endocytosis of testicular transferrin by germinal cells of the rat testis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mw22v658v.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1831cm183</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anatomy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g732db052</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Nine mutagen sensitive (mus) mutants of Aspergillus nidulans were analyzed for effects on recombination. These mus show increased sensitivity to various mutagens; several were UV-sensitive. The majority were sterile in homozygous crosses homozygous mus diploids were essential to test for mitotic recombination. Two distinct tests were used: intergenic recombination between colour mutations and their centromeres; and, intragenic recombination between two distinguishable adE alleles. Both hyper- and hypo-rec mus mutations were identified, with 15- to 20-fold differences between them. Three mutations musN, musO, and musQ had greatly elevated recombination frequencies. Only one, musL significantly reduced recombination but consequently increased malsegregation. Analysis of the genotype of ad$ sp{+}$ recombinants, from musN and musL diploids, revealed qualitative differences from mus$ sp{+}$. musN enhanced mitotic crossing over but not gene conversion; while musL reduced the frequency of simple convertants but increased that of complex homozygous ad$ sp{+}$ genotypes. Mitotic conversion and crossing over, generally associated with each other, were uniquely affected in such mus diploids.</description><creator>Zhao, Ping, 1955-</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Aspergillus -- Cytogenetics.</subject><subject>Mutation (Biology)</subject><title>Effects of mus mutations on mitotic recombination in Aspergillus nidulans</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s1784m908.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g732db052</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2514nm65w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Clonal cell lines were isolated from mammary gland tissue epithelial cell cultures of lactating cows. Early passage clonal bovine mammary epithelial cells (clone LMH17) gave rise to several established cell lines (MAC-T lines) after being cotransfected with plasmids containing the temperature sensitive mutant SV40 large T antigen gene (pBAPSV40TtsA58) and the bacterial phosphotransferase gene (pSV2-neo). Unlike other cell types which were transformed after being transfected with SV40, MAC-T cells maintained many characteristics of non-transformed cells: MAC-T cells were serum and anchorage dependent, showed contact inhibition, and were not tumorigenic in immunodeficient mice. However, Southern transfer analysis revealed an integrated SV40 gene and cells showed no senescence after 50 passages. These cells are morphologically indistinguishable from parental LMH17 cells and retain the typical morphology of mammary epithelial cells. Positive cytokeratin immunostaining and the absence of vimentin staining indicated that these cells were epithelial in origin. MAC-T cells grew rapidly on plastic substratum with a doubling time of approximately 17 hours and became differentiated when grown on floating collagen gels in the presence of prolactin. The differentiated phenotype was characterized to include (1) the ability to form secretory domes with a lumen from a pavement of columnar cells; (2) increased casein mRNA abundance; (3) increased alpha S and beta casein secretion; (4) increased number and size of casein secretory vesicles; and (5) increased lactose synthesis and secretion.</description><creator>Huynh, The Hung</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Cell lines.</subject><subject>Clone cells.</subject><subject>Lactation.</subject><subject>Epithelial cells.</subject><title>Establishment of bovine mammary epithelial cell lines : an in vitro model for lactation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/db78td287.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2514nm65w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Animal Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:w9505165x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The coastal fish community of Wemindji, eastern James Bay, was studied to describe seasonal utilization of the Maquatua River estuary and the adjacent coastal waters by marine and anadromous fishes. During summer, the estuarine fishes are numerically dominated by the fourhorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus quadricornis) and the slender eelblenny (Lumpenus fabricii), and also by juvenile cisco (Coregonus artedii) and whitefish (C. clupeaformis). In coastal waters, three marine species are abundant: the shorthorn sculpin (M. scorpius), the arctic sculpin (M. scorpioides) and the Greenland cod (Gadus ogac). Greenland cod were studied in the same period. During the summer, they principally occupied shallow coastal waters, characterized by a belt of eelgrass (Zostera marina). In winter, more cod were found in the estuary. This movement corresponds to sexual maturity; spawning occurs in April to June. Greenland cod life history variables differ from those of most arctic benthic fishes: they show rapid growth, high fecundity, low age at first maturity and high mortality.</description><creator>Morin, Bernard</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Codfish -- James Bay Region.</subject><subject>Fish populations -- James Bay Region.</subject><subject>Gadus -- James Bay Region.</subject><title>Description et distribution de la communaut√© de poissons √† Wemindji, Baie de James, et √©cologie de la morue du Groenland (Gadus ogac)</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pr76f465n.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w9505165x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Renewable Resources</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ww72bc81w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Food choices, food purchases and convenience food preparation by a group of mildly intellectually handicapped students are investigated. These students attend John Grant High School, in Lachine, Quebec, for continued academic intervention and vocational training. Results indicate most of these young adults make food choices based on a desire for good nutrition. There is a significant correlation (p $&lt;$ 0.05) between nutrition knowledge and choosing nutritious foods in this sample. Yet the knowledge needed to make sound food choices is insufficient, as is the knowledge of food marketing. Families are the major influence on food selection and preparation, but as a source of information are found to be lacking. At school, home economics contributed most to students' knowledge of foods. Students found food preparation instructions particularly difficult to follow; students who had repeatedly prepared foods had greater success in producing an acceptable outcome. For this population practice is needed in making optimal food choices, menu planning and food preparation.</description><creator>Meredith, Gaye</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Cookery for people with mental disabilities -- Case studies.</subject><subject>Youth with mental disabilities -- Nutrition.</subject><subject>Food preferences -- Case studies.</subject><title>Food selection and preparation by a group of mildly mentally handicapped students</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mw22v660w.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bc81w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Renewable Resources</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:44558f426</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis examines Canadian and Indonesian land use legislation to determine the extent to which each addresses, or could address, environmental concerns. It shows that both jurisdictions do presently provide some measure of protection, with Canadian planning statutes containing some express provisions while the protection under Indonesian law is more implicit. However, both jurisdictions could go further in this regard. A consideration of specific land use planning tools suggests that planning agencies could be given the power to require of a developer the submission of an environmental impact statement as part of the approval process. This would require modification of Canadian planning legislation and the adoption of a comprehensive planning statute by Indonesia, which could incorporate some aspects of the Canadian planning system.</description><creator>Maarif, Syamsul</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Urban and Regional Planning.</subject><subject>Political Science, Public Administration.</subject><title>Environmentally sound planning legislation in Canada and Indonesia</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zs25x964h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/44558f426</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z603qz63g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Birdsfoot Trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L. cv. Leo), is a perennial forage legume that has difficulty in establishing stands due to slow seedling growth, weed competition and herbicide sensitivity. The development of herbicide resistant cultivars would be of economic importance. Resistant lines were isolated after sequential selection at the callus, shoot and whole plant levels to the sulfonylurea (SU) herbicides Harmony (DPX-M6316, code name for methyl 3- ( ( ((4-methoxy-6-methyl-1,3,5,triazine-2-yl)amino) carbonyl) amino) sulfonyl-2-thiophenecarboxylate), or Classic (DPX-F6025, code name for 2(( (4-chloro-6-methoxypyrimidine-yl)amino carbonyl) aminosulfonyl)benzoic acid ethyl ester. In field and growth chamber tests the Harmony regenerant lines displayed an increased tolerance as compared to control plants from tissue culture, and from seed. Results of the evaluation of callus cultures of regenerated mutant lines signify stability of the resistance. Outcrossed seeds collected from field trials, and tested in vitro for herbicide resistance, indicate that the trait is heritable and that resistance may be due to reduced sensitivity of acetolactate synthase to SU inhibition. It is concluded that herbicide resistant birdsfoot trefoil cultivars can be isolated using in vitro selection.</description><creator>Pofelis, Shoshana</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Herbicide resistance.</subject><subject>Lotus corniculatus.</subject><title>The development of sulfonylurea herbicide resistant birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus) plants from in vitro selection /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kh04dq76x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z603qz63g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0c483k49r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A number of critics have observed that there is no tradition of women's writing in Russian. The writings of Lydia Chukovskaya, I. Grekova and Tatiana Tolstaya--the principle subjects of the present work--partially contradict this perception, and defy the restrictions imposed by ideological authoritarianism and of gender. All three writers describe aspects of the Soviet, and human, condition, in unique ways. Lydia Chukovskaya's fiction portrays women, paralyzed by the scope of the Stalinist terror, who attempt to survive with dignity and accept their individual responsibility. I. Grekova writes about single women who maintain their autonomy through a balance between their professional and domestic lives. Tatiana Tolstaya's characters inhabit an atmosphere of lyrical alienation from which there is no exit.

A brief history of religious education in Ontario helps explain the current situation. Because religion is foundational to human experience, religious education is vital. Various scholars are cited in support. Gabriel Moran is a major resource in developing religious education as an academic field. He helps teachers to teach religion itself rather than about religion. Stanley Hauerwas broadens religious education to include character development. His emphasis on the self-agency of the moral agent helps teachers to educate character. His use of narrative encourages teachers to be inclusive and non-judgmental. Religious education must change to accommodate pluralism. Yet it still has a valid place in the public school if it is multi-faith and inclusive, encouraging all students to be religious according to their own faith community.</description><creator>Pountney, Michael James</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Religion in the public schools -- Ontario</subject><subject>Religious education -- Ontario</subject><title>Religious education in a pluralistic society : suggested approaches based on the work of Gabriel Moran and Stanley Hauerwas</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3x816n65q.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8w32r6779</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Religion and Philosophy in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:dj52w595c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis analyzes the estimation procedures and policy implications of an underground economy. In completing this task, we reviewed the techniques developed by Gutmann, Ferge, Tanzi, and others. Further attention was also given to the estimation processes, such as the survey approaches, used by various governments. In analyzing the policy implications of an underground economy, we examined the effects of fiscal and monetary policy, the aggregate statistics, the exchange rate, and other equally important indicators. We concluded that the consequences of a large and growing submerged sector can be devastating to the economic variables. Finally, this paper attempts to examine the Canadian underground economy. However, since the studies performed on the Canadian underground economy are limited, the task of both reviewing the literature, and determining the Canadian policy implications was perplexing. We concluded that there is a definite need for further study of the Canadian hidden sector.</description><creator>Smith, Collin E.</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Informal sector (Economics) -- Canada</subject><subject>Informal sector (Economics)</subject><title>The underground economy : estimation techniques and policy implications</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1g05fc847.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dj52w595c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Economics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vh53ww94z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The sources, sinks, fluxes, spatial distributions, and temporal variations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in subarctic fen catchments as well as the temporal patterns of DOC in streams draining subarctic fen catchments in the region of Schefferville, Quebec were investigated. In June to August sampling, DOC concentrations averaged 17 mg/L in peat water, 2-16 m/L in stream water, 49-56 mg/L in canopy throughfall, 14-19 mg/L in understory throughfall, 122-187 mg/L in stemflow, 25-39 mg/L in lichen and moss mat water, and 35-42 mg/L in soil A horizon water. Precipitation and canopy and understory throughfall were all significant DOC sources with seasonal DOC fluxes to the forest floor of 0.1-0.4, 0.5-1.3, and 0.8-1.7 g DOC/m$ sp2$ of forest, respectively. The lichen and moss mats and the A soil horizon were also found to be DOC sources, whereas the B soil horizon was a DOC sink. The soil column was estimated to export 0.4-0.5 g DOC/m$ sp2$. Peat, also a DOC source, released 1.2-2.1 g DOC/m$ sp2$. DOC concentrations in streams draining ten fen catchments were found to be positively correlated with the percentage of fen area in the catchments.</description><creator>Koprivnjak, Jean-Fran√ßois</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Fens -- Qu√©bec (Province)</subject><subject>Soils -- Carbon content -- Qu√©bec (Province)</subject><subject>Carbon cycle (Biogeochemistry)</subject><title>Sources, sinks, and fluxes of dissolved organic carbon in subarctic fen catchments</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2b88qd30h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vh53ww94z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ww72bc825</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis considers Herman Melville's Moby-Dick as a textual strategy of possible, alternative models of reading, as well as a text in itself. I approach the text as a drama of interpretations and argue that the individual consciousnesses of different interpreters represent different interpretive strategies, and that these differences suggest distinct structures of community. This approach becomes more focussed in the discussion of Ahab and Ishmael as representatives of two contrasting interpretive possibilities, of "reading" the text as a "pasteboard mask" which conceals a stable identity and single "truth," versus "reading" the text of the "defaced" and hence indeterminate surface of changing "meanings." Each strategy implies a different way of conceiving "space" as the "place" where community is formed, and though critics frequently perceive the ending of Moby-Dick as a paradoxical conflict between these two visionary quests, I suggest that Ishmael's survival presents a possible resolution, where Moby Dick becomes the narrative of filling space with many narratives to create the text Moby-Dick.</description><creator>Jabalpurwala, Inez</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Melville, Herman, 1819-1891.

It offers an improved time complexity of O($a sp{n}$), as compared with O($n sp{2}$(a + 1)$ sp{n}$) in (1). There are two steps to solving a constraint network. In the first step, all values which can never appear as part of any solution are removed from the domain of their corresponding variable. Smart starting points are used to jump to a branch of the tree which is more likely to hold the path being sought. Then backtracking is used to find all sets of consistent variable/value labelings which describe the solutions. Dynamic variable swapping is used to rearrange the order in which variables are bound, so as to reduce the size of the search tree. The algorithm works efficiently with sparse and fully connected constraint networks.</description><creator>Levine, Jonathan P.

An important area of research within DDES is the performance evaluation of distributed simulation algorithms. We implement Time Warp on an iPSC/2 hypercube and we study the performance of this optimistic approach in the context of queueing networks. The main focus of our study is to determine how the service time means of the logical processes affect performance. We employ two different network topologies, mesh and distributed (ARPANET), and we experiment with a varying number of logical processes. Aggressive and lazy cancellation strategies are explored. As our results indicate, Time Warp achieves significant speedups when the relative difference of the service time means is not high. A small number of IPs and a high degree of asymmetry in the simulated topology have a negative impact on Time Warp's performance.</description><creator>Krivossidis, Nikos</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>On the performance of time warp</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kh04dq776.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wh246t159</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8g84mn336</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The dataflow model of computation offers a powerful alternative to the von Neumann based model for exploiting the fine-grain parallelism inherent in scientific computations. Under this model, a program is expressed in the form of a graph, where the data values are carried by tokens, moving on the arcs of the graph. A distinctive feature of dataflow computers is the absence of the conventional program counter. Instead, instruction execution is solely determined by the availability of data which provides ample instruction level fine-grain parallelism. A highly pipelined static dataflow architecture has recently been proposed, based on the argument fetching principle, yielding the McGill Dataflow Architecture (MDFA). In this thesis, an inter-processor communication mechanism is proposed. With this mechanism, a multiprocessor MDFA system can be constructed, based on a distributed memory organization. An efficient inter-processor synchronization and communication support is presented, for sending and receiving data through an interconnection network. An Interprocessor Communication Unit (ICU) has been designed to implement the above mechanism in the MDFA. A simulation testbed has been implemented to study the performance of the multiprocessor. It includes an assembler, with multiprocessor extensions, and a multiprocessor simulator. An analysis based on the simulations results is presented, focusing on the impact of long latency operations on program performance.</description><creator>Monti, Jean-Marc</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Interprocessor communication supports for a multiprocessor dataflow machine</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h415pb54d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8g84mn336</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ng451j694</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>To increase the survival time of the liposome-based artificial red blood cells in vivo, bovine hemoglobin-loaded liposomes (LEHb) are coated with a polyanionic polymer. The purpose is to simulate the presence of a protective negative charge on the surface of living cells arising from the carboxylic extremities of sialoglycoproteins. In order to predict the in vivo response, the necessary experiments for the in vitro system characterization have been carried out. The purified LEHbs display a unimodal size distribution in the submicron range. Analysis of the lipid/Hb content of the liposomes reveals that the variations in the Hb encapsulation efficiency (E$ sb{ rm Hb}$) as a function of the initial Hb concentration (Hb) $ sb{ rm o}$ are insignificant compared to the net augmentation of E$ sb{ rm Hb}$ as a function of the increasing initial lipid concentration. Meanwhile high (Hb) $ sb{ rm o}$s are necessary for the preservation of oxyhemoglobin. A comparative study suggests that FT-IR spectroscopy gives a more accurate quantitative adsorption index while the chitinase-based enzymatic assay should be used as a qualitative detection tool.</description><creator>Mobed, Maryam</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Purification and characterization of carboxymethylchitin-coated liposomes encapsulating hemoglobin as potential blood substitutes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zg64tn18m.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ng451j694</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h989r422v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Many specialized processor boards have been developed to reduce the computation time of image processing algorithms. However, floating point processing required by complex algorithms has to be performed on general purpose computers since no specialized processor operates in floating point arithmetic. This thesis presents the VLSI design of a systolic cell to be used in a double precision floating point convolution processor. The CMOS technology was used to implement the design of the custom VLSI chip. Data flows in the systolic array in such a way that it is not only used when input but resued by every systolic cell in a pipelined fashion. This parallel processing approach reduces the computation time required by current workstations by three orders of magnitude while providing the same precision.</description><creator>Larochelle, Francis</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>VLSI design of a double precision floating point convolution systolic cell</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4f16c391x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h989r422v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:j098zc248</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Elie Wiesel's work has its roots in the concentrationary universe. Wiesel, the survivor, has committed himself to the role of witness. This thesis attempts to clarify the uncertain position of what could be called the "literature of testimony" considered midway between on the one hand, a formal literature, which tends to be out of touch with its "subject", and on the other hand, the writing of "reportage" and history. The study is divided into three chapters. In the first one we will examine the act of bearing witness and the act of writing. In the second chapter, we will analyse the components of bearing witness in Elie Wiesel's writings regarding to the enunciation and commitment, the pragmatic aspect and the difference between bearing witness and reporting. Finally, the narrative La Nuit will be at the centre of our analysis of Wiesel's work.</description><creator>Mizrahi, Yvette</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Holocaust, Jewish (1939-1945)</subject><subject>Wiesel, Elie, 1928-</subject><title>Elie Wiesel et la litt√©rature de t√©moignage</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4b29b735j.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j098zc248</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>D√©partement de langue et litt√©rature fran√ßaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4j03d100x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Microcomputer technology and the provision of alternative data entry devices offers numerous opportunities for physically disabled individuals to integrate into work and school settings. For therapists specializing in adapted access one of the main challenges involves prescribing and customizing suitable input devices since objective procedures to facilitate this process are lacking. The two papers presented in this thesis aimed to respond to this limitation. In the first paper the adapted access process was viewed within the context of a human factors model. A critical review of the literature relating specific human factors criteria (e.g. digit loading) to ergonomic solutions (e.g. input/output efficiency) substantiated clinical approaches to adapted device prescription and customization. Two case studies were used to illustrate the application of this approach to physically disabled individuals. The second paper investigated therapists' abilities to judge the mechanical characteristics of switches. Objective data characterizing the activation force-displacement trajectories for eight commonly used adapted switches were collected and compared to clinicians' subjective evaluation of the same characteristics. The major finding was that although therapists' subjective estimates of activation force and displacement were reasonably good there were specific areas of weakness that should be rectified with quantitative, objective data. It is anticipated that these two papers will enhance the application of microcomputer usage for physically disabled individuals.</description><creator>August, Sharon.</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Occupational Health and Safety.</subject><title>An objective approach to adapted input device prescription and customization /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rv042v07g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d100x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Physical and Occupational Therapy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qv33rx84k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Bacteriophage D3112 is a Mu-like transposable bacteriophage of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. D3112 phage has a double-stranded DNA genome of approximately 38 kb with a genetic organization similar to that of coliphages Mu and D108. Cloning and DNA sequencing of the D3112cts15 left end has revealed a unique large open reading frame spanning nucleotides 892 to 170 of the lower strand. A polypeptide of an apparent molecular weight of 19.6 kDa was visualized by SDS-PAGE when this ORF was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. By an in vivo functional assay, it was shown that the presence of 1174 bp of the D3112 left end on an E. coli-P. aeruginosa shuttle vector in P. aeruginosa prevented lytic development of superinfecting D3112 phage, indicating that the cloned fragment encodes the D3112 (c) repressor. By an in vitro functional assay, it was shown that a crude extract, containing overexpressed repressor (c), appeared to bind specifically to a 277 bp fragment of the D3112 left end. This fragment was also bound specifically by purified E. coli IHF protein. These protein-DNA interactions, and their location, suggest a role in transcription and regulation of the repressor (c) gene for this fragment. Preliminary purification steps of the D3112 repressor (c) show no interaction with weak ion exchange and precipitation by 60% (w/v) ammonium sulfate.</description><creator>Wragg-L√©gar√©, St√©phanie</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Biology, Microbiology.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Characterization of the regulatory region of the Mu-like Pseudomonas aeruginosa transposable phage D3112</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4x51hk30g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qv33rx84k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3j333336f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Complications resulting in flap failure and tissue necrosis constitute a serious and frequent problem to the plastic surgeon. Oxygen derived free radicals have been implicated in a variety of pathological processes including the ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) occurring in skin flaps. Previous work with experimental rat skin flaps has suggested that the xanthine oxidase (XO) enzymatic system may be the major source for these toxic radicals. Before the clinician and the patient can benefit from these experimental findings an animal model which closer resembles the clinical setting needs to be tested. In the laboratory I examined the role of XO and its potent inhibitor allopurinol in the IRI of skin and myocutaneous flaps. I have found negligible levels of XO enzyme in pig and human skin when compared to the rat. I have also found that no beneficial effect on survival could be observed by treating the flaps with several different dose regimens of allopurinol. Based on my results I conclude that it is unlikely that xanthine oxidase is of major importance in the IRI of skin flaps.</description><creator>Picard-Ami, Luis A.

The entire reorganized cortical region was driven by substitute cutaneous inputs at 3 weeks after spinal cord transection. This level of cortical responsiveness remained the same throughout the other two time periods studied. Also, throughout the 9 weeks studied, the majority of the substitute inputs came from the trunk. A smaller percentage of the substitute inputs arose from the shoulder girdle and the forelimb region.
