The article thickness is increased and decreased by opening and closing the gap of the annular die from which the parison is extruded. The die gap is regulated according to a gap-time profile which an operator determines during start up by trial and error. An optical sensor has been developed which can measure the thickness profile of the parison on-line just prior to its enclosure in the mould. The device will help operators to program the gap-time profile for optimum use of plastic by providing rapid feedback on the formation of the parison. It also represents an important step toward the development of closed loop control for container thickness distribution. The device determines thickness by striking the parison at an angle with a laser beam and measuring the separation between the beams that reflect from the outer and inner surfaces of the parison wall. A prototype was built and tested. The prototype uses three lasers at different angles and can make up to 250 point measurements during a one second scan. A personal computer uses specially developed software to reconstruct the profile of the parison wall from the raw data with an accuracy of $ pm$5%.</description><creator>Swan, Philip</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Engineering, Industrial.</subject><title>Development of an optical technique for on-line measurement of the thickness distribution of blow moulding parisons</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tt44pp02k.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gb19f705k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fn107014d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:55:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In Islamic societies, religion plays a significant role in shaping the home and the environment. An important feature of the Islamic culture is the segregation of women from males other than next of kin. This aspect has given rise to the separation of domains for men and women, both in the home and the neighbourhood. And this duality of space in turn reinforces the seclusion and segregation of women. This thesis studies this phenomenon in rural settlements in South Asia in regions where Muslims predominate and also in non-Muslim areas influenced by centuries of Muslim rule. The living patterns of rural women and how they use and perceive their local space formed the focus of the study. A field study was undertaken in a rural community in Bangladesh. Gender segregation norms and the resulting spatial organization of dwellings of different socio-economic groups were studied and compared. An important premise of the study is how the poor manage to integrate their faith and Islamic customs in their living environment.</description><creator>Chowdhury, Tasneem A., 1954-</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Housing, Rural -- South Asia.</subject><subject>Housing, Rural -- Bangladesh</subject><subject>Muslim women -- South Asia -- Economic conditions.</subject><subject>Muslim women -- South Asia -- Social conditions.</subject><title>Segregation of women in Islamic societies of South Asia and its reflection in rural housing : case study in Bangladesh</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jm214q226.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fn107014d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k643b227c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:55:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A computer vision system which tracks and analyses living cells and their offspring from sequential two-dimensional images is described. The cells are segmented using a method which combines global thresholding, component labeling and noise filtering. The shapes of the cells are then analyzed using a fast skeleton algorithm, and the states of the cells are determined as the cells change shape and move. This vision system recognizes the occurrence of cell mitosis and then tracks the offspring by evaluating the overall cell shape and position to determine the cell state. Both the cell shape and cell state are represented as fuzzy sets. The cell state takes into account previous shape and state knowledge as the mitotic process is described by a specific series of shape changes. This Mitosis Recognition System (MRS) has been developed for cell physiology research in the study of cell locomotory characteristics evolving over several generations.</description><creator>Wheeler, Kim M.

Two standardized depression inventories (CDI, DEQ) were used to classify the adolescents. The two groups were matched on age, sex and intelligence. The adolescents performed a forced-choice reaction time task designed to isolate several sources of interference in visual selective attention. Interference conditions varied with regard to number and type of distractors surrounding the target stimulus. Reaction times of the two groups were compared to identify differences in capacities and strategies utilized in filtering distracting information. Findings were examined with regard to the ability to select relevant information and ignore distracting information from the environment. Data analyses indicated that the reaction times of the adolescents who scored high on the depression scales were slower and more variable. In addition, facilitation occurred only with adolescents with low scores when the number of distractors exceeded visual capacities. The implications for understanding attentional capacities and strategies of adolescents with depressive symptoms are discussed.</description><creator>Djokovic-Ducic, Slobodanka</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Selectivity (Psychology)</subject><title>Selective attention in adolescents with and without depressive symptoms</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4q77fs49q.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94hq832</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9g54xj79g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:55:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>How well founded are accusations of racism against Quebec nationalist? No research has been done on this question regarding contemporary Quebec. Authors who have examined the link between nationalism and racism in other contexts have disagreed about its relevance. To provide an answer, a broad and flexible definition of the concept of racism is required. This thesis analyses the content of the Parti Quebecois' political discourse concerning minority communities as reported in newspapers between 1981 to 1990. An original aspect of this research is the fact is submits its results to representatives of the Parti Quebecois and minority communities to shed different lights on the author's interpretation of his results. The research supports the conclusion that the Parti Quebecois' discourse from 1981 to 1990 was not racist. As a result, a direct link between nationalism and racism cannot be established.</description><creator>Desrosiers, Eric K.</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Parti québécois</subject><subject>Québec (Province) -- Politics and government -- 1976-1985</subject><subject>Québec (Province) -- Politics and government -- 1985-1994</subject><title>Nationalisme et racisme : analyse de dix ans de discours du Parti Québécois à l'égard des communautés minoritaires du Québec (1981- 1990)</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s7526d57q.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9g54xj79g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:dj52w5918</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:55:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis examines the formative years (1931-1940) of Canada's first birth control clinic, the Birth Control Society of Hamilton (BCSH). The focus of this work is to place the activities of the BCSH in an international and national context. Canada's first birth control clinic drew directly on the writings and experience of two well known birth control pioneers, the American Margaret Sanger and the English woman Marie Stopes. This reliance on foreign models demonstrates the enormous influence that the British and Americans had on the formation of Canadian social and medical institutions. This thesis also challenges the traditional perception of the BCSH as a low key and non-ideological endeavour. New historical evidence indicates that the BCSH shared in the eugenic ideology of other contemporary Canadian birth control organizations and was an active participant in the debates surrounding contraception and eugenics.</description><creator>Annau, Catherine</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Birth Control Society of Hamilton</subject><subject>Birth control -- Ontario -- Hamilton -- History</subject><title>Canada's first birth control clinic : the Birth Control Society of Hamilton, 1931-1940</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2f75r892j.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dj52w5918</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9k41zf600</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:55:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this study was to establish the reliability and validity of the Power Master isokinetic ergometer in measuring skating power for 34 hockey players (14 professional, 11 recreational, and 9 female university players).

The first system consists of four reservoirs in series, the second corresponds to that of the Ste Maurice river. The solution method is based on the discrete maximum principle. Gradient method is used for the solution of the two-point boundary value problem. Two algorithms are suggested for dealing with difficulties posed by the state variable constraints. The first uses the augmented lagrangian method, the second is iterative. Both algorithms give a satisfactory solution for the problem. However, the first requires more memory space than the second but converges more rapidly. The second algorithm has the advantage of executing an iteration in less CPU time.

Interferon gamma (IFN-$ gamma$) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) were each shown to endow murine Kupffer cells with significant amoebicidal activity. Interferon gamma alone was not able to activate Kupffer cells to amoebicidal state. However, IFN-$ gamma$ and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) acted synergistically in this phenomenon. It seems that the acquisition of amoebicidal activity is associated with the involvement of hydrogen peroxide, because the addition of catalase partially decreases the killing of this parasite by Kupffer cells. In addition, it appears that the amoebicidal activity of IFN-$ gamma$-treated Kupffer cells is contact-dependent. In our study, Kupffer cells were also shown to be activated by TNF in vitro to an amoebicidal state and this cytolytic effect depends upon the ratio of Kupffer cells to amoebae, the concentrations of TNF used, and the time of exposure of the cells and the parasites to TNF. Our results indicate that the immunologic production of IFN-$ gamma$ and TNF is important in the activation of Kupffer cells for controlling this parasite and that Kupffer cells are strong effector cells against the amoebae.</description><creator>Salimi-Ghezelbash, Afsar.</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><title>In vitro effect of recombinant interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha on killing of entamoeba histolytica trophozoites by murine macrophages</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b2773w85c.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dn39x248h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physiology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9k41zf618</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:55:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>An off-line method of tuning PID controllers used in process control applications is presented. The plant under consideration is of second order with delay and the loop is presumed to be operating at steady state under the influence of random disturbances. Tuning is performed by minimizing the cost function, namely the integral of squared error, with respect to the tuning parameters. To do this, a second order approximation of the cost function is obtained and minimized using the Newton-Raphson method. System identification is done without interrupting production by introducing test signals of low signal to noise ratio and using a Kalman filter to extract the response. The result is a model composed of Laguerre functions which emulates the frequency response of the system in question. The integral term is found to cause stability problems if left unconstrained because the lag it introduces is not beneficial in the case under consideration. On the other hand, the algorithm behaves well when tuning a PD controller if the Kalman filter yields accurate results because the model obtained is then very similar to the transfer function of interest. The Kalman filter presently used does not adequately model the noise, so its performance hampers proper tuning of the loop.</description><creator>Gaber, Mark Rawi</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Off-line tuning of PID controllers for systems subjected to random disturbances</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qr46r2159.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9k41zf618</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p2676w75w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:55:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>InP obtained by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy, with properties similar to GaAs, shows mobilities approaching the theoretical maxima at low temperatures. However, the corresponding values remain abnormally low at room temperature where a pronounced electronic excitation to the conduction band is observed simultaneously. This reduction of the mobility is attributed to the presence of deep centers that are electrically inactive at low temperatures but become excited when the temperature increases. A model based on an iterative solution to the Boltzmann equation and accounting for the usual scattering mechanisms, including inelastic interactions, is able to explain the data perfectly and shows that a very high mobility at low temperature is not a sufficient measure of the purity for this material. The binding energy of the deep centers depends on the organo-metalic source used for the growth. This links the solution of this problem to the purification of the chemicals. Depletion effects at the interfaces did not appear to be significant.

The effects of mechanically induced stress (MIS) (shaking stress) were evaluated on early establishment of greenhouse-grown 'Q.E.' and 'D.K.' rose cuttings and the ex vitro survival and hardiness of micropropagated 'Q.E.' plantlets. Shaking 'Q.E.' rose cuttings at 200 rpm for 30 min daily for 4 weeks during the rooting stage increased root length, dry weight and the root:shoot dry weight ratio. Similar shaking of 'D.K.' rose at 200 rpm for 15 min increased shoot fresh and dry weight and root length and dry weight. Prior to ex vitro acclimatization, plantlets shaken at 150 rpm for 15 min had reduced leaf dry weights. Those shaken at 200 rpm for 15 min had lower specific root water content but greater percent root dry matter. MIS was not directly implicated in improving ex vitro survival and hardiness of 'Q.E.' rose.

The deposits consist of disseminated gold-bearing arsenopyrite, and stibnite in stratabound lenses, in quartz-ankerite veins and breccias, and as disseminations in pyritiferous black shale and sandstone units. Scheelite is found as disseminated crystals and in veinlets in limestone. An excellent correlation of As with S and a negative correlation of Na with Sb and As in shales and sandstones in the Los Lirios mine suggest sulphidation of the ore fluid and leaching of Na during the mineralizing event. Microthermometric measurements performed on inclusions in quartz and scheelite point to a low temperature (160 to 190$ sp circ$C) and low to moderate salinity (0 to 10 Wt.% NaCl eq.) NaCl-dominated aqueous ore fluid. Abundant vapour-rich inclusions suggest boiling of the ore fluid. The Ixtahuacan deposits are interpreted to have formed at a low temperature probably at a depth of a few hundred metres from a fluid with intermediate pH and under relatively low $f rm O sb2$. A model is proposed in which a deep meteoric fluid heated by a felsic intrusion at depth was focused along faults into the nose of an anticline.

The initial atmosphere is specified to be statically, inertially and symmetrically stable for dry convection. By varying the distribution of environmental relative humidity, a moist basic state potentially stable for upright convection but unstable for slantwise convection was obtained. The conditional symmetric instability (CSI) is released by specifying an initial streamfunction impulse. The results show a typical slantwise convective circulation. A cloudband extends along the updraft of the CSI circulation. An energy budget analysis shows that the main source of perturbation kinetic energy comes from the vertical shear of the basic state flow, although the buoyancy term is important during the initial onset stage. It is also found that the CSI circulation induces both upright convective unstable layers and horizontal inertial unstable layers. Although the decay stage has already been reached at the end of simulation, a neutral state with zero moist potential vorticity was not achieved. Our results also show that a high vertical resolution is necessary for the simulation of moist symmetric instability.</description><creator>Huang, Jinhui, 1955-</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</subject><title>A numerical study of slantwise convection /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d217qq67z.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pg15bg12v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Meteorology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6h440t54g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:55:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Plasmid curing experiments showed that the Caprylate-Esterase (CE) gene of Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei (LLG) is located on the LLG chromosome rather than on a plasmid. The enzyme was purified and shown to be a monomer with an apparent Mr of 32,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The N-terminal end of the CE protein was microsequenced. A synthesized 29-mer oligonucleotide deduced from L. casei codon usage and the N-terminal peptide sequence was used as probe against an LLG genomic library. Library screening yielded one positive clone (pLLG1435) with an insert of 8 kb. Southern analysis of pLLG1435 showed that the oligonucleotide probe strongly hybridized with the 1.9 kb PstI/SphI fragment found within its insert. Th fragment was subcloned and its DNA sequence was determined and found to be closely related to the phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase II gene of Bacillus subtilis.

This thesis presents an algorithm to update this information in reaction to link failures. The proposed algorithm appears to perform its task without introducing a count to infinity problem. This thesis also presents a way to reduce the size of one of the most frequently sent messages. The size of this message can be reduced by up to 50% of its equivalent in the Tsuchiya approach. The algorithm was tested on a simulated networks consisting of 98 nodes representative of the ARPANET (1983).

These divergencies are, and have always been, regarded as inconveniences to overcome, particularily between the Civil and Common Law traditions, which present quite diverging points of view in the way the Law is thought. Today, one criterion of evaluating any harmonization of international legal norms is the extent to which the effort enhances certainty, a quality much appreciated in the field of international commercial contracts. In fact, today, there is a detectable effort on the international level to harmonize the laws, especially in relevance to international contracts, in order to provide a better environment for world trade. When we decided to go through this subject, we had in mind the importance of understanding this harmonization tendency on the international sphere. That may be the reason why we have tried, in this thesis, to expose the harmonization process adopted by some recent conventions. Our purpose was to prove that, even though differences and disparities may exist, as long as there is a uniform tendency toward social and cultural uniformity, one might predict that these divergencies would eventually even out. We see in this tendency an indication of the convergence of the Common and Civil Law toward the same destination: make this world a better place.</description><creator>Alem, Mohammed Y.</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Law.</subject><subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</subject><title>The applicable law to international commercial contracts : harmonization perspectives between civil and common law?</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sj1393024.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xw42n913m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mk61rj10w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:55:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The nutrient status of three Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) plantations in southwestern Quebec were studied through foliar analysis. At all locations low N and K and marginal Mg foliar concentrations were identified. Diagnostic fertilization resulted in significantly improved foliar K, N, Ca/K molar ratio and in some cases Mg. The foliage of the treated trees has an improved dark green colour as compared with the controls. From this research it is evident that nutrient deficiencies of N, and K in particular, are showing up in spruce stands in the areas where atmospheric pollution is relatively severe. The use of foliar nutrient concentrations along with evaluation of visual decline symptoms give the best results in assessment of the trees' current nutrient status. Proper diagnostic fertilization, using KNO$ sb3$ and (K,Mg)SO$ sb4$, helped to correct the nutrient disturbances on the calcareous soils of the region, impoverished by former agricultural use. In these soils the balance of Ca with K and Mg is crucial for their proper uptake. The base cations addition enlarged the available P pool, as a result of the improved organic matter decomposition.

Three conceptually distinct categories form the theoretical framework of the study: (a) contending approaches to the study of international relations; (b) contending conceptions of economic growth and development; and (c) contending approaches to the aid policy-making process. The study examines the multiple objectives underlying Canada's aid programme, develops and interprets a series of "aid quality" indices, and undertakes a detailed examination of the aid policy process. Emphasis is placed on tracing the specific combination of domestic "push" and international "pull" factors which have pressured Ottawa into initiatives promoting a closer linkage of the aid and trade facets of government activity. Attention is also drawn to the impact of these initiatives on the developmental objectives of the programme. The principal finding of the study is that while Canada's aid programme has until recently been able to maintain a precarious balance between the opposing forces of philanthropy and self-interest, there are now unmistakable signs of a deliberate effort to tilt the programme in a more commercial direction. In this trend, the single case of Canada mirrors a more general pattern towards an increasingly commercial orientation in most donor aid programmes.</description><creator>Gillies, David, 1952-</creator><date>1986</date><subject>International economic relations</subject><subject>Economic assistance, Canadian</subject><title>Commerce over conscience : Canada's foreign aid programme in the 1980s</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v979v407h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dn39x250j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):22375</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
