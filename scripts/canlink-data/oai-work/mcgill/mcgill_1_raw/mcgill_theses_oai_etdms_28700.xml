It is argued that the central factor in the rise of islamically-oriented opposition to the elite order has been the gradual emergence in Egypt of the distinctively modern form of the nation-state. Specifically, the processes of Egyptian State formation are seen as responsible not only for the creation of conditions conducive to oppositional Islamism, but for engendering notions of national community and historical transformation which, through the processes of discursive transmutation, have provided the core of political sentiment undergirding this particular form of dissent.</description><creator>Calvert, John</creator><contributor>Boullata, Issa J.

By comparing immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting analyses, I find that p57$ sp{ rm statin}$ in vivo associates with other cellular proteins with molecular masses of 45 kDa (p45) and 110 kDa (p110). The p45 statin-associated protein is a serine/threonine kinase. The specificity of the association of statin and p45 kinase is strongly supported by the fact that the kinase activity of p45 correlates both qualitatively and quantitatively with the amount of statin present in immunoprecipitates from cultured fibroblasts having different states of growth or from different subcellular fractions. In addition, the p45 kinase can phosphorylate statin in vitro, suggesting that statin may be one of the physiological substrates for the p45 kinase in vivo. The biochemical evidence indicates that p45 is not a member of the casein kinase II, cAMP-dependent kinase, calmodulin-dependent kinase, or protein kinase C families. The relationship of this kinase to other families is yet to be investigated. The p110 statin-associated protein reacts with antibodies specific for the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product, Rb. Also present in anti-Rb immunoprecipitates is 57 kDa protein which is recognized by anti-statin antibody (S44). Both p57 and p110 are co-precipitated from ($ sp{35}$S) -labelled quiescent cell extracts with either anti-Rb or anti-statin antibodies. However, in ($ sp{35}$S) -labelled extracts of growing cells, neither p110 nor p57 is present in S44-immunoprecipitates; and anti-Rb immunoprecipitates contain several protein species, the phosphorylated forms of Rb (112-116 kDa), but not p57. Comparisons of V8 digests indicate that p110 in S44-immunoprecipitates is Rb, and p57 in anti-Rb immunoprecipitates is statin. Confocal microscopical analysis shows that statin and Rb are colocalized within fibroblasts, predominantly in the nuclear envelope and matrix regions. These results strongly suggest that statin also associates with unphosphorylated species of Rb in the nuclei of nonproliferative cells. Finally, the kinetics of statin expression in two states of cellular growth arrest, i.e. in young quiescent and in in vitro aged fibroblasts, was examined. I found that 95% of serum-starved cells express statin, independent of their in vitro age. After the addition of serum, the majority of senescent cells (CPDL $&gt;$ 50) persistently express statin, whereas young cells (CPDL $&lt;$ 20) lose statin after feeding. I also directly demonstrated that statin expression and DNA synthesis cannot occur simultaneously in the same cell. Furthermore, one additional nuclear protein possessing a common antigenic epitope to p57$ sp{ rm statin}$, with a molecular mass of 80 kDa, is detected only in senescent cells, but not in their young quiescent counterparts. Analysis of peptide maps indicates that this 80 kDa protein is different from p57$ sp{ rm statin}$. This finding implies that this unidentified 80 kDa protein may be a protein marker specific for senescent cells.</description><creator>Lee, Menq-Jer</creator><contributor>Wang, Eugenia (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>Biochemical characterization of statin, a protein marker specific fofor nonproliferating cells, and identification of its associated proteins in cultured human diploid fibroblasts</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v979v456f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qz20sv30q</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anatomy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gb19f749n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:07:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The liver is a major site of production of circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs). We have used primary cultured rat hepatocytes maintained under serum free conditions to explore the regulatory role of various hormones on hepatic IGF-I and IGFBP-1 mRNA levels. IGF-I mRNA levels were stimulated 2.0 to 2.5 fold by bovine growth hormone (bGH) and 1.8 to 2.0 fold by glucagon but on combining bGH and glucagon, a synergistic effect was observed and IGF-I mRNA level was augmented 10 to 12 fold. Octreotide blocked the hGH induced stimulation of IGF-I production in serum and hepatic IGF-I mRNA levels in hypophysectomized rats. This effect could have been partly due to the low levels of glucagon in serum when hypophysectomized rats were treated with hGH and octreotide. Octreotide was also found to inhibit GH stimulated IGF-I mRNA levels in rat hepatocytes. The unique synergy observed with glucagon and bGH on IGF-I mRNA levels in hepatocytes was not reproduced by T$ sb3$, oPRL, dexamethasone, EGF or insulin when each was added in combination with bGH or glucagon. Like glucagon, the addition of IBMX or (Bu)$ sb2$cAMP stimulated IGF-I mRNA levels 1.8 to 2.0 fold, but in the presence of bGH, IGF-I mRNA levels were stimulated 10 to 12 fold. PMA stimulated IGF-I mRNA levels 1.2 to 1.4 fold but displayed no synergism when added with bGH. The stimulatory effect of bGH plus glucagon on IGF-I mRNA levels was inhibited in PKC depleted cells, in the presence of inhibitors of PKC and in the presence of cycloheximide. bGH had no posttranscriptional effect on IGF-I mRNA stability whereas glucagon or (Bu)$ sb2$cAMP stabilized IGF-I mRNA at a posttranscriptional level. In summary, the major hormonal regulators of hepatic IGF-I mRNA levels appear to be GH and glucagon. Hepatic IGF-I mRNA levels are regulated by pathways involving protein kinase C and, protein kinase A as well as by synthesis of one or more protein(s). Glucagon and dexamethasone each stimulated IGFBP-1 mRNA levels 3 to 4 fold whereas bGH and T$ sb3$ each inhibited IGFBP-1 mRNA levels 45 to 70%. Insulin, which inhibited IGFBP-1 mRNA levels 95%, was the most powerful inhibitor and was also found to inhibit IGFBP-1 mRNA levels in the presence of dexamethasone. IBMX and (Bu)$ sb2$cAMP stimulated IGFBP-1 mRNA levels 6 to 8 fold whereas PMA inhibited IGFBP-1 mRNA levels 40 to 50%. The inhibitory effect of bGH on IGFBP-1 mRNA levels was abolished in PKC depleted cells and also in the presence of inhibitors of PKC. In the presence of cycloheximide, IGFBP-1 mRNA was superinduced by bGH. bGH had no posttranscriptional effect on IGFBP-1 mRNA whereas glucagon and (Bu)$ sb2$cAMP stabilized IGFBP-1 mRNA at a postranscriptional level. In summary, bGH, T$ sb3$ and insulin inhibited whereas dexamethasone and glucagon stimulated IGFBP-1 mRNA levels in hepatocytes. Effect of glucagon may be via elevation of cAMP levels, whereas the effect of bGH may be via activation of PKC levels. The inhibitory effect of bGH appears to require synthesis of one or more protein(s) besides stimulation of PKC levels.</description><creator>Kachra, Zarin</creator><contributor>Posner, Barry I.

Since the time that the GVH reaction was first described the mechanisms underlying the development of the disease have not been characterized. We have examined the state of M$ phi$ activation in nonirradiated B6AF1 mice injected with either 60 $ times$ 10$ sp6$ (acute GVHD) or 30 $ times$ 10$ sp6$ (nonlethal GVHD) parental B6 lymphoid cells. TNF-$ alpha$ and nitric oxide (NO) generation by M$ phi$ occurs following priming by IFN-$ gamma$ and triggering by LPS. During the early phase of acute GVHD, administration of normally sublethal amounts of LPS triggered release of significant amounts of TNF-$ alpha$ into the serum resulting in death of the animals within 36 hours. The amount of serum TNF-$ alpha$ produced following LPS injection increased during the course of GVHD and was significantly greater in acute GVH reactive mice. Normal animals treated with the same dose of LPS neither died nor produced detectable amounts of serum TNF-$ alpha$. In vitro studies demonstrated that M$ phi$ undergo priming for both TNF-$ alpha$ and NO production during the developing GVH reaction and that priming was greater during acute GVHD than nonlethal GVHD. As a result of M$ phi$ priming during acute GVHD, M$ phi$ mediated the selective release of iron from $ sp{59}$Fe,$ sp{51}$Cr dual-labelled target cells and expressed cytostatic activity when triggered by LPS. NO generation and cytostasis mediated by M$ phi$ from acute GVH-reactive animals were inhibited by NMMA. Endogenous bacterial-derived LPS was detected in the livers and spleens of acute GVH reactive animals and appeared subsequently the serum coincident with the onset of mortality. Immunohistochemical staining for TNF-$ alpha$ during acute GVHD demonstrated TNF-$ alpha$ in the splenic red pulp and liver, however, the hepatic portal infiltrates that characterize acute Our results demonstrate the entry of bacterial-derived LPS during the acute GVH reaction and that as a result of M$ phi$ priming, LPS in the transplant recipient acts as a trigger for TNF-$ alpha$ and NO production by M$ phi$. The presence of enteric Gram-negative bacteria is a risk factor for development of acute GVHD due to the triggering effect of LPS on M$ phi$ that are primed following bone marrow transplantation. The development of acute GVHD therefore involves the excessive priming of M$ phi$ followed by contact with LPS leading to the activation of NO and TNF-$ alpha$-mediated mechanisms of tissue injury, weight loss, septic shock and death of the transplant recipient.</description><creator>Nestel, Frederick P.

The observation of some degree of such labeling in virtually all cells in tissues of three animal species suggests that nucleoplasmic glycoproteins are a common cellular feature. To better define the distribution and nature of the putative labeled nucleoplasmic glycoproteins, cultured cells were used as a model cell type for both quantitative EM radioautographic and biochemical studies. After exposure to $ sp3$H-sugars, all three lines of cultured cells examined exhibited significant nucleoplasmic reaction in which the euchromatin, heterochromatin and nucleoli were all labeled to some extent. Studies on isolated, envelope-depleted nuclei from myeloma cells confirmed that the molecules in the nucleoplasm itself were the source of the radioautographic reaction observed over nuclei. Biochemical analyses of fractions of isolated nuclei indicated that much of the label resided in nuclear matrix glycoproteins of different molecular weights. Lectin binding studies on nuclear matrix fractions revealed the presence of galactose, fucose, and/or sialic acid residues in proteins. Glycosidase experiments indicated that some but not all of these glycoproteins had N-linked sidechains.</description><creator>Hemming, Richard John</creator><contributor>Bennett, Gary (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><subject>Biology, Anatomy.</subject><title>Radioautographical and biochemical studies on nucleoplasmic glycoproteins</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tt44pp45c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jd472z040</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anatomy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6969z2415</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:07:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study places the evolution of journalistic ethics in Quebec between 1960 and 1990 in its socio-political context. The thesis starts with a discussion of the philosophical and legal foundations that are the basis of journalistic activity. It then features a social history of Quebec journalism which allows an analysis of the various interacting factors that have influenced the ethical and deontological issues raised during that period. These factors develop along four main axes: socio-political and historical events, press organizations, the journalistic community, and professional practices. From this analysis, the author is able to draw a theory of displacements that is submitted as an interpretative model to explain the evolution of journalistic ethics in Quebec between 1960 and 1990. This theory shows that the main characteristics of this evolution lie in a series of progressive changes (1) in the levels of responsibility towards ethics, which engenders a general abandonment of such responsibilities; (2) in the definition of fundamental principles on which the press operates, namely freedom of the press, public right to information, and Social Responsibility, which is doubled by a relative failure of the self-regulation model of press ethics management; and (3) in many areas related to journalists' role and status, namely autonomy, adversary positions, social involvement, conflicts of interests and the definition of news itself.</description><creator>Saint-Jean, Armande, 1945-</creator><contributor>Robinson, G.

The mature PRL shared about 70% homology with mammalian PRLs and about 30% with fish PRLs. Areas of highest homology to other PRLs were located in the carboxyl terminus of the tPRL. Prolactin mRNA analyses, during the reproductive life of the turkey hen, confirmed that the high pituitary and plasma levels of PRL measured during the incubation phase are due to enhanced transcription of the PRL gene. Furthermore, tPRL mRNA levels were highly correlated with pituitary levels of tPRL. Recombinant tPRL (rctPRL), biologically and immunologically similar to pituitary tPRL, was purified from Escherichia coli cultures hosting an expression vector carrying the tPRL cDNA. Polyclonal antibodies raised against purified rctPRL behaved similar as antibodies raised against pituitary derived tPRL, in immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry experiments. Three tPRL isoforms (with estimated molecular weights of 27 kDa, 25 kDa and 24 kDa) were identified in turkey pituitary extracts. The relative proportion of the 27 kDa isoform increased while that of the 25 kDa decreased with increasing levels of total pituitary tPRL, during the reproductive life of the turkey hen. The partition of the immunoreactivity of tPRL into the three isoforms perhaps provides an additional control of the multitude functions of PRL.</description><creator>Karatzas, Constantinos N.</creator><contributor>Kuhnlein, V.

The great number of experiments done on binary alloys makes condensed matter physics very appealing since it allows theory and experiment to progress side by side. Using field theoretic methods, we study many aspects of physical systems such as binary alloys, which are taken out of thermodynamic equilibrium. In the introduction, an expose of basic notions is given. In the second chapter, we review an analytical method describing phase separation processes resulting from a critical quench. Physically, the latter phenomena could represent an initially disordered binary alloy, in which, following a drop in temperature, the atoms spontaneously order into a crystalline lattice. We will then study the effect a conserved field has on the kinetics of phase separation. This conserved field represents the local concentration of atoms of the alloy. In Chapter 4, we describe a theory formulated to explain some non-trivial relaxation of the structure factor seen experimentally for an initially ordered system suddenly cooled. Finally, we propose a theoretical model describing polymorphous crystallization. The model is studied via computer simulations. The results so obtained are compared to the experiment.</description><creator>Morin, Bertrand</creator><date>1993</date><subject>Physics, Condensed Matter.</subject><title>Kinetics of quenches</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/70795930n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fn107067f</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bc386k932</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:07:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation has explored the problem of a yawning gap between policy and the implementation of lay participation in health development activities in Ghana, using data from 577 households in 22 rural communities. A Health Systems model has been applied to data, to explain relationships and four sets of variables--household need for health services, predisposing attributes, participatory patterns, enabling factors--on household use of available health facilities and services. Overall, results indicate a complex interdependence of factors which influence modern health services use. A multiple regression procedure identifies the presence of children under 5 years, the household's perception of its influence in the community, household participation in community health-related activities, household socio-economic and educational levels, to be significantly related to services use.

Of 21 snail species collected from nine aquatic communities in southern Quebec and southeastern Ontario, May to October 1989 and 1990, only Bithynia tentaculata was heavily and consistently infected with C. bushiensis metacercariae. Although infection levels varied spatially, a consistent concave seasonal pattern of prevalence and abundance was found which may be due to overwintering metacercariae and the almost simultaneous onset of cercarial transmission and recruitment of new snails in mid-summer. Even though S. globulus metacercariae were found in 18 of 21 snail species, B. tentaculata is believed to contribute most to transmission to ducks. The variety of seasonal patterns and large scale spatial heterogeneity in the prevalence and abundance of S. globulus suggested that cercariae may be from more than one source. Some of the spatial variation in metacercarial levels may be due to small scale processes; extensive spatial heterogeneity at a scale of 10 m was detected in S. globulus cercarial transmission to sentinel snails. This small scale heterogeneity may be due to B. tentaculata having small home ranges as suggested by mark-recapture studies on movement. In aquaria, even though smaller B. tentaculata were more active than larger ones and intraspecific microhabitat preferences were found, preliminary results from ducks (Anas discors) feeding on snail communities in pools suggested that snails are ingested in proportion to their presence. Therefore, the importance of a snail species or size class in the transmission of the two parasites to ducks may depend only on its density and metacercarial abundance. Finally, another mode of transmission is proposed for S. globulus: ducks may become infected by consuming empty snail shells containing viable cysts.</description><creator>Lepitzki, Dwayne Allen William</creator><contributor>McLaughlin, J.

Some relevant optimizations are formulated in an H$ sp infty$ setting, and are shown to reduce to a 'two-disc' mixed sensitivity problem. Despite its basic nature, the two-disc problem has not previously been solved, although approximations to it have been proposed. It is shown, by means of examples, that such approximations may involve large errors, highlighting the need for an accurate theory. An accurate theory of the two-disc problem is achieved by expressing the two-disc problem as a distance minimization in a certain Banach space, and then applying Banach space duality methods to characterize the solutions. Dual and predual spaces are identified and equivalent maximizations formulated therein. Alignment conditions are obtained, which yield the conclusion that the optimal solution is 'allpass' in general and unique in the SISO case. The duality description of the problem leads naturally to a solution based on convex programming. In an extension of the theory to time-varying discrete-time systems, optimal robust disturbance rejection is shown to reduce to an operator form of the two-disc problem in the $l sp{2}$-induced norm topology. A predual description is obtained, and an existence result for optimal feedback is proved. In the case of time-invariant nominal plants subject to time-varying uncertainty, at least one optimal controller is shown to be time-invariant. Finally, complexity based notions of uncertainty are considered. The ability of feedback to reduce metric complexity is examined when applied either prior to, or after identification.</description><creator>Owen, James G.

Optimal loop scheduling is therefore one of the most important topics studied by many computer scientists. However how to allocate minimum number of registers to support optimal loop scheduling for parallel architectures is less understood. In this thesis, we propose a simultaneous scheduling and register allocation approach for a parallelizing compiler, which will find one among all the time-optimal periodic schedules that uses minimum amount of registers. We prove that the general problem of finding such an optimal scheduling together with register allocation is NP-complete. Then we propose a practical approach to divide the register allocation problem into two steps. The first step solves a minimum buffer allocation problem, which will find a time-optimal periodic schedule using minimum number of buffers. We give a polynomial time algorithm to solve this problem. The second step analyzes the live ranges of the variables and uses coloring algorithms to reduce the register requirements by sharing. The algorithm has been implemented and used to test selected loops on benchmark programs. Testing results are reported in this thesis. In order to allocate enough memory spaces to support optimal dynamic schedules, we propose a cycle balancing scheme that allocates buffers to the arcs of the dataflow graph representing a loop, so that it can allow a loop being scheduled dynamically to achieve maximum speedup. We show how to formulate the problem into an integer programming problem. Practical polynomial time solution algorithms are given.</description><creator>Ning, Qi</creator><date>1993</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Register allocation for optimal loop scheduling</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b2773x229.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bv73c2090</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sq87bw08b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:07:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>An accurate and fast technique has been developed for computing the supply current as well as the delay in CMOS combinational circuits. It is based on a new analytical model of the CMOS inverter which is designed specifically to compute the maximum supply current and the delay without recourse to integration. If the current waveform is needed, integration is used only for the trailing edge. This model can be used not only to compute maximum supply current and delay in CMOS circuits, but also to detect dynamic hazards. The extension to general CMOS circuits is achieved through a collapsing method which reduces each gate to an equivalent inverter. Unlike previous attempts to solve this problem, our technique is not limited to single input transitions or to step inputs. It also takes into account the relative positions of the switching inputs in series-connected transistors. The improvement in computation speed, for delay and maximum current in large circuits, approaches 4 orders of magnitude compared to HSPICE using the level-3 MOSFET model. For current waveforms the speed improvement approaches 3 orders of magnitude. The accuracy of computing the delay and the supply current is usually within 10% and 12%, respectively. Although the technique has been tested on static CMOS gate circuits, the extension to dynamic circuits is straightforward.</description><creator>Nabavi-Lishi, Abdolreza</creator><contributor>Rumin, Nicholas (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Delay and current evaluation in CMOS circuits</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hm50tt23p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sq87bw08b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qn59q562f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:07:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study examined the effects of time, gender, locus of control, and perceived controllability on the differential effectiveness of selected treatment approaches to the reduction of academic procrastination. A sample of 122 male and female college students was randomly assigned to one of three groups: behavioural, cognitive-behavioural, or study skills. Treatments were administered via self-instruction modules for five consecutive weeks. Three univariate analyses, one for each of the self-report measures of procrastination, examined the main effects and interactions of the independent variables. According to the findings the effects of gender, locus of control, and perceived controllability did not result in any differential effectiveness of treatment approaches. Male subjects reduced procrastination over time more than did female subjects. A significant portion of the between-subjects variance on measures of procrastination was accounted for by the pooled effects of locus of control and perceived controllability. Male subjects, depending upon their perceived locus of control and their level of perceived controllability, differentially reduced procrastination over time regardless of the treatment approach to which they were exposed. The need for counsellors to explore strategies to increase clients' beliefs that they can control and therefore change their own behaviour is addressed. Methodological concerns regarding aptitude-treatment interaction studies and recommendations for future research are discussed.</description><creator>Havel, Alice</creator><contributor>Dumont, F. R.

The investigation is carried out in four parts using the coupled sea ice-ocean model of Oberhuber (1993a). The Oberhuber model is the first global ocean general circulation model to use Lagrangian isopycnal coordinates. First, a sensitivity study is given of the sea-ice model, which is both dynamic and thermodynamic. The robustness of the sea-ice component in an uncoupled mode is demonstrated. Secondly, the addition of a snow model to the coupled sea ice-ocean model of Oberhuber (1993a) is described. The inclusion of snow is shown to be important for obtaining a good simulation of ice thickness in both the Arctic and Antarctic. Thirdly, the coupled ice-ocean model is used to investigate the general circulation of the Artic Ocean and its connection with the North Atlantic. The cyclonic motion of the Atlantic layer within the Arctic is correctly simulated.

In order to do this, the cell line U-937 was chosen because it possesses many characteristics of immature monocytes and can be easily infected by HIV-1. We found that long-term chronically-infected cells generate a high amount of defective particles, unable by themselves to successfully infect any target cells. Two main phenotypes were detected, one showing defectiveness in reverse transcriptase activity, and the other one showing inability to express fully mature glycoproteins. We also investigated the biological relevance of these defective particles, particularly in a situation where two cells generating defective virions are fused together by chemical methods. We show evidence that defective virions can complement each other in a hybrid cell and generate fully infectious particles resembling wild-type virus. Such a phenomenon may occur by genetic recombination, as suggested by Southern blot analysis. This finding may prove of clinical relevance since cells of phagocytic lineage can fuse in vivo naturally or by virus-mediated mechanisms. We next tried to assess the efficacy of the antiviral drug, AZT, in controlling HIV-1 replication in such monocyte-like cells. AZT was found unable to completely abolish HIV-1 replication in vitro but was able to delay in a dose-dependent fashion the expression of the virus. In addition, we also studied the effect of AZT in clonal derivatives of U-937 cells, and found that the inhibitory effect was proportional to the degree of susceptibility of these cells to the virus. Finally, we analyzed the susceptibility of U-937 cells by using such clonal derivatives and found that some displayed either high or low susceptibility to infection by HIV-1. The susceptibility which correlated with the amounts of intracellular viral DNA and TNF-alpha mRNA expression was found not to depend on levels of CD4 receptors, a result which suggests that other factors are involved in modulating replication in those cells.</description><creator>Boulerice, François</creator><contributor>Wainberg, Mark A.

Drying was found to consist in a constant rate period, followed by a falling rate period where the drying rate decreases linearly with moisture content. The relation found between the constant rate and Reynolds number and temperature of the jet is consistent with a previous correlation for air impingement heat transfer, suitably modified for conditions in a steam environment. For a given mass flux, steam drying is slower than air drying below an inversion temperature of 175$ sp circ$C and faster above. The specific blower power for steam drying is much lower than for air drying at temperatures in the industrial range. Equilibrium moisture content measurements showed that complete drying can be obtained at steam temperatures only slightly above the boiling point. Expressions for the critical moisture content in impingement drying in steam and in air were obtained. In steam drying, the falling rate period was found to be determined more by internal transport resistance than by adsorption of water on the fibers. A new arrangement for drying paper, in which the first half of the drying is done by a conventional dryer to which steam is supplied from a steam impingement dryer handling the second half, was analyzed. In regions with low electricity cost, recirculation of steam around the impingement dryer circuit by a mechanical fan is much more economical than by a thermocompressor. However, this advantage is only marginal where electricity cost is high. The overall performance is optimized by using the highest temperature and lowest jet velocity possible. The drying cycle proposed is a realistic and attractive means to increase drying capacity and reduce energy consumption.</description><creator>Bond, Jean-François</creator><contributor>Douglas, W. J.

Extensive studies in both human and murine systems defined a selective down-regulatory role for AFP on certain types of immune reactions in vitro. Direct evidence was obtained in experimental models of autoimmune disease showing that mouse and human AFP can, in a predictable fashion, influence in vivo immune parameters. However, attempts to define the molecular basis of the immunoregulatory functions of AFP have until now been handicapped by the lack of an appropriate consistent source for pure AFP in quantities suitable for detailed investigations. The aim of my thesis work was to generate such a source to elucidate structure-function relationships in AFP. Human and mouse AFP cDNAs were cloned and expressed at high-levels in Escherichia coli. In addition, we also overexpressed truncated versions of the mouse AFP gene that code for the first third and two third of the molecule. Optimum fractional abundance for an individual rAFP protein had to be determined empirically and was found to be influenced by several parameters including the expression vector, the bacterial strain, as well as by the induction and harvesting protocols. It was determined that rAFPs were largely present as insoluble aggregates involving intermolecular disulphide bonds. We devised very specific procedures to recover pure and soluble forms of rAFP proteins produced in certain preselected Escherichia coli strains.</description><creator>Boismenu, Richard</creator><contributor>Mursita, R.

Branches originating from the internal arterial circle anastomosed head to head with branches of the intercostal arteries (8$ sp{ rm th}$ to 13$ sp{ rm th}$ intercostal space) to form costophrenic arcades all along the muscular fibers of the crural and costal diaphragm. These anastomosis were found to be physiologically functional. Diaphragmatic circulation produced only by the intercostal arteries was able to sustain costal and crural contractility at the fatigue threshold (TTdi of 0.20). However, internal mammary artery perfusion was only able to maintain costal contractility. Left and right hemidiaphragmatic arterial communications (shunting) were inexistant during electrophrenic unilateral and bilateral stimulation. Diaphragmatic venous outflow was produced mostly by the intercostal veins (60% of total diaphragmatic venous outflow) which drained into the azygos trunk. The phrenic veins contributed 25% and the internal mammary veins contributed 15% of total diaphragmatic venous outflow. Diaphragmatic circulation was found to be proportional to the Pdi and was related to the duty cycle by a parabolic function with the highest flow rates being observed at a duty cycle of 0.50, regardless of the Pdi being generated.</description><creator>Comtois, Alain Steve</creator><contributor>Grassino, Alejandro (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1991</date><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><title>Structure and response of the diaphragmatic circulation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z603r004p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7d278v71r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physiology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n870zs36w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:07:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>La libéralisation de la règlementation du transport aérien international est la pierre angulaire d’une croissance soutenue pour le secteur.  Depuis les années 1990, la libéralisation a progressée à divers niveaux grâce à l’assouplissement des dispositions clés dans plus de 4000 accords bilatéraux de services actuellement en place au niveau mondial. En 2007, près de 30 pour cent du trafic circulant entre les États était régi par des dispositions libéralisées à différents degrés. Le caractère international du secteur de l’aviation a facilité la croissance rapide du commerce des biens et des services au cours des 50 dernières années. Pourtant, paradoxalement, ce secteur a les règles sur la propriété et le contrôle les plus restrictives. Ces restrictions anormales empêchent la liberté d’investir, considérée comme essentielle au fonctionnement du marché, et contribue à la promotion de politiques protectionnistes. En conséquence, l’industrie du transport aérien est devenu manifestement une curiosité dans un monde dominé par la libéralisation des échanges. La libéralisation a été bien acceptée et cultivée dans d’autres secteurs industriels et il y a eu une augmentation de l’activité dans les fusions et acquisitions dans le monde entier. Ailleurs, les investissements transnationaux et transfrontaliers ont augmenté de façon exponentielle.  La suppression des restrictions nationales dans l’industrie du transport aérien est la nécessité de l’heure.  La récente politique des Etats-Unis et de l’Union Européenne dite « ciel ouvert plus » et le succès de la deuxième étape des négociations qui ont permis la propriété étrangère des compagnies aériennes des États-Unis et de l’Union Européenne marquent le début d'une nouvelle ère dans la poursuite d’une libéralisation plus poussée de la propriété et des règles de contrôle.

In 2007, almost 30 per cent of the international traffic moved between States that have embraced liberalization.   The international character of the airline sector facilitated the rapid growth of trade in goods and services over the last sixty years. Yet, paradoxically, it has the most restrictive rules on ownership and control unlike other sectors. This anomalous restriction prevents freedom to invest, considered essential to the functioning of the market, and promotes protectionist policies. As a result, the airline industry has emerged as a conspicuous oddity in a world of widespread trade liberalization.    Liberalization has been well accepted and embraced in other industrial sectors and there is increased activity in international mergers and acquisitions across the globe. Trans-national and cross border investments have increased exponentially. Removal of national restrictions in airline industry is the need of the hour. The recent US-EU ‘open skies plus policy’ and the success of the ongoing second stage negotiations resulting in allowing of foreign ownership of the US and the EU airlines will usher in a new era of further liberalization of ownership and control rules.  This thesis seeks to discuss the policies and rationale behind archaic ownership and control requirements and the benefits flowing from a liberal approach. After recommending the opening up of cross border investments in the airline industry, this thesis proposes important steps to be taken to achieve prosperous results for the airline industry.</description><creator>Zaidi, Syed</creator><contributor>Fabien Gélinas (Internal/Supervisor)</contributor><date>2009</date><subject>Social Sciences - Law</subject><title>Breaking the shackles: foreign ownership and control in the airline industry</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/41687j93f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n870zs36w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:br86b4818</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:07:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Environ 4.4 millions de canadiens souffrent d’un handicap physique, par contre moins de 1% de ces individus prennent part à des programmes de sport organisé (Statistiques Canada, 2007). En utilisant le Self-Determination Theory (SDT) en tant que cadre, l'objectif de la présente étude était d'examiner la relation entre la perception du comportement de l'entraîneur par les athlètes paralympiques, la satisfaction des besoins psychologiques, et la motivation. Les participants sont 113 athlètes Paralympiques Canadiens. Ils ont complété un questionnaire en ligne, composé  de Sport Climate Questionnaire (Deci &amp; Ryan, 2006),  une mesure de la perception de l’autonomie (Hollembeak &amp; Amorose, 2005), des compétences (Hollembeak &amp; Amorose, 2005) et du sentiment d’appartenance (Richer &amp; Vallerand, 1998)  ainsi que le Sport Motivation Scale (Pelletier et al, 1995). La confirmation de l'analyse factorielle a été utilisée pour tester la validité factorielle de l'échelle. Le sentier de modélisation a été utilisé pour tester les relations entre la perception du comportement des entraineurs, les besoins psychologiques de base de la compétence, l'autonomie et la parenté, la motivation et le sport. L’appréciation de la voie modèle appuie les principes du traitement spécial et différencié et a confirmé la présence d'une relation entre l'autonomie de soutien, le comportement, la satisfaction des besoins, et la motivation. Il existe une relation significative entre le comportement des entraîneurs et deux des besoins (autonomie et appartenance). En autre, l'autonomie et la compétence sont en corrélation significative avec la motivation. Ces résultats ont des implications théoriques et pratiques puisqu’ils soulignent l’importance de l’autonomie et de l’utilisation de stratégies d’entraînements pour promouvoir la motivation chez les athlètes Paralympiques.</description><description>There are approximately 4.4 million Canadians (14%) with a physical disability, yet less than 1% of these individuals participate in organized sport programs (Sport Canada, 2006; Statistics Canada, 2007). Using Self-Determination Theory (SDT) as a framework, the purpose of the current study was to examine the relationship between Paralympic athletes’ perceptions of coach behaviour, psychological needs satisfaction, and motivation.  The participants in this study were 113 Canadian Paralympic athletes. Participants completed an online survey comprised of the Sport Climate Questionnaire (Deci &amp; Ryan, 2006), measures of perceived autonomy (Hollembeak &amp; Amorose, 2005), competence (Hollembeak &amp; Amorose, 2005), relatedness (Richer &amp; Vallerand, 1998) and the Sport Motivation Scale (Pelletier et al., 1995). Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the measurement model. Path modeling was used to test the relationships among perceptions of coach behaviour, the basic psychological needs of competence, autonomy, and relatedness, and motivation. Findings from the path model partially supported the tenets of SDT. There was a significant relationship between perceptions of coach behaviour and perceived autonomy and relatedness. Autonomy and competence were significant correlates of motivation. Results revealed the presence of a relationship between perceptions of autonomy supportive coaching strategies, the three psychological needs, and athletes’ intrinsic motivation towards sport. These findings hold theoretical and practical significance as they underscore the importance of using autonomy supportive coaching strategies to promote motivation in Paralympic athletes.</description><creator>Banack, Hailey</creator><contributor>Catherine Sabiston (Internal/Cosupervisor2)</contributor><contributor>Gordon Bloom (Internal/Supervisor)</contributor><date>2009</date><subject>Education - Psychology</subject><title>Coaching behaviours and the motivation of Paralympic athletes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4t64gp90p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/br86b4818</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4x51hk720</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:07:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The principle of non-discrimination is widely subscribed to in both Bilateral Investment Treaties and Investor-State arbitration awards.  However, when this principle is deconstructed, it appears to be less evident what it entails and accordingly, how it should be applied in practice.  This thesis examines how discriminatory treatment is defined under international investment law and seeks to articulate a more coherent test based upon the substantive standard of equality and the proportionality principle.  By examining a current Investor-State dispute against the Government of South Africa, it illustrates why it is important to understand the notion of equality, and that investment arbitrations are increasingly raising questions of the conflict between domestic public policy and investment protection for arbitrators to resolve.  Underlying this issue are wider questions relating to the fundamental power balances between the parties to Bilateral Investment Treaties.  In order to encourage international investment as a whole, these questions should not be ignored but rather addressed by arbitral tribunals.</description><description>Le principe de non-discrimination est très présent tant dans les traités bilatéraux d’investissement que dans les sentences arbitrales. Pourtant, l’analyse approfondie de ce principe révèle que sa signification réelle et, par voie de conséquence, son application pratique sont moins évidentes qu’il n’y paraît.  Cette thèse étudie la manière selon laquelle le traitement discriminatoire est défini en droit des investissements internationaux et cherche à élaborer un test plus cohérent fondé sur les principes d’égalité substantive et de proportionnalité.  En examinant un litige opposant actuellement un investisseur à un Etat, en l’occurrence le gouvernement d’Afrique du Sud, cette thèse souligne l’importance de la notion d’égalité. En outre, elle démontre que les arbitrages en matière d’investissement présentent un risque accru de conflits entre les politiques publiques des Etats et la protection des investisseurs, conflits qu’il revient aux arbitres de trancher. Cette question est peut-être révélatrice de problématique plus large concernant l’équilibre des pouvoirs entre les parties à un traité d’investissement bilatéral.</description><creator>Menezes, Antonia</creator><contributor>Frederic Bachand (Internal/Supervisor)</contributor><date>2009</date><subject>Social Sciences - Law</subject><title>Developing states' long walk to freedom: an examination of the principle of non-discrimination, substantive equality and proportionality in investor-state disputes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wd375x968.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hk720</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hq37vq104</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:07:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Earth observation satellites provide useful information for early warnings of coming disasters. Theoretically, Principle XI in the Principles Relating to Remote Sensing of the Earth from Outer Space posits that states having access to information about potential natural disasters should promptly transmit this data and its related information to states endangered by the disaster. This thesis analyzes the legal issues related to this duty, liability, remuneration, and the status of international organizations and private entities. It concludes that liability and remuneration issues are unclear. However, due to the time needed to finalize a legally-binding treaty, a United Nations resolution is the way to formulate the regime. Furthermore, the United Nations can promote cooperation between the have and have-not countries, not only in the legal context but also by raising awareness; promoting standardized, compatible data; and supporting the expense of providing remote sensing data to countries without satellites.</description><description>Les satellites d'observation de la terre fournissent des informations utiles pour détecter en avance les catastrophes éventuelles. Théoriquement, le principe XI, un des principes sur la télédétection, impose particulièrement que les états ayant accès aux informations sur des catastrophes naturelles potentielles devraient promptement transmettre ces données et son information relative aux états mis en danger par le désastre. Ce mémoire analyse les problématiques liées à ce devoir, à la responsabilité, à la rémunération, et au statut des organismes internationaux et des entités privées. Elle conclut que la responsabilité et la rémunération sont peu claires. Cependant, en raison du temps nécessaire pour conclure un traité juridiquement contraignant, une résolution des Nations Unies paraît comme la manière souhaitable pour formuler ce régime. En outre, les Nations Unies peuvent promouvoir la coopération entre les pays ayant les capacités technologiques et ceux qui ne l’ont pas, non seulement dans le contexte juridique mais également en soulevant la conscience ; en promouvant l’uniformisation et les données compatibles ; et en accordant des aides financières pour les dépenses à fournir des données de télédétection aux pays privés de satellites.</description><creator>Kovudhikulrungsri, Lalin</creator><contributor>Richard Gold (Internal/Supervisor)</contributor><date>2009</date><subject>Social Sciences - Law</subject><title>Legal issues - using earth observation satellite for pre-disaster management</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fj2363722.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hq37vq104</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):28725</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
