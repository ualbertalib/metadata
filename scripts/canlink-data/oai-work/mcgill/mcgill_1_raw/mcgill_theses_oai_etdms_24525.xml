The dryer is capable of drying 5 kg of fish in 10 hours. Water was first heated in a flat-plate solar collector then through thermosyphon effect, heat and mass was moved to the heat exchanger where heat was transferred to the air. Heated air was allowed to flow through the drying chamber where trays of prepared samples of fish were laid. Pre-drying treatment of fish similar to those used in commercial practice, were used for individual drying experiments in order to permit a general evaluation of the system. Seven drying experiments using different fish samples were conducted and the data generated was used to determine the efficiency of the system in terms of solar energy utilization. Results indicate that the system function efficiently at a minimal water temperature increase of 10$ sp circ$C, and the dryer operates at a system efficiency of 9 per cent which compares well with the findings of Yu Wai Man (1986) which found that natural convection solar dryers operate in the efficiency range between 7 to 14 per cent.</description><creator>Sotocinal, Samson A.</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Fishery products -- Drying.</subject><subject>Solar dryers.</subject><title>Design and testing of a natural convection solar fish dryer</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cf95jc55h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rv042v04n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Agricultural Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zp38wd92f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Measurements of vertical and horizontal components of hydraulic conductivity were made by the falling head permeameter, the standard piezometer and the piezometer with packing device on 4 farms in the Saint-Lawrence lowlands of Quebec, Canada. All fields are considered to be between imperfectly and slowly drained. The values obtain by the 2 types of piezometer were calculated with the aid of 3 different equations and were compared. The falling head permeameter technique was found to be not appropriate to study anisotropy in clay and clay loam soils due to its high variability and small volume of soil sampled.

Hydrogen was injected into the argon plasma tailflame ranging in molar concentration from 0 to 23%. The residue was continuously fed to the reactor in liquid form at flow rates ranging from 6 to 9 g/min. The mean plasma temperature was varied from 2700 to 3670 K. A maximum of 10% of the residue pyrolysed with up to 90% conversion to gaseous hydrocarbons. The rate of residue pyrolysis and the rate of formation of the gaseous products were found to be strongly dependent on heat transfer. The only gaseous products detected were acetylene, ethylene and methane. A considerable amount of soot was also observed, but no liquid hydrocarbons were produced. The soot contained some residue particles which were ejected into the gas phase in the form of small droplets during the pyrolysis. Due to the short gas-residence time, these tiny particles reacted only to a small extent while entrained in the gas. Elemental analysis of the unreacted residue, at the various operating conditions, showed that there was no change from the original, untreated CANMET residue. This indicated that the pyrolysis was uniform at those conditions and that there was no preferential removal of carbon, hydrogen or nitrogen.</description><creator>El-Naas, Muftah Hassan</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Continuous pyrolysis of canmet residue in argonhydrogen plasma</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6682x509w.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sj139307h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q811kk794</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Anthony Vidler's recent monograph on the eighteenth-century French architect Claude-Nicolas Ledoux (1736-1806) characterizes certain aspects of Ledoux's work as Masonic. Vidler defines Freemasonry primarily as an instrument of sociability. His recognition of Masonic imagery and intent, especially in Ledoux's Ideal City, combines with certain details of Ledoux's life to convince Vidler of Ledoux's adherence to a Masonic or quasi-Masonic lodge. The matter remains open to debate. Vidler's view of Freemasonry does not entirely accord with its factious and ambitious condition in eighteenth-century France. Nor does he sufficiently address the public manifestation of Masonic symbolism which, despite the Order's code of secrecy, was divulged to the profane, emerging architecturally as part of Neoclassicism's stylistic revival of the antique. The weakness of Vidler's analysis becomes apparent when he overlooks Masonic symbolism in a project that does not conform to his positive image of the Order: Ledoux's network of customs houses for Paris, the project he called the Propylaea.</description><creator>Langford, Martha</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Freemasonry -- France -- Symbolism</subject><subject>Ledoux, Claude Nicolas, 1736-1806</subject><title>Une architecture murmurante : an expression of freemasonry in Claude-Nicolas Ledoux's Propylaea for Paris?</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nz8060925.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q811kk794</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Art History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sf268631b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Isak Dinesen's Seven Gothic Tales is part of a literary tradition whose most important feature is its subversiveness. This subversion involves supernatural or fantastic elements in the creation of a temporary alternative world. The ensuing struggle between the real and the fantastic worlds is often embodied by a bourgeois heroine and an aristocratic male villain, respectively. The role of the heroine is pivotal to the plot for it is her survival that signals the defeat of a subversive alternative world. But what happens when the villain is a woman? Can her subversion be feminist in nature? The popularity and financial success of women writers of the Gothic means they could not have contradicted dominant views of gender. Yet, Dinesen's fiction demonstrates that subversion is indeed possible. A look at her life and her nonfiction works will facilitate an investigation into the subversive nature of her Gothic tales.</description><creator>Cossaro-Price, Rossana</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Dinesen, Isak, 1885-1962.

Powell uses a homodiegetic narrator to tell the stories of a vast array of characters over a large span of time. This narrator, Nicholas Jenkins, is, in the non-sexual sense of the word, voyeuristic. He watches and remembers the actions of others while only participating minimally. Widmerpool, the only other character to appear in all twelve volumes, is a voyeur in the sexual sense of the word. The defining feature of voyeurism is its fundamental asymmetry: the voyeur watches whilst remaining hidden and unseen. It will be argued that the reader is also involved in acts of voyeurism due to his/her asymmetrical relationship with the text. Although this equation of voyeurism and reading may seem to contradict recent reader-response critics, it will be argued that voyeurism is an apt description for the primary stage of reading.</description><creator>Thomson, Alexis, 1863-1924.</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Voyeurism.</subject><subject>Powell, Anthony, 1905-2000.

Lighthall remained a staunch imperialist, believing that Canada's future would find its fullest expression within the British Empire, and an adament idealist, asserting the primacy of individual responsibility and community rights. Together these two strains of thought, imperialism and idealism, formed the leitmotif of Lighthall's career: as a poet, novelist and anthologist Lighthall never questioned society's values and mores, he stressed them; similarly, as an urban reformer he underestimated the power of organized capital and, in the end, advocated repressive reforms. Although he was neither a particularly good writer nor a particularly effective reformer, Lighthall nonetheless preached a socialist vision of society--organic, collective, as something independent of the individuals who happened to live there.</description><creator>Wright, Donald A., 1965-</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Intellectuals -- Canada.</subject><subject>Lighthall, W.

Male bodybuilders (N = 13) who had been self-administering AS for 2.5 to 12 years served as subjects and participated in a 14 to 16 week experience sampling procedure wherein brief mood questionnaires were filled out twice daily. Findings revealed that 11 of the 13 subjects experienced self-reported mood changes in association with AS use. In particular, 2 subjects (subjects 4 &amp; 11) experienced quite dramatic changes in mood.

The housing co-op milieu is a highly suitable terrain for reflections on feminist urban theory. 'Public' and 'private' space, identity and place, and 'community' and community development are central themes addressed in this study. Members of each co-op were interviewed using a semi-directed interview guide. Social interaction is analysed qualitatively and focuses on the content of exchanges between co-op residents and patterns of socialising. The study concludes with an analysis of spatial micropolitics in terms of conflict and co-operation.</description><creator>Yasmeen, Gis√®le</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Women -- Housing</subject><subject>Housing, Cooperative -- Qu√©bec (Province) -- Montr√©al</subject><title>Mutual aid networks in two feminist housing co-operatives in Montreal</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fj2363170.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3j333333m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:t722hb00f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Detonations in decane aerosol-oxygen mixtures were studied with the aim being to contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of propagation of the detonation front. The decane aerosol, of about 5 $ mu$m droplet size, is generated by an ultrasonic nebulizer and remains in the liquid phase prior to ignition. A vertical detonation tube 64 mm in diameter and 3 m long was used. Ignition of the mixtures was attained using an exploding wire (120 Joules stored energy) or a solid explosive detonator. Comparison of the experimentally measured detonation velocity and pressure to the theoretical Chapman-Jouguet velocity and pressure indicates the existence of a self-sustained heterogeneous detonation. Cellular structure was recorded on soot covered metallic foils, indicating a three-dimensional detonation structure similar to gas phase detonations. The physical processes of breakup, heat transfer, evaporation, and mixing present in the heterogeneous medium were eliminated by heating of the mixtures to the vapor phase. Comparison of cell size for the same mixtures in the heterogeneous liquid phase and in the homogeneous vapor phase reveals that aerosol detonations possess physical processes that increase the length scale of the detonation. Furthermore, the measurements of cellular structure obtained experimentally are compared with the computed results determined using a chemical kinetic detonation model and the length scales of the mixtures in the vapor phase are found to be in good agreement with the computed results.</description><creator>Papavassiliou, John</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Measurements of cellular structure in liquid aerosol detonation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rb68xc819.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t722hb00f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7p88ch78f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In mineral processing, the liberation distribution of the mineral phases in an ore is an important factor. Unfortunately, liberation distribution is very difficult to measure accurately. One problem is the stereological effect associated with a microscopic liberation analysis. Many methods have been proposed to correct for the stereological effect, but they remain essentially untested, in part due to the lack of a standard or reference material. In this work, a method was established to create an artificial standard material. Silica grains were placed in an epoxy resin to create a block of material that was crushed to yield liberated and locked particles. The composition, and thus liberation, of these particles was determined with a series of heavy liquid separations. By changing the grain size to particle size ratio, the type and amount of locking was affected. The best compromise between the amount of locked material produced and the production of simple locked particles (which pose the greatest stereological challenge) was found; it occurred at the point where the grain and particle sizes were the same. Liberation analyses were performed on this material and compared with a model prediction based on the sectioning of spheres with single planar interfaces. There were some discrepancies between the analysis and model results.</description><creator>Lin, David</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Mineralogy.</subject><subject>Engineering, Mining.</subject><title>The production of a standard material for liberation analysis /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kp78gh44c.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7p88ch78f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:73666560d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Length of hospital stay was analyzed in Ile-de-France, for 1147 patients with drug poisoning, diabetes mellitus, head trauma, varicoses veins, urinary calculus, gall-stone disease, or myocardial infarction. The explanatory variables (socio-demographic, hospital, and clinical characteristics) were different from one diagnosis to another; the percentage of variance explained laid between 13% and 26%, depending on the specific diagnosis. Results confirm that length of stay is more than a managerial indicator; it also contains clinical-epidemiological information. Results from multiple linear regression, logistic regression, and Cox model were compared for diabetes mellitus and myocardial infarction. From a managerial point of view, logistic regression provided operational information, whereas results from multiple linear regression, as an explanatory method, were disappointing. Cox model was less interesting since there is not censoring data in this study population.

A speech interface is a system comprised of a speech recognition system, for speech input, and a speech generation or speech synthesis system, for speech output. These interfaces allow the operation of a computer system using voice commands providing the user with feedback via speech output. Such systems permit users to perform "hands-free" and "eyes-free" data entry or system operation in circumstances where the use of traditional manual input devices, such as a keyboard, cannot be used. This thesis begins with a literature sampling of contemporary computerized medical information systems and speech interface systems followed by a description of the hardware and software architecture of the speech interface implemented. Test results are then presented and discussed followed by an outline of future extensions for the system.</description><creator>Petroni, Marco</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Health Sciences, Health Care Management.</subject><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>A speech interface for bedside data entry in an intensive care unit /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k0698862g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gx41mk17p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gh93h0683</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A 4.87 hectare potato field at St. Leonard d'Aston, Quebec was instrumented to measure surface runoff and tile drain flow over the 2 year growing season period, 1989-1990. The soil type was a Ste. Jude sandy loam. Several soil and water parameters and NPK concentrations in runoff were measured. The CREAMS (Chemicals, Runoff and Erosion from Agricultural Management Systems) computer simulation model was validated for the study site. Observed N concentrations in tile drain flow exceeded the Canadian water quality guideline of 10 mg/L. Observed P concentrations were less than 0.01 mg/L; and K concentrations, for the most part, exceeded 10 mg/L. CREAMS overpredicted event surface runoff depths, and underpredicted event percolation depths. However, total monthly surface runoff and percolation depths closely matched observed values. CREAMS overpredicted event nitrate concentrations in tile drain flow. There was a poor match between predicted and observed event nitrate concentrations in tile drain flow (coefficient of predictability, CP$ sb{ rm A}$ = 104.95). However, predicted total monthly nitrate load closely matched observed values (CP$ sb{ rm A}$ = 0.84). Total monthly and seasonal nitrate loads in tile drain flow were underpredicted.</description><creator>Wiyo, Kenneth Alfred Wiskot</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Groundwater -- Pollution -- Computer simulation.</subject><subject>Subsurface drainage -- Computer simulation.</subject><subject>Groundwater -- Pollution -- Measurement.</subject><subject>Potatoes -- Fertilizers.</subject><title>Measurements and modelling of fertilizer concentrations in subsurface drain flow from a potato field</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z029p575z.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gh93h0683</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Agricultural Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5t34sk650</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The issue of nonresponse to surveys is a serious problem in survey research because it reduces the amount of information obtained, creates a significant nuisance for data analysis and may introduce bias into the survey results by flawing the representativeness of the target population under investigation. This paper examines item-nonresponse and "don't know" responses in the General Social Survey of Canada of 1985 and comments specifically on the different effects of personal and telephone interviewing technique on rate of item omission. The effect of sensitivity of the question, and position of the item in the questionnaire on nonresponse are also examined in an exploratory descriptive analysis. Results of an analysis of variance and multiple regression/correlation indicate that both sensitivity and position are factors influencing item omission. In addition, demographic characteristics were found to be significantly and differentially correlated with item omission and "don't know" responses by topic area for the survey under investigation. The results of this study further demonstrate that telephone interviewing significantly increases the rate of item omission, especially for questions on social support.</description><creator>Auriat, Nadia M.</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Canada -- Statistics</subject><subject>Questionnaires</subject><subject>Social surveys -- Response rate</subject><title>An analysis of item nonresponse and "don't know" responses in the Feneral Social Survey of Canada, 1985 /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tq57ns19h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5t34sk650</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Sociology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:r494vm16f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In processing lobster, approximately 70% of the body weight is discarded as waste. The solid waste consists of shell, viscera and a small amount of meat. Lobster waste is an excellent source of protein (26.6%) crude fat (2.7%) and pigment (98 $ mu$g/g) on a dry weight basis which could be processed into a stable complex known as carotenoprotein. Procedures for extraction of carotenoprotein from lobster waste have been developed, along with investigation of its distinctive physicochemical properties. The main factors were: demineralization agents (EDTA, HCl or heat) and precipitation agents ((NH$ sb4$)$ sb2$SO$ sb4$ or HCl). Lobster carotenoprotein recovered under different extraction procedures showed significant differences in terms of quantity and quality of the product recovered. However the procedures did not appear to affect the physical properties and amino acid profiles of carotenoprotein. Optimal recovery involved treatment with EDTA as demineralization agent and precipitation with (NH$ sb4$)$ sb2$SO$ sb4$. Proximate and amino acid analyses indicated the potential of the recovered lyophilized protein as feed ingredient for cultured salmonids.</description><creator>Dauphin, Laurie</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Carotenoids</subject><subject>Fishery processing industries -- By-products.</subject><subject>Lobster industry -- By-products.</subject><title>Enhancing value of lobster waste by enzymatic methods</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w9505164n.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r494vm16f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p8418p39h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>After having considered the linguistic aspects of legislative drafting, this study undertakes to summarize its main characteristics in Civil Law (mainly in French Civil Law countries) and Common Law. The concept of law, the perception of statutory materials in the two legal systems, as well as the drafting techniques and style in the two systems are analysed in a comparative way. The same matters are examined in the Canadian context, especially at the levels of the federal and Quebec governments. This study of statutory drafting in France (Belgium and Switzerland), England and Canada also aims at stressing the Canadian approach both in Civil and Common Law.</description><creator>Lizotte, Dominique</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Law.</subject><title>La r√©daction des lois en droit civil et en common law /</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vt150k33c.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p8418p39h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q524jp90w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Data taken with the ARGUS detector at DESY, Hamburg, specifically BB pairs produced from $e sp+e sp-$ collisions at the energy of the $ Upsilon$(4S) resonance, are used to investigate the decay channel $B sp- to rho sp0 ell sp- bar nu.$ Observation of a signal would be conclusive evidence that the CKM matrix element $V sb{ub}$ is non-zero, a necessary condition for the validity of the Kobayashi-Maskawa explanation for CP violation. The recoil mass technique is employed to try to isolate signal events. Monte Carlo data are used to model the signal background, which is dominated by reasonably well understood $b to c$ decays. Using the model of Wirbel, Stech, and Bauer, a model-dependent upper limit of 1.6 $ times$ 10$ sp{-2}$ is placed on the value of $ vert V sb{ub} vert$ at 90% confidence. The results, however, suggest that further study of the $b to c$ background is warranted. In particular, B meson transitions to states with higher mass than the $D sp*$ may contribute significantly.</description><creator>Saull, P. R. B.

Both rearing condition and genotype affect temperature preference. The following results were obtained: (1) the wing morph of juveniles raised at 28$ sp circ$C 16hL:8hD is determined before 20 days post hatching. (2) Crickets distribute themselves on the apparatus differently in the presence of a thermal gradient than in its absence: such controls for positioning preference are rare in the literature. (3) Juveniles younger than 20 days old tend to choose higher surface temperatures and achieve higher body temperatures if either rearing photoperiod or selection predisposes them to microptery and choose lower temperatures if they are predisposed towards macroptery. (4) The differences in thermal preference between presumptive macropters and micropters remains significant after differences in body size are taken into account. The differences in thermal preference could act as a novel mechanism for lowering the heritability of wing morph.</description><creator>Shannon, Patrick</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Body temperature.</subject><subject>Crickets -- Behavior.</subject><subject>Crickets -- Genetics.</subject><title>Presumptive wing morph and thermal preference in juvenile sand crickets (Gryllus firmus)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1831cm16j.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qb98mg66j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3x816n64f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In the southern Selwyn Range, Hadrynian Miette Group strata form a thick conformable sequence. A distinctive carbonate unit in the middle Miette Group is assigned to the Old Fort Point Formation. Facies variations in the middle Miette Group, from grit dominated in the east to pelite dominated in the west, delineate a channel or fan lobe margin. Structures in the southern Selwyn Range developed during three main phases of deformation. The Fraser River Antiform, the dominant structure, formed during D$ sb2$. The Selwyn Range Fault cross-cut the earlier Fraser River Antiform during early D$ sb3$. The Fraser River Antiform tightened during late D$ sb3$, when the Selwyn Range Fault was reactivated, forming a 100m thick shear zone. The Chatter Creek Fault (D$ sb3$ or latter) has compressional and dextral motion, both with minor displacement.

We consider some acoustic parameters computed from the auditory spectrogram, and other parameters computed from the speech waveform. The classification algorithm uses a recurrent multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with localized connections. The design of the classifier is motivated by knowledge in phonetics and in pattern recognition. We report experiments for the TIMIT database, using 343 speakers in the training set and 77 different speakers in the test set. Good performance is obtained when many acoustic parameters are fed to the MLP, and when the MLP desired outputs represent context-dependent articulatory features. Classification is performed by Principal Component Analysis of the MLP outputs. Refinement of the design parameters yield increasingly better performance on the test set, ranging from 45% errors for a perceptron to 23.3% errors for the best MLP.</description><creator>Flammia, Giovanni</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Speaker-independent consonant classification with distinctive features</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3f462662t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3r074w25h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6682x511x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The present thesis is concerned with the development of an expert system for the preliminary design of point-to-point HVDC transmission systems, TRANSEPT-DC. This expert system module complements other expert system modules concerned with AC design, insulation coordination, and reliability, all of which form the TRANSEPT family of expert systems for the preliminary design of point-to-point power transmission systems. The domain knowledge of the design of HVDC transmission systems is first discussed. This includes possible HVDC system configurations, cost of terminals, cost of transmission lines, cost of losses, and design expertise. The details of converting the HVDC design domain knowledge into a structured knowledge base is demonstrated. Objects, properties, classes, and object-oriented programming techniques are introduced. Then, the implementation of rules and the architecture of a complete expert system including man-machine interface, external interface and data storage is presented. A sample run from TRANSEPT-DC on an Intel 80386-based personal computer is provided to demonstrate the performance and the basic features of the HVDC expert system.</description><creator>Truong, Quoc-duy</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Artificial Intelligence.</subject><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Use of expert systems in the preliminary design of high voltage DC point-to-point transmission systems</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k930bz37p.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6682x511x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k643b2352</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis describes the architecture of the Kali multi-arm robot control system, including discussions on design trade-offs and performance, as well as a detailed implementation using off-the-shelf hardware and software. Kali's main objectives are flexibility, integration, and hardware and software modularity so as to facilitate programming, experimentation and portability. It is used primarily to prototype concepts in multi-arm coordination, teleoperation, force control, and sensor fusion etc. To implement Kali requires only a minimal real-time kernel, a sufficiently powerful computer and a robot interface. It is based on the principle that, today, computational hardware, real-time operating systems and robot interfaces no longer impede robot controller design. Rather it is control software and system integration which are now the main problems. To that end, this work also discusses in depth the fundamental problems in the design and engineering of robot controllers from an implementational point of view using Kali as a primary design example.</description><creator>Topper, Anthony</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>A computing architecture for a multiple robot controller /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v692t7508.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k643b2352</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:m039k623n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:09:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Polyethylene was thermally oxidized in the presence of air with cobalt(III) tris-(2,4-pentanedionate) as a catalyst and dicumyl peroxide as an initiator. The optimum temperature for oxygen addition was found to be 150$ sp circ$C. At this temperature, after reaction with 4 wt% catalyst and.4 wt% initiator for three hours, the solid residue was 11.5 mol% oxygen, with a number average molecular weight of 2,500, and there was no overall weight loss. Higher temperatures led to lower oxygen content, equal or higher molecular weight and significant weight loss. Infrared analysis indicated that the ratio of carbonyl to hydroxyl oxygen was a constant. It was concluded that volatilization became a dominant factor and oxygen containing molecules were lost from the solid. Some of the samples were used as the sole carbon source in fermentations with Yarrowia lipolytica and Arthrobacter paraffineus, but no growth was achieved.</description><creator>Williams, Gregory R.
