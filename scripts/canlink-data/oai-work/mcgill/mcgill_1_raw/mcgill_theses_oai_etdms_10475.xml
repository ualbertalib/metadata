This has led to the accumulation of valuable information as well as to the proposal of several theories concerning the abnormal effects occurring in plants when grown on a substratum in which the available supply of boron is inadequate or lacking.  An examination of the literature on the study of the physiological effects occuring in plants due to a lack of boron reveals that there is a good deal of evidence to indicate a relationship existing between calcium and boron. Observations show that this interrelationship occurs both in the soil and in the plant. After much experimental work and observations in the field and greenhouse, a number of investigators have concluded that several factors may determine whether or not plants will suffer from a deficiency of boron. The least important of these factors may be fee boron content of the surface soil, while of much greater importance may be the permeability of the subsoil horizons and those factors which affect boron availability such as the supply of calcium, organic matter and soil texture. On the other hand the possibility of this interrelationship between calcium and boron occuring in the plant rather than in the soil has been brought forth by thee fact that numerous investigators have shown that the pathological symptoms produced in plants by a boron deficiency are remarkably similar to those produced by a calcium deficiency under like experimental conditions.[...]</description><creator>Macleod, Donald.</creator><contributor>Coulson, J.

It aims to give a broad treatment of the subject without overlooking significant details. In the preparation of such a study it will be necessary to refer to the background of ideas and their historical unfolding. For this reason, therefore, reference is made to the writings of church historians, reports in contemporary newspapers, articles in religious periodicals, records of proceedings, legislative enactments, and quotations from religious and educational leaders. The literature in the field is meagre and is largely limited to incidental references in books on other subjects. An organized bibliography is appended. It should not be forgotten that the Baptist denomination is one of the largest Protestant groups in the world. It numbers about thirteen million communicant members, and probably fifty to sixty million adherents. A very large number of these are to be found in the United States and their ratio to the total population in Canada is comparatively small; nevertheless, as this study will show, they have made a worthy contribution to educational effort in this country. Unlike most other denominations, the Baptists do not trace their origin to any particular founder. On the contrary, many streams of thought arising independently have contributed to the formation of the Baptist Denomination of today.

There was no clearly demonstrated superiority of one method over the other. An analysis of variance performed on observed mortalities expressed as angles of equal information indicated that increasing age of flies, increasing numbers of flies per cage, longer delays between filling of the cages and spraying, and increased proportions of males in the samples, raised observed mortalities significantly. The type of cloth used to cover the cages must be standardized. Data on fly ages and numbers of flies per cage were also put through the probit analysis of Bliss which indicated flies aged 5 days to be most susceptible and fly numbers to affect equally the mortalities due to all concentrations.</description><creator>McLeod, William Sterling.</creator><contributor>Brittain, W.

No authentic history of the family before the eighteenth century has been discovered, but Jacob Mountain’s earlier biographer discusses several conjectural lines of descent. There is a possible connection between the Mountain family of Norfolk and George Montaigne, Bishop of Durham (later Archbishop of York) in the early seventeenth century. There is a further possible connection with one Abraham de Montaigne, Chaplain to the Falloon refugees who fled from Flanders and found refuge in Norfolk about 1593. This Abraham de Montaigne’s son Isaac, and grandson Jacob, identified themselves with the Church of England. The latter Jacob’s name appears in the register of St. Augustin’s, Norwich. Stuart is emphatic in asserting that Jacob Mountain’s descent from Montaigne the celebrated French essayist, is highly improbable. Another conjecture, namely that Bishop Mountain was descended from French Huguenot refugee stock, is rendered unlikely by the opinion of the French Huguenot Society of England, which Mr. Stuart was careful to ascertain. Be that as it may, the tradition of Huguenot ancestry is very strong. [...]</description><creator>Millman, Thomas R., 1905-</creator><contributor>Cooper, J.

The importance of the economic basis," as he has called it, first dawned on him at a lecture given by Henry George before the Land Nationalization Society in London in 1882. Nevertheless, during his boyhood and youth in Dublin, influences were at work which help to explain his later career. The boy's father, George Carr Shaw, was an *rish Protestant who fought a losing battle to maintain his position in upper middle-class society. He was a timid, inefficient man holding first a minor post in the Dublin Courts of Justice and later becoming an unsuccessful wholesale dealer in corn.[...]</description><creator>Stabler, Ernest.</creator><contributor>Files, H.

Their elliptical leaves are glabrous on both surfaces, glossy, and frequently reddened above. The inflorescence is a short denseflowered ovoid panicle. The two types of heterostyled flowers are segregated on separate plants. The £hort-styled flowers contain long anthers with a very much reduced ovary. The long-styled flowers have a well developed ovary, but the stamens are reduced. The long-styled type is characteristic of the inflorescences used in this study. The deeply colored pink calyx is extremely conspicuous. The five much reduced stamens bear thin-walled shrunken anthers, and, according to Stanford (30), are mostly devoid of pollen. The two-parted style is separated to about the middle. The upper branches of the style diverge and are rather conspicuous in the fruit. The object of this work was to make a study of the developing ovule and fruit of P. natans, forma genuinum.</description><creator>Stevens, Thelma Vivian.</creator><contributor>Roscoe, M.

However, the deduction of reliabledecomposition mechanisms from thermal data is difficult becauseof the complexity of the changes involved. Consequently, thepresent trend in the field of gas kinetics is to investigate thedecomposition of the lower aliphatic hydrocarbons by othermethods. One of the·se, the reac·tion of hydrocarbons withhydrogen atoms, produced by the Wood-Bonhoeffer electricdischargemethod, has received considerable attention. Studiesof the decomposition of isobutane and of butadiene by thismethod are the subject of the present investigations. However,before dealing with th9s~,it is necessary first to outlinebrierly the essential features of unimolecular gas reactions,and to cite the information available from various sourceson the decomposition reactions of the simple hydrocarbons.</description><creator>White, William Harold.</creator><contributor>Winkler, C.

While occasional new processes were invented and patents granted, the commercial production of milk powder dates back only to the closing years of the nineteenth century. However despite the many improvements\ in processing since that time, whole milk powder is still a relatively unstable product. The greatly increased demand because of the war has again focused attention on the difficulties involved in the preparation of a product which would resist the unfavourable conditions of military requirements. It was found at the outset of this investigation that available methods were not sufficiently sensitive to detect incipient chemical changes which occur in whole milk powders and which result in disagreeable flavours and odours.[...]</description><creator>Chapman, Ross Alexander.</creator><contributor>MacFarlane, W.

It is interesting to note that the name haspersisted to the present although the early theory of itsfunction has been discarded. These ideas of the specificfunction of the pituitary were based on theoreticalspeculation and observation rather than experimental experienceand consequently were not easily corrected.Other theories of its function were upheld from time totime, but they did not threaten the theory of Galen and'his followers very seriously.
