It is equally well known that metals are oxidized by various solutions. The reaction whereby a metal is oxidized by a hot solution and then the resulting solution is reduced back to the metallic state on cooling is a more recent discovery. Berzelius (4), for example, noted that metallic copper was attacked by a hot solution containing cupric ion and that powdered copper precipitated from this solution when it was cooled.</description><creator>Ufford, John.

It has gradually evolved from minor branches of activity in Engineering, Physics, and Geology. Today it may be considered as being a separate field of scientific endeavour. The earliest investigations into the behaviour of rocks under pressure were described over a hundred and fifty years ago. Observations related the observed phenomena to geological structures, and were qualitative rather than quantitative.</description><creator>Udd, John. E.</creator><contributor>Morrison, R.

Cellulose is a linear polymer consisting or B-D-glucopyranose residues linked together by (1 4) glycosidic bonds. In native celluloses, no less than 5,000 such residues are probably present in an average cellulose macromolecule, corresponding to a weight-average degree of polymerization of 10,000 if the ratio between number and weight-average values is assumed to be the usual 1:2.</description><creator>Tyminski, Andrew.</creator><contributor>Timell, T.

Geology has assisted in making Montreal an entrepot between the Atlantic and the St. Lawrence - Great Lakes hinterland. The Sault St. Louis or Lachine Rapids, at the south-west corner of the island, are composed of extremely hard rock which resists the erosive character of the river. The Lachine Rapids are turbulent and dangerous, so that the port of Montreal at the foot of them is the farthest point accessible to ships ascending the St. Lawrence.</description><creator>Tulchinsky, Gerald.

The addition of solid particles to the fluid flow creates a new and even more complicated situation because of the interplay of momentum between the fluid-solid boundaries on the particles and the boundary containing the flow. In contrast with work in pure fluid flow, little has been done in the case of solids-gas movement, and the design of these systems remains, at times, a very costly art.</description><creator>Torobin, Leonard.

There appears to have been a pattern followed by scientists until the early 18th century; many scientists were “gentlemen of leisure” and scientists by hobby. As well, the necessary equipment for scientific investigation in its rudimentary stages was inexpensive enough so that individuals could afford to purchase or construct their own. However the increasing complexity and cost of equipment and supplies used in scientific research has now made it practical and necessary for centralization and corporate ownership of research facilities.</description><creator>Tiger, Lionel.

It is invested by a true fibrous capsule, which is continuous with the stroma of the gland. The thyroid consists of a pair of lobes joined across the anterior aspect of the trachea by the isthmus. Each lobe extends proximally along the lateral aspect of the thyroid cartilage, and distally along the upper part of the trachea. The lobes are related medially, to the thyroid and cricoids cartilages, to the trachea and oesophagus, and to the external and recurrent laryngeal nerves.</description><creator>Thompson, Benjamin.
