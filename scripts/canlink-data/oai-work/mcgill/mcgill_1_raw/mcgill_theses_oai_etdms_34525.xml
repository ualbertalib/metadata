Chapters 2--4 of this thesis look at mechanisms carried out by the recently cloned DNA demethylase, how its demethylation activity is closely linked with the semblance of acetylation of chromatin, and how this relationship can be skewed in cancer. The three intriguing mechanisms described provide attractive models by which to explain general genome wide demethylation, site specific demethylation of genes upon their activation, and the relationship between aberrant methylation and histone acetylation in cancer. The thesis begins by characterizing the mechanism of demethylation carried out by the bona fida DNA demethylase---an enzyme identified and cloned in our laboratory found to demethylate both hemi and double-stranded DNA in vitro. This enzyme manifests the removal of methyl groups from DNA without damaging the DNA and is therefore a candidate protein responsible for hypomethylation seen during development as well as in transformed cells. One essential property of an enzyme that removes methylation from wide regions of the genome could be processivity. Southern blot analysis and sodium bisulfite mapping experiments determine that purified demethylase demethylates DNA in a processive manner in vitro. Experiments in Chapter 3 demonstrate how an active demethylase enzyme is involved in shaping patterns of methylation relative to the state of histone acetylation. We present evidence suggesting demethylase activity is directed by the state of histone acetylation, therefore contrasting the accepted dogma, and suggesting that the local histone acetylation state determines the resulting methylation pattern. Aberrant DNA methylation and histone deacetylation are frequently associated with silencing of tumor suppressor genes in cancer and yet cannot simply be explained by the level of methyltransferase(s) enzyme(s)</description><creator>Cervoni, Nadia.</creator><contributor>Szyf, Moshe (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>DNA demethylation and histone acetylation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/np193b55j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6t053h714</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mk61rj778</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:46:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Parathyroid Hormone-related Protein (PTHrP) was first identified as a tumor-derived product responsible for Malignancy Associated Hypercalcemia. The protein was characterized based on its ability to mimic Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) in kidney and bone. PTHrP is a secretory peptide with limited homology to PTH at the amino-terminus that allows it to bind to the common PTH/PTHrP receptor (PTH1R). Normal secretion of PTHrP has now been demonstrated in a number of tissues where it acts as an autocrine/paracrine mediator of cell growth and differentiation. Much of the documented biological activity of PTHrP is mediated through PTH1R however a body of evidence indicates that PTHrP uses multiple signal pathways in target tissues. One of these pathways consists of an intracellular signal mechanism that is dependent on a bipartite nucleolar targeting signal (NTS) located between residues 87--107 of the mature protein. This sequence is similar to the NTS motifs found in the nucleolar HIV-1 proteins Tat and Rev. Studies have shown that the NTS of PTHrP is both necessary and sufficient to target PTHrP to the nucleus and nucleolus of a variety of cells. Nuclear localization has been associated with altered gene expression, proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. The mechanism used by this secretory protein to gain access to the nucleus is largely unknown. We examined the possibility that PTHrP is internalized from the cell surface and transported to the nucleolus in a manner dependent on the NTS. Using transiently transfected COS-1 cells we demonstrated NTS dependent localization of full-length PTHrP at the plasma membrane and in nuclear compartments. Site-directed mutagenesis identified an 87GxKKxxK93 motif at the N-terminus of the NTS that is critical for nuclear/nucleolar targeting. A biotin-labeled PTHrP-NTS peptide was internalized and localized to the nucleolus in a time and dose-dependent manner whereas a similarly basic NLS peptide was not. Internalization of PTHrP-N We investigated whether binding to resident RNA structures targets PTHrP to the nucleolus. We have shown that transfected, in vitro translated and endogenous PTHrP bind to homopolymeric and cellular RNA with high affinity and specificity. Binding was dependent on the NTS and in particular the 87GxKKxxK93 motif. This motif is also a conserved sequence in double-stranded RNA binding proteins. This work represents the first demonstration of RNA binding by a secretory protein and predicts a role for PTHrP in regulating ribosome biogenesis in the nucleolus.

This volcanic lineament thus offers an unique opportunity to probe the lithospheric mantle beneath these terranes and investigate the relative roles of lithospheric and asthenospheric mantle sources in the generation of alkaline lavas. Alkaline lavas in twelve volcanic centres of the Stikine Volcanic Belt were sampled and studied for major and trace elements and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions. The primitive lavas of each volcanic centre define binary arrays between two compositional end-members, olivine nephelinite (NEPH) and hypersthene-normative olivine basalt (Hy-NORM). The NEPH end-member is characterized by large enrichments in incompatible trace elements with respect to primitive mantle, but is depleted in term of its isotopic composition. The presence of amphibole in its source suggests that this end-member is derived from the lithospheric mantle. The Hy-NORM end-member has lower incompatible trace element contents, but is still relatively enriched in incompatible elements compared to primitive mantle. Although this end-member has always more radiogenic Sr and Pb, and less radiogenic Nd isotopic ratios than the NEPH end-member, its isotopic signature varies with the tectonic belt in which it erupted, indicating a significant role for the lithospheric mantle in the derivation of the Hy-NORM basalts. The Canadian Cordilleran, and other continental Hy-NORM basalts, have low Ca and high Na contents compared to their equivalents at oceanic hot spots such as Hawaii or associated with mid-ocean ridges. A comparison with experimental melts of mantle peridotite indicates that these characteristics reflect smaller degrees of partial melting (&lt;10%) in continental regime. The range of observed lava compositions is explained by the melting of two distinct lithospheric components, a NEPH end-member representing the melting of amphibole-rich veins, and a Hy-NORM end-member resulting from small degrees of partial melting of their host garnet lherzolite. The high heat flow values reported in the northern Canadian Cordillera are consistent with a model in which ongoing melting and thinning of the lithospheric mantle is responsible for generating the mafic alkaline magmas.</description><creator>Abraham, Anne-Claude.</creator><contributor>Francis, Don (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Geology.</subject><subject>Geochemistry.</subject><title>The nature of mantle sources for recent alkaline basalts across the northern Canadian Cordillera /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m326m343c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h128ng30s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zp38wf458</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:46:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>On a papermaking machine, fines and colloids are retained in a paper sheet. The most important particle interactions are among particles having a high weight fraction and a short characteristic interaction time. Most of these interactions follow Langmuir kinetics, in which the flocculation efficiency is one of the important parameters. To enhance retention, many retention aids are available, one of which is neutral polyethylene oxide (PEO) used in combination of a phenolic cofactor (CF). In this work, a new model was derived in which all possible interactions were considered and assumed to follow Langmuir kinetics. Since fines are the main component in the headbox of mechanical grade furnishes, fines homo- and heteroflocculation with a PEO/CF retention aid were investigated in a circulating flow loop, and found to follow Langmuir kinetics. The small amount of fines deposited on the fibers was attributed to the large detachment rate in turbulent shear. The apparent difference in the deposition time and the half time of flocculation was attributed to difference in efficiency. Fines homoflocculation showed that fines are flocculated (without a retention aid) to various extents depending on shear, and that aggregates of flocs will form when a retention aid is added. The PEO/CF flocculation efficiency was found to be a function of various parameters, i.e., aging of PEO solution, stirring intensity and time of stirring during dissolution, concentration at storage, shearing and dilution prior to injection. Optimum conditions were found for most parameters, and a critical shear intensity was determined. This PEO behavior was attributed to the extent of entanglements of PEO coils, which can be characterized prior to its addition to the flocculation vessel by a newly developed method. In this method, the pressure drop of a PEO solution passing through a capillary constriction was measured and correlated with its flocculation efficiency. Using the derived correlation, the flocculation efficiency can be estimated, and the relevant parameters can be controlled. Moreover, the salt effect on a PEO/CF system in a pulp was investigated. Salt was found to react with a CF causing a decrease in the flocculation efficiency. The effect of this reaction can be eliminated if PEO is added directly after CF addition.</description><creator>Abdallah, Mohammad Raji AlGhazi.</creator><contributor>van de Ven, T. G. M.

The first is to modify the existing Present Value Model of the Current Account (PVMCA) to reflect the major features of the Nigerian economy and to determine if this resulting theoretical framework is valid for the analysis of the Nigerian current account for the period 1960--97. The second objective is to examine the excessiveness and sustainability of the Nigerian current account deficits during this period. To achieve these objectives, the thesis presents a model of current account determination that is based upon the permanent-income hypothesis of private consumption behavior. We derive a present value relationship among the current account, expected changes in net output and a consumption-based real interest rate. This thesis then extends this framework to incorporate changes in the terms of trade and possible asymmetric access to the international financial markets. It also conducts an empirical estimation of the several variants of the PVMCA. The econometric results show that an intertemporal model of current account determination that includes changes in the interest rate, exchange rate and terms of trade outperforms one that excludes them. This thesis represents the first attempt to use an intertemporal model of the current account and selected macroeconomic and structural indicators to assess the external position of the Nigerian economy. The empirical results support the hypothesis that current account deficits accompanied by macroeconomic instability and structural weaknesses can generate an external crisis.</description><creator>Adedeji, Olumuyiwa Samson.</creator><contributor>Handa, Jagdish (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Balance of payments -- Econometric models.</subject><subject>Balance of payments -- Nigeria -- Econometric models.</subject><title>The intertemporal approach to modeling the current account : evidence from Nigeria</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8k71nj78s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m900nw25r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Economics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:tm70mx05v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:46:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this research the dynamics of a non-reactive and a reactive gas bubble under various pressure fields are studied. Comprehensive mathematical models have been developed to simulate the dynamic behavior of different gas bubbles. On the basis of these models several features of thermo-fluid mechanical behavior of gas bubbles are then discussed and their applications for the metals processing operations are described. The mathematical models form a set of coupled, highly nonlinear and stiff differential equations, which have been solved numerically by a modified Gear method. The first part of this study is concerned with the transient dynamic behavior of a hydrogen gas bubble in a solidifying aluminium-3.4 wt pct copper alloy melt under various ultrasonic pressure fields. During the process of bubble collapse, the melt pressure surrounding the bubble is seen to increase very rapidly. The variations of pressure and supercooling in the melt surrounding the bubble can cause bulk crystallization. If the pressure in the vicinity of the dendrites exceeds a threshold value, dendrite fracturing takes place. Dendrite fragments become nuclei during metal crystallization in an ultrasonic field, which lead to the refined crystalline structure of the metal. The results show that adjacent to the bubble surface, the peak pressure generated in the melt is in the order of several hundreds to thousands atmospheres depending on the initial bubble size, pressure of undisturbed melt and the ultrasonic's specifications. The second part of this study is related to the dynamics of a stable bubble under various ultrasonic pressure fields. When the imposed pressure field is beyond a threshold value, dissolved gas in the liquid flows into the gas bubbles by rectified diffusion. In this case, the bubbles grow sufficiently to float to the surface due to the hydrodynamic buoyancy force. The results show that the air bubble grows and the time-averaged bubble volume reaches several times of its initial value when the ultrasonic pressure amplitude is more than the threshold pressure. The final part of this study consists of the complex dynamic behavior of a reactive gas bubble immersed in a nonreactive liquid under various liquid impulse pressures. Numerical investigations are conducted into the collapse and explosion of an isolated oxygen-hydrogen bubble immersed in water and in glycerin. The results show that, if the imposed pressure field is strong enough, the bubble is seen to explode.

Firstly, 12 Holstein cows were used to determine the effects of feeding calcium propionate (Ca prop) on dry matter intake (DMI) and production traits. The experimental design was a switchback with 2 treatments (Ca prop at 0 or 300 g/d). The DMI was lower when animals received Ca prop. Ca prop did not affect the yield of milk and its components; however, Ca prop increased protein content. The (acetate+butyrate)/propionate ratio in rumen fluid 2 h after feeding was lower when cows received Ca prop. Plasma insulin concentration was not different between treatments and the putative effect of propionate as an insulin secretagogue was probably related to the maintenance of insulin levels when DMI was lower. In conclusion, Ca prop is a potential feed ingredient to increase protein content in milk. The second approach consisted of intravenous infusion of insulin. A trial was designed to test the effects of insulin, recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbST) and their interaction in lactating dairy cows. Eight Holstein cows were used in a Latin Square design with 4 treatments: (1) intravenous infusion of saline, (2) infusion of saline and administration of 40 mg of rbST per day, (3) intravenous infusion of 12 mg of insulin per day coupled with glucose infusion and (4) rbST administration combined with insulin and glucose infusion. The theory that rbST causes a peripheral resistance to insulin was confirmed. Insulin infusion increased percent protein, percent casein and decreased milk urea content regardless of rbST administration. For milk yield, protein yield, casein yield, lactose percent and lactose yield, there was an interaction between insulin and rbST administration. Similarly, there was an interaction between insulin and rbST on plasma IGF-I levels. Fat yield was higher, with a higher content of long chain fatty acids, during rbST administration, regardless of insulin infusion.

The objective was to elucidate the role of surface heterogeneities on wetting and absorption properties of paper. To better understand the phenomena, wetting on glass slides with a controlled level of heterogeneity was investigated. Also, partially hydrophobized glass capillaries were used to simulate capillary penetration into the pores on sized paper. Dynamic wetting on paper followed a power law model with a lower rate than wetting on a smooth surface. The chemical composition of the paper surface did not affect the wetting dynamics, which was mainly affected by surface roughness in a micron scale. The super-hydrophobic properties of the sized papers were due to air entrapment in the micron-scale roughness on the surface. Wetting and absorption of water droplets on sized paper occurred in different time scales. A pseudo-equilibrium contact angle was reached at the end of wetting just before absorption of water droplets. Increasing the surface coverage of the hydrophobic domains on paper by sizing increased the pseudo-equilibrium contact angle and delayed absorption into paper. This delay was related to partial dissolution of the surface sizing polymers in the water droplets on the surface. The equilibrium contact angle of water droplets on partially hydrophobized glass slides was a linear function of a characteristic dimension of the hydrophobic domains and the length of the three phase contact line. The dynamic rise of water in partially hydrophobized vertical capillaries followed two mechanisms. First, capillary rise was a function of the dynamic contact angle, changing with the velocity of the contact line. Second, local changes of the advancing contact angle due to the heterogeneities on the capillary walls lowered the capillary rise velocity. The stick (pause) and jump of the contact line was another effect of the hydrophobic domains. Capillary rise dynamics was a function of the advancing contact angle of water droplets measured on a flat glass slide with the same coverage of hydrophobic domains.</description><creator>Modaressi-Esfeh, Hedieh.</creator><contributor>Garnier, Gil (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Wetting on heterogeneous surfaces</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1544br093.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kk91fn37n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:f4752j429</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:46:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis presents a study of inclusive production of charmonium mesons at the U (4S) resonance ( s = 10.58 GeV) and in the continuum up to 50 MeV below the resonance. The full dataset of BABAR Run 1 (an integrated luminosity of 23.3 fb-1) is used in the analysis. The branching fractions of B mesons to J/ y , y (2S), cc1 and cc2 are measured: BB→J/yX = (1.044 +/- 0.013 +/- 0.035)%, BB→y2S X = (0.274 +/- 0.020 +/- 0.029)%, BB→cc1X = (0.378 +/- 0.034 +/- 0.026)% and BB→cc2X &lt; 0.21%. By equating the y (2S) production rates calculated using the y (2S) → ℓ+ℓ- final state to those using y (2S) → pi+pi- J/ y , we obtain competitive measurements of the y (2S) → ℓ+ℓ- branching fractions: By2S →e+e- = (0.815 +/- 0.090 +/- 0.090)% and By2S →m+m- = (0.700 +/- 0.083 +/- 0.093)%. The cross-section for J/ y production in e+e - annihilation in the continuum is measured to be: se+e-→J/yX = (2.47 +/- 0.21 +/- 0.20) pb. This cross-section excludes J/ y mesons from B decays, two-photon or initial state radiation processes. An upper limit on the inclusive non-BB¯ J/ y decays of the U (4S) is set at BU4S →J/yX &lt; 5.1 x 10-4, for J/ y with the center of mass momentum above 2 GeV/c.

These developments underscore the importance of considering the relationship between biological and social change. This dissertation uses the epicentre of the HIV epidemic in West Africa---Abidjan, Cote-d'Ivoire---as a case study to show how epidemics are "crystallizations" of local biological and social factors. The Abidjan epidemic is accounted for in terms of the city's sexual modernity, rather than the common view that migration and prostitution explain the proportions the epidemic took there early on. This view supports recent epidemiological work demonstrating the importance of networks rather than behaviour in determining the scope of HIV epidemics. This sexual modernity has a complex genealogy that stretches back through the modernisation drive of the postcolonial state to colonial practices of government, including colonial strategies for containing tropical diseases, which shaped how Africans engaged with the modern world. As a result, sexuality became an important strategy for self-fashioning. With the advent of the economic crisis of the 1980s, sexuality became increasingly permeable to economic relations. Likewise, with the crisis, the city's therapeutic economy, heavily weighted towards the consumption of biomedicines, shifted resort for illness from the public health sector to the informal economy. This may have led to inappropriate treatment of sexually transmitted infections and increased re-use of needles, fuelling the epidemic further. Contemporary efforts to address the epidemic demonstrate how "bio-social" crystallizations can further effect social and biological change.

I demonstrate that theories dealing with self-determination based solely on human rights or cases of secession address the problem with inadequate tools. I also show that minority-rights approaches do not accommodate self-determination claims of national groups properly. I offer a new idea of nationhood as a political culture of self-determination with which people self-identify. It includes beliefs about co-nationals' mutual membership in a political community, which is perceived by them as having a self-determining power. Definitions of nationhood which use the notion of culture, but not political culture, are both too inclusive---they fail to distinguish between national and ethnic groups, and too exclusive---they overlook multicultural nations. Contested secession has received much attention in recent scholarship. Since, however, contested secession is based upon the disagreement of two or more national groups concerning their self-determination within particular boundaries, I consider secession within the scope of a systematic approach to the regulation of relations among national groups. I propose that international legal principles should be based upon the recognition of states and national groups as the two basic elements of the international system, and the equal recognition of nations as political cultures of self-determination. I interpret self-determination as a claim to equality within the boundaries a multinational state, and formulate a criterion of minimal justice for states. It requires that states respect equality of self-determination of national groups on their territory. National groups can secede from multinational states either by mutual agreement, or if their they are persistently denied a status with respect to self-determination equal to that of other national groups.</description><creator>Moltchanova, Anna.</creator><contributor>Davies, David (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Patten, Alan (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Weinstock, Daniel (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Nationalities, Principle of.</subject><subject>Self-determination, National.</subject><title>The basic principles of the international legal system and self-determination of national groups /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cr56n2793.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5d86p198p</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Philosophy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6682x566h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:46:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation presents a critical analysis of literary texts that recount fully or briefly the life and legend of King Numa Pompilius. Focusing on the 'Golden Age', it comprises the Numan accounts of Cicero, Livy, Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Ovid. These authors lived at a time when Rome was trying to reconcile for herself and for her subjects the price of her military world domination with the belief in her foreordained supremacy. This reconciliation was to be achieved by a reacquaintance with the Roman ancestral values whose observance had merited Rome her dominion and whose neglect had driven the state to civil war. The question of Roman national identity is at the heart of the Numan accounts of the chosen prose-writers. In his portrayal of Numa, who combines the civilizing virtues of classical Athens with native Roman virtue, Cicero offers a rebuttal for Greek critics who questioned Rome's supremacy because of her lack of civilizing virtues. Livy investigates the leading causes of Rome's world domination and identifies the national values and institutions that many generations of leaders forged. Numa is one such leader, having established laws, religious rite and a peaceful way of life. Dionysius represents Numa as the Greek ideal of kingship in order to establish for the Greek world the excellence of the Roman national identity founded on Greek virtue. The Numan accounts of Livy and Dionysius, composed in Augustus' principate, do not draw direct parallels between Numa and Augustus, although the narration sometimes suggests a special relevance to Augustan rule. Finally, Ovid, the only poet, recounting traditional Numan tales, offers analogies and allegories of certain Augustan ideas and measures that may be seen to flatter the ruler.</description><creator>Otis, Lise.</creator><contributor>Richardson, T.

But neither Shurayḥ nor his Kufan contemporaries left any books or written records. All information about the qaḍi comes in the form of traditions provided by the later generations of Muslim chroniclers. These traditions do not satisfy any standard of historical verifiability; they tell us primarily and reliably only about what those later generations thought important to say about, or in the name of, Shurayḥ. This is, nonetheless, vital information, and its importance is defined in the thesis question: what can we, by examining the traditions about Shurayḥ, learn about the development of Islamic law? The traditions are categorized into the following typologies, each of which is analyzed in a separate chapter: (a) biographical traditions, (b) legal theory, (c) legal ethics and procedure, (d) substantive law, (e) Shi`a juridical traditions. The analysis of the biographical traditions reveals that quite early after Shurayḥ's death---estimated at sometime between 76/695 and 99/718, he had evolved into a hazy figure. In addition to providing a response to the thesis question, the conclusion seeks to answer some other questions, among them: why did Shurayḥ, who was not the legal reasoner par excellence of his time, metamorphose into an aretological figure? Why did the Kufans seek to back-project his appointment to the time of `Umar? Based on the evidence, it is concluded that in Kufan imagery, Shurayḥ's legal opinions were deemed as valid as those of a Companion, and he personified the Kufan authority of "pastness."</description><creator>Mohammed, Khaleelul Iqbal.</creator><contributor>Hallaq, Wael (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Shurayḥ ibn al-Ḥārith al-Kindī, 7th cent.</subject><subject>Judges (Islamic law)</subject><subject>Hadith -- Authorities.</subject><title>Development of an archetype : studies in the Shurayḥ traditions</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9g54xk26n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cn69m569m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Islamic Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6q182m882</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:46:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>'Sola gratia' is the core of 'spiritual childhood' for Therese of Lisieux (1873--1897) as an existential theology centered on the redemptive work of God. This theological aspect is shared both by Therese's spirituality and by Dietrich Bonhoeffer's (1906--1945) theology. This study offers for the first time a comparison between their thought, mainly with regard to the Lutheran doctrine of justification by faith, analysed through the notion of kenosis and the question of otherness. The first part (chapters 1 to 3) is more philosophical. It deals with Bonhoeffer's theology in its early stage and analyses his debate with Erich Przywara (1889--1972) concerning the 'analogy of being' ('analogia entis'). The second part (chapters 4 and 5) expatiates on the proper basis for the comparison between Bonhoeffer and Therese offered by the notion of kenosis (chapter 4) and by the communicative structure of faith experience (chapter 5). This part is the pivotal one, from the first phase of Bonhoeffer's theology---his discussion with Przywara's philosophical and theological endeavour---to the second and third phases of Bonhoeffer's theology then compared to Therese's spirituality. The third part (chapters 6 to 9) deals with the kenotic structure common to Bonhoeffer and Therese, and basic for a genuine understanding of justification by faith. Justification by faith is thus the unifying aspect of this study, whose three-parts structure reflects the evolution of Bonhoeffer's theology traditionally divided up in three different periods. This study deepens the way Bonhoeffer understands otherness and the shifted emphasis in his thinking from the subject/object scheme, through otherness as exteriority, and finally to otherness as interiority. The many cultural and thematic differences between the Roman-Catholic nun and the Lutheran pastor are being taken into account, along with the common elements central to their thinking. The emphasis on the kenotic structure sheds light on questions never asked in theresian studies so far, e.g. the relationship between 'faith' and 'works'. Through the gratuitousness of redemption implied in justification and in sanctification as well, Therese's teaching and Bonhoeffer's theology are on the same line: the freeing of the self does imply the conformation to Christ's kenotic existence. This study pertains to the following three major concerns: oecumenical (doctrine of justification by faith), philosophical (otherness), and spiritual (authentic self-accomplishment). This study offers a polyphonic analysis pertaining to issues christological (kenosis), theological (grace and freedom), and spiritual (maturity in faith). Thus, it shows how theological discourse can be developed in a new way mainly with regard to the anthropological foundation of spiritual experience and the relevance of it for systematic theology; this cannot be achieved without a more critical use of the philosophical argumentation in theology.</description><creator>Destrempes, Sylvain.</creator><contributor>Boutin, Maurice (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Bonhoeffer, Dietrich, 1906-1945.</subject><subject>Thérèse, de Lisieux, Saint, 1873-1897.</subject><title>Kenose et alterite : Therese de Lisieux et Dietrich Bonhoeffer</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xs55md50h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6q182m882</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Religious Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7s75df19q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:46:14Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Comprehension of global oceanic currents and, ultimately, of climate variability requires the use of computer modelling. Although much effort has been spent on the accuracy of traditional finite difference (FD) models used in ocean modelling, there are still concerns, especially since these models have a crude representation of the geometry of oceanic basins. Such a crude representation may influence the accuracy of modelling boundary currents, or unrealisticly represent the impinging of eddies or the propagation of Kelvin waves along the coastline. This motivated the use of alternative modelling techniques applied on completely irregular geometries such as finite element (FE) and spectral element (SE) methods. In this thesis, we want to investigate the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of these three numerical methods in irregular domains and to understand to which extent the unstructured grid FE and SE methods constitute an improvement over the more traditional FD methods. To accomplish this, we limit ourselves to modelling the shallow water equations in presence of irregular coastlines with no bottom topography. In the first part of the thesis, we compare the performances of FD methods on Cartesian grids with FE and SE methods in various geometries for linear and non-linear applications. We argue that the SE method is to a certain extent superior to FD methods. In a second part, we study the influence of step-like walls on vorticity budgets for wind-driven shallow water FD models. We show that vorticity budgets can be very sensitive to the FD formulation. This has certain implications for using vorticity budgets as a diagnostic tool in FD models. In the final part, we use a SE shallow water model for investigating the "inertial runaway problem" in irregular domains for the single-gyre Munk problem. Ideally, one would like the statistical equilibrium observed at large Reynolds number to be insensitive to model choices that are not well founded, e.g., the precise value of the viscous coefficient, and choice of dynamic boundary condition. Simple models of geophysical flows are indeed very sensitive to these choices. For example, flows typically converge to unrealisticly strong circulations, particularly under free-slip boundary conditions, even at rather modest Reynolds numbers. This is referred to as the "inertial runaway problem". We show that the addition of irregular coastlines to the canonical problem helps to slow considerably the circulation, but does not prevent runway.</description><creator>Dupont, Frederic.</creator><contributor>Lin, Charles (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Straub, David (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Physical Oceanography.</subject><title>Comparison of numerical methods for modelling ocean circulation in basins with irregular coasts</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x059c9195.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7s75df19q</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gq67js85b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:46:14Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Mixed integer programming (MIP) provides an important modeling and decision support tool for a wide variety of real-life problems. Unfortunately, practical MIPs are large-scale in size and pose serious difficulties to the available solution methodology and software. This thesis presents a novel solution approach for large-scale mixed integer programming that integrates three bodies of research: interior point methods, decomposition techniques and branch-and-bound approaches. The combination of decomposition concepts and branch-and-bound is commonly known as branch-and-price, while the integration of decomposition concepts and interior point methods lead to the analytic centre cutting plane method (ACCPM). Unfortunately, the use of interior point methods within branch-and-bound methods could not compete with simplex based branch-and-bound due to the inability of "warm" starting. The motivation for this study stems from the success of branch-and-price and ACCPM in solving integer and non-differentiable optimization problems respectively and the quest for a method that efficiently integrates interior-point methods and branch-and-bound. The proposed approach is called an Interior Point Branch-and-Price method (IP-B&amp;P) and works as follows. First, a problem's structure is exploited using Lagrangean relaxation. Second, the resulting master problem is solved using ACCPM. Finally, the overall approach is incorporated within a branch-and-bound scheme. The resulting method is more than the combination of three different techniques. It addresses and fixes complications that arise as a result of this integration. This includes the restarting of the interior-point methods, the branching rule and the exploitation of past information as a warm start. In the first part of the thesis, we give the details of the interior-point branch-and-price method. We start by providing, discussing and implementing new ideas within ACCPM, then detail the IP-B&amp;P method and its different components. To show the practical applicability of IP-B&amp;P, we use the method as a basis for a new solution methodology for the production-distribution system design (PDSD) problem in supply chain management. In this second part of the thesis, we describe a two-level Lagrangean relaxation heuristic for the PDSD. The numerical results show the superiority of the method in providing the optimal solution for most of the problems attempted.</description><creator>Elhedhli, Samir.</creator><contributor>Goffin, Jean-Louis (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Integer programming.</subject><subject>Mathematical optimization.</subject><title>Interior-point decomposition methods for integer programming : theory and application</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6w924d371.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gq67js85b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Management</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2b88qd79z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:46:14Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Although there has been increased understanding of the dynamics of intense perfectionism and self-criticism, studies need to address more directly the mechanisms or processes through which perfectionism has its ill effects. The present research examined the roles of daily stress, coping, and perceived social support in the relation between two different perfectionism dimensions and distress symptoms (i.e., depression, anxiety, negative affect, low positive affect). In two studies, confirmatory factor analysis supported the existence of two perfectionism factors, which were referred to as evaluative concerns perfectionism and personal standards perfectionism. In Study One, university students (136 men; 307 women) completed measures of perfectionism, hassles, coping, perceived social support, depression, and anxiety. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the measurement model used in this study. Structural equation modeling indicated that hassles, avoidant coping, and perceived social support were each unique mediators which together fully explained the strong relation between evaluative concerns perfectionism and distress. Personal standards perfectionism had a unique association with active coping only. Hassles and social support also moderated the relation between both dimensions of perfectionism and distress. Study Two examined daily event appraisals, avoidant coping, and perceived social support as trait mediators in the relation between the evaluative concerns dimension of perfectionism and high negative affect and low positive affect. University students (66 men; 104 women) completed questionnaires at the end of the day for seven consecutive days.

The models account for the compositional buoyancy of the crustal layers by considering lithospheric plates that consist of a low-density crustal layer and a high-density mantle part. They also allow the basalt-eclogite phase change in the subducted oceanic crust. Two sets of kinematic and dynamic plate models are studied. In the kinematic models, the flow is driven by an imposed surface velocity, and rigid lithospheric plates are generated by adopting temperature-dependent viscosity. In the dynamic models, the buoyancy forces due to internal density variations provide the driving force of convection, and temperature, depth, and stress-dependent viscosity is used to achieve uniform plate motion. The results of the kinematic models show that the subduction of the continental crust is strongly controlled by the imposed surface velocity and the lithospheric viscosity. For most models with realistic rheologies, the continental lithosphere subducts to lower mantle depths as a coherent layer. Crustal detachment occurs only when crust-mantle coupling is weak. In such a case the mantle lithosphere continues its descent, while the crust detaches at depths &lt;150 km and accumulates at the top. In contrast, the dynamic models show that continental convergence results in crust-mantle detachment in the subducting plate and crustal thickening in both subducting and overriding plates. The depth of detachment ranges from 100 to 170 km. As the thickness of the crust increases, the convergence velocity in the collision zone decreases and the location of subduction gradually shifts toward the interior of the subducting plate. In models with greater viscosity, the subducting mantle lithosphere maintains its integrity and does not break up. In models with weaker rheology, the positive buoyancy of the thickened crust can overcome the strength of the subducting lithosphere, and subsequently a state of tensional stress develops in the upper part of the slab that ultimately causes the oceanic slab to break off and sink into the mantle. The breakoff occurs over a time interval of 10 to 20 m.y. (depending on plate velocity), which is roughly the time needed for the crust to reach its maximum thickness. The models indicate no rapid asthenospheric upflow and related heating of the base of the crust as a consequence of slab breakoff. Crustal detachment takes place over a wide range of lithospheric strength values, suggesting that in the dynamic models crustal buoyancy has an important role in the dynamics of continental subduction.</description><creator>Sobouti, Farhad.</creator><contributor>Arkani-Hamed, Jafar (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Geophysics.</subject><title>Thermo-mechanical modeling subduction of continental lithosphere</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kk91fn38x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v405sb944</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zp38wf46j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:46:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The aim of this thesis is to examine where in the human brain sensory and affective processing of taste takes place. Two patient studies and two neuroimaging studies were performed. Taste intensity perception was evaluated in patients with unilateral resection from the AMTL, and in healthy control subjects. The results from two independent experiments indicate that AMTL removal leads to taste intensity perception changes, including decreases in the accuracy of judging actual concentrations of taste solutions, and increases in the perceived intensities of an aversive bitter taste. It is possible that the latter result reflects a potentiation of the aversiveness of bitter as opposed to, or in addition to a change in intensity perception of taste intensity alone. To define more precisely the regions of the insula/operculum and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) {putative primary and secondary gustatory regions (PGA and SGA, respectively)} that are activated by gustatory stimulation in humans, standardized Talairach coordinates from all available studies were compiled and plotted onto an averaged MRI image. As in non-human primates, it is likely that the human PGA is represented in several regions within the middle to anterior insula, and in frontal and parietal opercula. The precise location of the human SGA is less clear, but is likely within the caudal region of the OFC. In the final study, successive [15O]H2O PET scans were performed on volunteers as they ate chocolate to beyond satiety. Thus, the sensory stimulus was held constant while its reward value was manipulated by feeding. As predicted, modulation was observed in both the primary and secondary gustatory regions, corresponding to the regions identified in the previous study. This finding suggests overlapping representation of sensory and affective processing of taste in humans. Additionally, different groups of structures were selectively recruited depending on whether subjects were eating chocolate when they were highly motivated to eat or highly motivated not to eat. In summary, the work contained within this thesis suggests that sensory and affective processing of taste occurs in the AMTL, PGA, and SGA.

The usual etiology is a primary defect in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), where the severity of impairment is presumably linked to the ratio of mutant to wild-type mtDNA. This dissertation presents novel therapeutic approaches to these genetic defects, aimed at attenuating mitochondrial dysfunction and ameliorating the clinical condition by employing exercise training alone or in conjunction with pharmacological therapy. Dichloroacetate (DCA) was administered to augment mitochondrial capacity by activating pyruvate dehydrogenase, thereby decreasing lactic acidosis. Endurance and resistance training paradigms were employed to induce mitochondrial and satellite cell proliferation respectively. The goals were to augment respiratory chain function, increase levels of wild type mtDNA, and reverse effects of chronic inactivity. The effects of these treatments on functional and mitochondrial capacity were defined by changes in: (1) work capacity, oxygen utilization, and circulatory responses during maximal exercise; (2) heart rate and blood lactate during submaximal exercise; (3) recovery kinetics of phosphate-containing metabolites measured using phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 31P MRS); (4) scores on a quality of life questionnaire. The cellular correlates for these indices were defined by changes in: (1) mitochondrial volume, (2) respiratory chain enzyme activity, and (3) levels of mutant/wild-type mtDNA. Although DCA administration alone lowered blood lactate, endurance training was more effective in improving exercise capacity, heart rate and blood lactate, 31P MRS recovery kinetics, and quality of life. Increased mitochondrial volume and respiratory chain function were closely linked</description><creator>Taivassalo, Tanja.</creator><contributor>Arnold, Douglas L.

There are two main objectives of the study: (1) to look at why the organizational forms of the collection of groups evolved as they did; (2) to examine the outcomes and effectiveness of these organizational forms for CAS and its member organizations. Interviews were conducted with founding members of CAS and later staff and activists. Members of a subsection of local General Service Organizations (GSOs) were interviewed regarding group relationships to CAS and involvement with other organizations in their communities. Documentary research on materials produced by CAS (now publicly available in the AIDS Committee of Toronto library) was carried out. Some documentation was also available for local organizations. The Globe and Mail index was used to research CAS national level work. This dissertation uses the concepts network, coalition and umbrella organization to develop an understanding of why CAS formalized and the positive and negative outcomes of this for member groups and the organization itself. The issues of insider/outsider organization, motivation, identity, framing and ideology are discussed in relation to their impact on both CAS and a subsection of member organizations. CAS developed as a network, coalition, and umbrella organization. This evolution was in response to the purpose and goals of CAS at a national level, Ottawa based representative of member organizations interacting with the government and gathering and producing information useful to local work. CAS became increasingly formalized over the period under study, seeking and gaining access to government and other elites, as at least a semi-insider organization.</description><creator>Steele, Derek G.</creator><contributor>Staggenborg, Suzanne (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Canadian AIDS Society.</subject><subject>AIDS (Disease) -- Canada.</subject><title>The evolution of the Canadian AIDS Society : a social movement organization as network, coalition and umbrella organization</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tx31qk407.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j3860859r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Sociology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jd472z18b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:46:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Using counselling sessions conducted by ten "master therapists" (e.g., Rogers, Ellis, Perls) from four different schools of psychotherapy, the present study investigated relationships between four variables: Client experiencing, emotional arousal/expression, productive client in-session behaviours, and therapist interventions. High levels of client experiencing occurred in significantly different proportions across schools in the sample, and had significantly different interactions with clients' productive in-session behaviours across the four schools studied. Likewise, admixtures of client experiencing and strong emotional arousal occurred to significantly different proportions across schools, and these admixtures also had significantly different interactions with clients' productive in-session behaviours across the four schools. These findings demonstrate that clients' productive in-session behaviours are not uniformly facilitated by high levels of experiencing across all schools. Next, across schools, therapist interventions of low structure were found to be significantly more associated with subsequent high levels of client experiencing than were interventions of moderate or high structure. However, loglinear analysis indicated that this association varied across schools, suggesting that the same therapist interventions had different in-session outcomes in different schools. The same three interventions were most likely to be followed by high experiencing in all schools: Reflection, interpretation, and provision of information. The common factors implications of this finding are discussed. Finally, in order to take in-session context into account, a second study examined in-session episodes that represented different experiencing/emotional arousal conditions. Two clinically experienced judges rated 23 aspects of the in-session process (i.e., therapist tasks, client tasks, client focus, and quality of episodes) of 24 such different episodes. Only one aspect emerged as significant: When working with clients at high levels of Experiencing, but without strong emotional arousal levels, therapists were significantly more likely to identify clients' underlying affect than in the other two Experiencing/emotional arousal episode types. No other significant differences were found in the therapist or clients' tasks, client focus, or quality of the different episodes. Several methodological directives are offered for future researchers employing a design similar to that of this second study.</description><creator>Rogan, Kieron.</creator><contributor>Stalikas, Anastassios (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Experiential psychotherapy.</subject><subject>Focused expressive psychotherapy.</subject><title>Experiencing and emotional expression in psychotherapy : an investigation of two in-session client processes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/df65v956n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jd472z18b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p5547t13b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:46:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study concerns the sources of the revolutionary Bolshevik elite's social and ethnic origins in Late Imperial Russia. The key finding is that the Bolshevik leadership of the revolutionary years 1917--1924 was highly ethnically diverse in origin with non-Russians---Jews, Latvians, Georgians, Armenians, Poles, Lithuanians, and Ukrainians---constituting nearly two-thirds of the elite. The 'Russian' Revolution was led primarily by elites of the empire's non-Russian national minorities. This thesis therefore considers the sources of their radicalism in the peripheries of the multinational empire. Although the 'class' language of socialism has dominated accounts not only of the causes of the Revolution but also of the sources of Bolshevik socialism, in my view the Bolsheviks were more a response to a variety of cultural, linguistic, religious, and ethnic social identities than they were a response to class conflict. The appeal of a theory about class conflict does not necessarily mean that it was class conflict to which the Bolsheviks were responding; they were much more a product of the tensions of a multi-ethnic imperial state than of the alienating 'class' effects of an industrializing Russian state. How 'peripherals' of the imperial borderlands came to espouse an ideology of the imperial 'center' is the empirical focus. Five substantive chapters on Jews, Poles and Lithuanians, Ukrainians, Transcaucasians, and Latvians, consider the sources of their radicalism by contextualizing their biographies in regional ethnopolitics and in relationships to the Tsarist state. A great attraction of Russian (Bolshevik) socialism was in what it meant for ethnopolitics in the multi-ethnic borderlands: much of the appeal lay in its secularism, its 'ecumenical' political vision, its universalism, its anti-nationalism, and in its implied commitment to "the good imperial ideal". The 'elective affinities' between individuals of different ethnic strata and Russian socialism varied across ethnic groups, and often within them. One of the key themes, therefore, is how a social and political identity is worked out within the context of a multinational empire, invoking social processes such as nationalism, assimilation, Russification, social mobility, access to provincial and imperial 'civil societies', linguistic and cultural choices, and ethnopolitical relationships.</description><creator>Riga, Liliana.</creator><contributor>Hall, John A.

In this thesis, counter to the current trend, I argue that the most explanatory approach to phonological processes requires reference to highly-articulated representations. I explore a number of phenomena found in the first language acquisition of Quebec French and argue that these phenomena are best captured in an analysis based on structurally-defined markedness, headedness in constituent structure, and relationships between segmental features and their prosodic licensors. I demonstrate that headedness in constituent structure must be assigned to both input and output forms. In order to encode the dependency relations between input and output representations, I appeal to faithfulness constraints referring specifically to constituent heads. Output representations are regulated by markedness constraints governing complexity within constituents, as well as by licensing relationships that hold between segmental features and different levels of prosodic representation. At all stages in the development of syllable structure and complex segments, when more than one option is available for the representation of a target string, children select the unmarked option, consistent with the long-held view that early grammars reflect what is unmarked. When input complex structures are reduced in children's outputs, reduction operates in order to ensure faithfulness to the content of prosodic and segmental heads. Finally, in the discussion of consonant harmony, where the French data are supplemented by examples from English, I propose that consonant harmony results from a licensing relation between segmental features and the head of the foot. The differences in foot structure between French and English enable us to account for the contrasts observed between learners of the two languages.</description><creator>Rose, Yvan.</creator><contributor>Goad, Heather (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>French language -- Phonetics.</subject><subject>French language -- Acquisition.</subject><title>Headedness and prosodic licensing in the L1 acquisition of phonology</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tb09j7174.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g445cf98t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Linguistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8623j0533</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:46:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A Canada wide questionnaire survey collected data from 168 dietetics trainees and 23 preservice program coordinators regarding perceptions of preservice practice. First, to what extent were trainees and coordinators aware of and involved with the Competencies for the Entry Level Dietitian? Second, how prepared were trainees for practice? Third, what was the depth and breadth of learning opportunity in competencies of assessment, planning, implementation, and evaluation? Fourth, what were the number of learning opportunities in competencies of professional practice and communication? Further, did perceptions vary with format of preservice practice (integrated or internship) or respondent type (trainee or coordinator)? Results showed most trainees received a copy of the competencies and they were used in trainee evaluation, though only 60% of trainees were very familiar with them. Preparedness for practice was rated as sufficient for 25 (56%) of the 45 competencies. Eighty-eight (61%) of the 145 competencies and sub competencies were practiced in sufficient depth and breadth or number. Preparedness ratings were higher in integrated programs than internships. Agreement between coordinator and trainee perceptions was higher in integrated programs than internships. Problems identified were in certain areas of management, communication, monitoring and evaluation, and research. Comments received related to difficulty with comprehensibility of the competencies, their usefulness as a framework for guiding preservice practice, and problems associated with use in trainee evaluation; the sometimes lack of support and guidance for trainees; benefits of integrated programs; and the greater emphasis placed on clinical nutrition than on food service or community nutrition during the programs. Recommendations are given for dietetics educators.</description><creator>Rose-Lucas, Maureen E.</creator><contributor>McAlpine, L.
