The following work critically examines this body of literature and identifies problems associated with terminology use, construct definition and methodological procedures. As a way of providing an explanation for the insufficiently elaborated methodologies used in the empirical literature, it uses a data set similar to those used in other studies. Academics' responses to questions eliciting teaching conceptions are examined and categorized via qualitative thematic analysis. The resulting framework identifies statements of belief and knowledge that are embedded in conceptual responses.</description><creator>Jazvac, Marian.</creator><contributor>Saroyan, Alenoush (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Teachers -- Training of.</subject><subject>College teaching.</subject><title>Conceptions of teaching in higher education : challenges and recommendations</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/br86b511s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cj82k8978</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:r494vm775</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis I discuss personal identity (the self) as it relates to authoritative contexts (the sublime). I show how these contexts confer meaning on personal and cultural narratives, which in turn confer meaning on facts and knowledge claims. I outline three conceptions of the self and sublime (Richard Rorty's, Charles Taylor's and Robert Kegan's), and address the implications of these for education.

The Vh-ALDH differs from other aldehyde dehydrogenases in its high affinity for NADP+. The binding of NADP+ appears to arise from the interaction of the 2'-phosphate of the adenosine moiety of NADP+ with a threonine (T175) in the nucleotide recognition site just after the betaB strand. By mutation of this single threonine residue, the nucleotide specificity of Vh-ALDH has been changed from NADP+ to NAD+. The active site of Vh-ALDH contains the usual suspects of a cysteine (C289), two glutamates (E253 and E377) and an asparagine (N147) involved in the aldehyde dehydrogenase mechanism. However, Vh-ALDH has one polar residue in the active site that distinguishes it from other ALDHs; a histidine (H450) is in close contact with the cysteine nucleophile. As a glutamate has been implicated in promoting the nucleophilicity of the active site cysteine residue in ALDHs, the close contact of a histidine with the cysteine nucleophile in Vh-ALDH raises the possibility of alternate routes to increase the reactivity of the cysteine nucleophile. The effects of mutation of these residues on the different functions catalyzed by Vh-ALDH should help define the specific roles of the residues in the active site of ALDHs.</description><creator>Zhang, Lei, 1966-</creator><contributor>Meighen, E.

This topic was chosen due to two main reasons. First, it is a topic of great social relevance, particularly with regards to the issues of abortion, ensoulment and foetal rights. Second, it is a topic that has received scant scholarly attention. Indeed, we find that many scholars deal with issues related to the foetus such as inheritance, bequests and blood-money inter alia in their discussions of such issues. We do not find a work concentrating solely on the foetus, thereby gathering many rulings concerning it in a single oeuvre. Hence, given the current state of scholarship as well as the social relevance of the rulings concerning the foetus, this topic was chosen as the main theme of this thesis. This thesis explores the different tools utilized by jurists to arrive at these rulings. It tackles the issues of conception, ensoulment, abortion and gestation before proceeding to the rulings concerning the foetus' parentage, inheritance and blood-money. In doing so, it resorts to fiqh books from the four Sunni schools of law. It argues that the foetus was recognized as a "person" under the law and that great effort was extended towards securing many rights in its favour.</description><creator>Badr, Yasmine.</creator><contributor>Hallaq, W.

One-way functions form the basis of public-key cryptography. Although we have candidate hard problems that are believed to be one-way, none has been proven to be so. Therefore the security of the corresponding cryptographic schemes depends on the intractability assumptions of these problems. Two major species of such problems, factoring and discrete logarithm, are widely believed to be intractable, and serve as the basis of many popular schemes. However, these two problems turned out to be polynomial-time solvable on a hypothetical quantum computer using Shor's algorithm. This is the most worrisome long-term threat to current public-key cryptosystems. In the thesis we provide a review of existing cryptosystems, with a focus on their underlying computational assumptions and the security. Other than factoring and discrete logarithm, schemes have been proposed based on error-correcting codes, subset-sum and subset-product problems, lattice, polynomials, combinatorial group theory, number fields, etc. Many are to be furtherly evaluated in future research.</description><creator>Zhu, Hong, 1975-</creator><contributor>Crepeau, Claude (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Survey of computational assumptions used in cryptography broken or not by Shor's algorithm</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k0698928c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bz60cz26q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5999n506x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:35Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Julie Bruneau is characterized in many different ways in the Papineau family correspondence. The first-, second- and third-person narrators of the correspondence each use many techniques, some similar and some different, to emphasize various aspects of Julie's character. The study of the characterization achieved by the different narrative voices, as well as by the contrasting first-person voices in Julie's own letters, allows us to better understand the nature of epistolary characterization in all its forms. The comparison of these varying accounts of Julie Bruneau's character allows us to come to a more balanced and complete portrait than would the study of only one part of the correspondence.</description><creator>Arbach, Marla.</creator><contributor>Lamonde, Yvan (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>QuÃ©bec (Province) -- History -- 1841-1867.</subject><subject>Women -- QuÃ©bec (Province) -- Correspondence.</subject><subject>Papineau, Louis Joseph, 1786-1871 -- Correspondence.</subject><subject>Canada -- History -- Rebellion, 1837-1838.</subject><subject>Papineau, Julie, 1796-1862 -- Family -- Correspondence.</subject><subject>Papineau, Julie, 1796-1862 -- Correspondence.</subject><subject>Papineau family.</subject><title>Le personnage de Julie Bruneau dans la correspondance Papineau /</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5425kc422.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5999n506x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>DÃ©partement de langue et littÃ©rature franÃ§aises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7s75df34t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:35Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Objective. To compare the prognostic ability of first available measurements of CD4 cell count and viral load with that of the most recent measurements and to assess the additional prognostic ability of the values of past measurements of these markers. Methods. Demographic and clinical information on 965 HIV-1 infected adults followed at a university-based HIV clinic in Montreal, Quebec were extracted from a clinical database. The prognostic ability of initial and most recent CD4 cell count and viral load measurements were assessed in a series of Cox models. The added prognostic ability of past values of measurements of these markers was explored by calculating; (i) the unweighted mean values of all previous measurements and (ii) a time-weighted mean. The differences between these mean levels and the most recent values were included as time-dependent covariates in Cox models adjusted for the value of the most recent measurements. Conclusion. The most recent measurements of CD4 cell count and viral load are more powerful predictors of clinical disease progression than initial measurements.

The degree of metal complexation by organic acids depends on the type, concentration, metal type, pH and temperature. The influence of pH, temperature on the extraction efficiency of lead, zinc and copper was evaluated using Sodium citrate and sodium acetate buffers. Sodium citrate buffer was selected for the soil treatment. The soil was characterized for its pH, total metal content and the distribution of target heavy metals in soil fractions. Optimal conditions for Pb extraction with 0.5M citrate buffer was used to treat soil in batches and in columns, to evaluate their extraction efficiency and possible use for in-situ remediation. Chitosan, a derivative of chitin is a versatile biopolymer with metal uptake capabilities. Due to the large amounts of chitosan required to treat heavily contaminated leachates, magnesium (Mg) and iron (Fe) metals granules were evaluated for stripping the heavy metals from solution before the use of chitosan at optimized conditions to effectively polish the soil washing.

Mother's mean hemoglobin (Hb) was 12.4 +/- 1.3 g/dL with 32% anemia (Hb &lt; 12g/dL). Retinol in serum was 49.8 +/- 13.2 mug/dL and 66.0 mug/dL (median) in breast milk; no evidence of sub-clinical VAD. Infants, 62% â¤ 3 months, had mean Hb of 10.9 +/- 1.1 g/dL (with anemia present (&lt;11g/dL), in 50%). Mean infant serum retinol was 26.9 +/- 7.2 mug/dL (10% prevalence of marginal VAD). No infants were exclusively breastfed. Weaning foods and breast milk substitutes were introduced early and infant intake of traditional medicines was common (52%). Our data suggest that anemia was present in both mothers and infants while VAD was evident only in infants. This early occurrence of micronutrient deficiencies may be attributed to less than optimal breastfeeding practices.</description><creator>Sibeko, Lindiwe N.</creator><contributor>Gray-Donald, K.

The model shows that structural elements essential for binding guanine nucleotides are conserved. (M.t.)EF1-A protein was purified to homogeneity using a combination of immobilized metal ion affinity and HPLC size exclusion chromatography. The protein specifically binds to guanine nucleotides and exhibits nucleotide exchange rates that give values between 4.6 and 6.5 x 10-3 s-1. The solution structure of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum elongation factor-1Balpha, (M.t.)EF1-Balpha, was determined by NMR spectroscopy. Analysis of the structure reveals an alphabeta superfold that is commonly found in RNA binding proteins. The 3-D architecture of (M.t.)EF1-Balpha is similar to analogous domains catalyzing nucleotide exchange in human, yeast and bacterial proteins within the translation elongation family.</description><creator>Siddiqui, Nadeem.</creator><contributor>Gehring, Kalle (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><title>Characterization of elongation factor 1-A &amp; 1-B from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/12579v02x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vh53wx571</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3j333275x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, resulted in  dramatic legal changes in the U.S. As part of its investigation into the attacks,  the U.S. Government detained approximately 5,000 "aliens" from  predominantly Muslim countries. These detentions were characterized by minimal, and  sometimes non-existent, habeas corpus and due-process protections. During times of  crisis, care should be taken that panic not be allowed to prevail over  long-cherished constitutional values. This thesis examines Government actions in  light of constitutional principles to examine the larger question of whether the War  on Terror detention practices have permanently undermined the rule of law in the  U.S. The factual and legal scenarios in this area have been changing  at a rapid rate, and they will certainly continue to change. Those constant changes  have presented a special challenge in writing this thesis. The facts and legal  scenarios described herein, therefore, are current as of January 31,  2005.</description><creator>Duffy, Maureen T.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Emigration and immigration law -- United States</subject><subject>Detention of persons -- United States</subject><subject>Constitutional law -- United States</subject><subject>Rule of law -- United States</subject><subject>Terrorism -- United States -- Prevention</subject><title>The U.S. immigration detentions in the war on terror : impact on the rule of law</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c821gk41f.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3j333275x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gh93h0020</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Merger review has gained in importance in both Canada and the  European Union since the enactment of the Competition Act in 1986 and the Merger  Regulation in 1989 respectively. The increase in international trade and the  globalization of the world economy have forced both jurisdictions to reform the  relevant provisions of their Competition law as concerns mergers in order to keep  pace with these rapid changes. The thesis offers a thorough description of the current merger  review laws in both systems, and the proposed amendments under consideration in  Canada and the EU. In the last chapter, the author compares both procedures and  comes to the conclusion that, notwithstanding certain differences in objectives and  perception, merger regulation in both systems seems to flow along the same lines.  Canada does, however, hold a (lonely) special position as far as the 'efficiency  defence' is concerned.</description><creator>Curfs, Steven Willem</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Consolidation and merger of corporations -- European Union countries</subject><subject>Consolidation and merger of corporations -- Canada</subject><title>A comparative analysis of the regulation of mergers in Canada and the European Union /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ft848r11x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gh93h0020</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0z708x04q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Le regime juridique instaure par le legislateur quebecois en  matiere de consentement aux soins pour le majeur inapte merite d'etre revise.

L'auteur conclut que l'objectif vise par le legislateur quebecois, le respect de la  personne, n'est que partiellement atteint.</description><creator>Lecoq, Nathalie</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Conservatorships -- QuÃ©bec (Province).</subject><subject>Mental health laws -- QuÃ©bec (Province)</subject><subject>Capacity and disability -- QuÃ©bec (Province).</subject><subject>Informed consent (Medical law) -- QuÃ©bec (Province).</subject><title>Ãvaluation critique du rÃ©gime juridique quÃ©bÃ©cois en matiÃ¨re de consentement aux soins pour le majeur inapte</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z890rt936.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0z708x04q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7w62f874m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Is it an activity qualified as torture only when it is carried  out for certain purposes? At the heart of the debate lies the question of whether or  not corporal punishment is a form of torture. Aspects of corporal punishment remain  acceptable according certain religious traditions. An example of this is found in  traditional Islamic law, which has banned both torture and other cruel, inhuman and  degrading treatment or punishment, when used for the express purpose of obtaining  confessions or information. In other circumstances, however, severe corporal  punishment is acceptable in Islamic law. As a result, some Islamic states whose  domestic law is rooted in traditional Islamic law, justify their use of torture by  invoking Islamic traditions: they claim that corporal punishment is derived from  God's will. These states tend to consider its use as lawful sanctions, and it is  made legal under their domestic law. In this paper, Iran is studied as one such  state.</description><creator>Mokhtari, Ali</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Torture (International law)</subject><subject>Human rights -- Iran</subject><subject>Islamic law -- Iran.</subject><subject>Human rights</subject><subject>Law -- Iran.</subject><subject>Torture.</subject><subject>Torture -- Iran.</subject><title>Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3x816n083.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7w62f874m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2801pg77q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The thesis focuses on the branding phenomenon in its  relationship with territory. Owners of global brands seek to defend a set of  positive associations that goes beyond the concept of trademark per se. In that  undertaking, the territorial limitation of trademark rights is perceived as an  impediment to a worldwide protection of the branded myth. The thesis analyses the branding phenomenon and the  territoriality principle of trademark law. It also depicts the methods currently  employed by trademark owners to circumvent national legislations. The thesis  supports alternative approaches, which successfully combine branding and territorial  values. Eventually, the conflict of applying domestic law to  "universal" trademarks can be solved by an adequate use of the global  branding notion and through the establishment or strengthening of relevant regional  blocks.</description><creator>Le PÃ©ru, Alexandre</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Brand name products -- Management</subject><subject>Conflict of laws -- Trademarks</subject><title>Branding and territories : the conflict of applying domestic laws to universal trademarks</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d791sg87p.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2801pg77q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cr56n170d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Public debt incurred by developing countries has become an  ardently debated issue in international relations. The competing interests of  creditors and debtors, combined with the increasing necessity of advancing welfare  worldwide, make it difficult to establish a workable scheme that provides adequate  assistance to needy countries. Foreign aid is evidently part of the solution to  development problems. However, conditions imposed by international lenders bring  about certain discontents. The World Bank's negative pledge clause forbids a public  borrower from securing external debt that is preferential to that of the Bank. This  covenant also includes several exceptions: short-term secured banking transactions  and financing, through the transfer of state-owned assets, are allowed. Moreover,  only in exceptional circumstances does the Bank waive the clause's application.  Thus, in order to secure foreign debt, a borrowing government is usually forced to  contract financing that falls within the covenant's exceptions. This Paper analyzes the World Bank's negative pledge clause and  compares it to the provisions used in commercial lending. It also reviews the  historical tendencies and current trends with respect to sovereign borrowing, and  concludes that the World Bank's negative pledge clause should be amended, in order  to bring it closer to commercial practice. It is argued that the amendments proposed  in this thesis will enhance the Bank's dual function and role as both a creditor and  a development institution.</description><creator>Chmielewski, Maciej</creator><date>2005</date><subject>World Bank</subject><subject>Debts, External</subject><subject>Pledges (Law)</subject><title>How to improve the effectiveness of the World Bank's negative pledge clause as a legal and policy instrument</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6969z138n.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cr56n170d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5d86p089h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In mixed pool/bilateral electricity markets, participants can  sign bilateral contracts several weeks or months in advance of the pool  market-clearing. Any uncommitted generator capacity may be sold to the pool and any  remaining un-serviced demand is met through the pool, both at the pool spot  price. In this thesis, in contrast to financial rights, we consider  only physical bilateral contracts, where the generator and load are obliged to  produce and consume power levels at least equal to the stipulated bilateral  amount. Bilateral contracts have the advantage that they satisfy at  least part of the needs of both buyers and sellers at a predictable price instead of  relying solely on the uncertain real-time spot price at the pool market-clearing  time. However the risk of signing a bilateral contract is that it commits the  partners to a price that may be disadvantageous compared to the pool spot price.  Thus, if the spot price turns out to be lower than the bilateral price, then the  seller comes out ahead while the buyer loses compared to the alternative of having  traded solely in the real-time market. Conversely, if the spot price turns out to be  higher than the bilateral price, then the seller loses out while the buyer benefits  compared to having traded solely in the real-time market. Here we propose a systematic bilateral negotiating approach  between a generator and load in mixed pool/bilateral markets. Under this approach  the generator and load respond rationally to a stream of bilateral bids/counter-bids  and offers/counter-offers considering their respective expected benefits while  accounting for the risks incurred by the uncertainty of pool spot price prediction.  This negotiating approach is tested numerically and shown to be a valuable and  practical tool in arriving at a mutually beneficial and risk-tolerable bilateral  contract.</description><creator>El Khatib, Sameh</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>An iterative approach to negotiating bilateral contracts in mixed pool/bilateral electricity markets /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fq977v41d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5d86p089h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p2676w15f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Kraft recovery boiler capacity limitations can be alleviated by  using wet air oxidation (WAO) to treat excess kraft black liquor. The WAO process  can be described as the liquid phase oxidation of organic and oxidizable inorganic  components at elevated temperatures (125ÂºC to 320ÂºC) and pressures  (0.5 MPa to 20.0 MPa) using a gaseous source of oxygen. In an attempt to improve the degree of oxidation of kraft black  liquor, the use of different heterogeneous metal oxide catalysts was investigated.  Experiments were carried out in a stainless steel batch reactor using pure oxygen.  Screening experiments showed that cupric oxide (CuO) considerably improved the  overall degree of oxidation. When using this catalyst a 71.6% reduction in the  chemical oxygen demand occurred compared to a 45.9% reduction when no catalyst was  used. Further experiments were performed to study the effect of oxygen charging  pressure, temperature, and reaction time.</description><creator>Duarte, Daniel</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Catalytic wet air oxidation of spent Kraft pulping liquors</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gx41mj590.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p2676w15f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pc289j52c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The capability to perform dexterous operations in an autonomous  manner would greatly enhance the productivity of space robotic operations. In the  present thesis, we address this problem and propose a new methodology for  vision-guided automatic grasping using SARAH, a three-fingered robotic hand. The  Canadian Space Agency is planning to install SARAH on the International Space  Station and we developed a methodology allowing this robotic hand to grasp objects  autonomously by using a vision system in combination with an off-line grasp  planner. More specifically, a new algorithm for synthesizing  force-closure grasps for planar and revolute objects with SARAH is formulated. The  grasp synthesis explicitly takes into account the hand geometry constraints and  optimizes several grasp quality criteria simultaneously. Subsequently, a  vision-based approach for object pose identification is presented. A vision system  incorporating a monocular camera mounted in the center of SARAH's palm was designed.  Color information taken from a region of interest in the image and color indexing  are used to locate the object in the scene. The virtual images predicting the  appearance of the object are utilized for pose identification. The complete  methodology is practical, ensures high quality grasps and provides an intuitive tool  for automatic grasping. Numerical results are presented for grasp synthesis of several  objects with SARAH. These demonstrate the feasibility and optimality of the  synthesized grasps, as well as the completeness and correctness of the methodology.  Experiments were also conducted with SARAH as the end-effector of a  7-Degree-of-Freedom robot and vision-guided automatic grasping was  achieved.</description><creator>Boivin, Eric</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Vision-guided automatic grasping using SARAH</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jq085k67v.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pc289j52c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:00000056v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Stretch reflex excitability was measured during quiet standing  by using a bilateral electro-hydraulic actuator to apply perturbations of angular  position to the ankle. Subjects were instructed to stand quietly while pulse  displacements were applied at random times. Position, torque, gastrocnemius-soleus  EMG, tibialis anterior EMG, heel position, tibia angle, femur angle, and sacrum  angle were measured. Background torque and reflex excitability varied substantially  from trial to trial---reflex torque decreased as the background torque level  increased; while reflex EMG increased when background torque increased. This  behavior is consistent with previous findings in prone subjects. Reflex torque for a  given activation level was found to vary with the initial torque derivative---reflex  excitation was greater for negative torque derivatives than their positive  counterparts. These findings suggest that reflex excitability in quiet human  standing is modulated to optimize balance.</description><creator>Bock, Przemek John</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</subject><title>Modulation of stretch reflex excitability in quiet human standing</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pz50gw768.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/00000056v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biomedical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:df65v847g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is North America's leading killer  for both men and women among all racial and ethnic groups. Almost 1 million North  Americans die of CVD each year, which adds up to 42% of all deaths. Numerous investigations point out that normal blood flow  (hemodynamics) is essential to good health and many studies found that there is a  relationship between the genesis and the progression of CVD with the locally  irregular blood flow occurring in the diseased zones. The study of hemodynamics in the cardiovascular system is  therefore key to the understanding of CVD; its genesis and  progression. The aorta is the largest artery in the body, rising from the  heart's major pumping chamber, the left ventricle. It is the primary artery of the  circulatory system, delivering oxygenated blood to all other arteries except those  of the lungs and is a major site for CVD. Despite the clinical importance of the aorta, relatively little  is known about its hemodynamic features due in part to the difficulty of studying  blood flow in this artery. This thesis presents a numerical analysis on the hemodynamics of  a 3D realistic model of the human aorta and its arch reconstructed from Magnetic  Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. The objective was to evaluate the effect of flow waveform and  inlet flow velocity profile on the hemodynamics in the proximal, medial, distal  regions of the aorta and on the hemodynamics in the branches.</description><creator>Biadillah, Youssef</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</subject><title>Hemodynamics of an anatomically realistic human aorta</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n583xv51j.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/df65v847g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2801pg780</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis reports the results of an investigation of scorodite  long-term solubility and stability conducted at fixed pH (5-9) and temperature  (22Â°C, 50Â°C and 75Â°C). The decomposition of scorodite at  22Â°C was found to be extremely slow. At neutral pH, the arsenic  concentration stabilized at 5.8 mg/L. As scorodite dissolved, the iron  reprecipitated as 2-line ferrihydrite. The growth and re-crystallization of  ferrihydrite was delayed by apparent arsenate adsorption. The solubility product of  scorodite was calculated as 10-25.5. The dissolution rate of scorodite in a pure  system was modeled with a decreasing exponential equation. The pre-exponential  factor approached first order vis-a-vis OH- concentration and the activation energy  suggested that scorodite dissolution is chemically controlled. A thermodynamic  investigation indicated that the stability field of scorodite extends up to pH 6.75  for a molality of the aqueous species of 6.7x10 -5 (5 mg/L As) when in equilibrium  with ferrihydrite but only up to pH 2.3 when in equilibrium with goethite. The  presence of gypsum led to lower arsenic concentrations; this was attributed to the  formation of calcium-iron-arsenate compounds, such as yukonite (Ca2Fe3(AsO4)  4(OH)Â·12H2O).</description><creator>Bluteau, Marie-Claude</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</subject><title>The incongruent dissolution of scorodite-solubilities, kinetics and mechanisms /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j9602117h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2801pg780</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8623hz25j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The importance of host factors in determining susceptibility to  systemic Candida albicans infections is evident in both humans and mice. We have  used a mouse model to study the genetic basis of susceptibility, using the inbred  strains A/J and C57BL/6J, which are susceptible and resistant to infection,  respectively, based on different parameters of response to infection. To identify  genes responsible for this differential host response, brain and kidney fungal load  were measured in 128 [A/J x C57BL/6J]F 2 mice 48 hours after infection with 5x104 C.  albicans blastospores. Segregation analysis in this informative population  identified complement component 5 (C5/Hc) as the major gene responsible for this  differential susceptibility (LOD of 22.7 for kidney, 19.0 for brain), with a  naturally-occurring mutation that causes C5 deficiency leading to enhanced  susceptibility. C5 was also found to control heart fungal load, survival time, and  serum TNF-alpha levels during infection. Investigation of the response to C.  albicans challenge in a series of AcB/BcA recombinant congenic strains validated the  importance of C5 in determining the host response, although some strains with  discordant phenotypes were identified, suggestive of alternate mechanisms of genetic  control.</description><creator>Tuite, Ashleigh</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Biology, Genetics.</subject><title>Genetic analysis of differential susceptibility to infection with Candida albicans in mice</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/np1939649.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8623hz25j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kk91fm04w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Deeper understanding of the factors controlling stable isotopic  signatures of aquatic organisms of all trophic levels is required if we are to  properly use them in food web studies and as environmental indicators. The present  field study conducted in the Ste. Marguerite River system, Quebec, compared  periphyton signatures found in eight reaches (sections of a river/tributary) each  composed of a series of sites with different flow regimes. Similar to patterns found  in the laboratory, periphyton delta13C significantly decreased with increasing water  velocity. In addition, periphyton biomass positively affected periphyton delta13C.  Isotopic fractionation in favour of 12C by the periphyton communities likely leads  to build-up of the heavier isotope in the boundary layer of algae. This study allows  a better understanding of aquatic plant delta13C fluctuations. It also suggests how  much variability in aquatic consumer delta13 C can be explained by water velocity in  lotic systems.</description><creator>Trudeau, VÃ©ronique</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Food chains (Ecology) -- QuÃ©bec (Province) -- Sainte-Marguerite River</subject><subject>Aquatic organisms -- QuÃ©bec (Province) -- Sainte-Marguerite River</subject><title>Factors affecting stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures in food webs of the Ste.

The synthesis was also carried out by  conventional heating to assess the differences between the two procedures. The most  efficient synthesis was achieved by using microwave and by using PEG with molecular  weight 200 and MR 2% crosslinked containing 1.25 mmol Cl -/g. The structural  elucidation was carried out using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and  elemental analyses. Upon pyrolsis-GC/MS analysis of the PEGylated MR, the PEG showed  the tendency to undergo thermal degradation by the loss of a smaller PEG fragments.  This observed degradation of PEG was less prominent during microwave assisted  synthesis compared to conventional heating, in addition to faster reaction rates and  higher yields. As expected, the PEGylated MR showed improved swelling properties in  polar solvents. The chemical reactivity of the PEGylated Merrifield resin was  confirmed by the esterification with pyruvic acid and by the substitution of  hydroxyl group using thionyl chloride. In addition, the PEGylated MR was converted  into (1) polymer-supported acid/base or redox indicator by the attachment of a blue  organic dye - 2,6-dichloroindophenol (DCIP) through a nucleophilic substitution  reaction and (2) beta-cyclodextrin trap, a water insoluble inclusion-complex, by  immobilization of beta-cyclodextrin through cross-linking with 1,6-hexamethylene  diisocyanate reagent.</description><creator>Siu, Wing Kwan May, 1979-</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Gums and resins, Synthetic.</subject><subject>Microwave heating -- Industrial applications.</subject><subject>Polyethylene glycol -- Biotechnology.</subject><title>Applications and microwave assisted synthesis of poly(ethylene glycol) modified Merrifield resins</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dv13zt91w.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mp48sd28n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):35225</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
