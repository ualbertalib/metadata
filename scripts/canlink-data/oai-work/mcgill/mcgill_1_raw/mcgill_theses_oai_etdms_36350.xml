The basic goal of the tajdid was to recreate what he considered the ideal Sunni Islamic society. In order to achieve his objective he unfolded a plan of action which aimed at winning the support of the common people and the 'ulama'. For the people, he mounted a mass mobilization to boost religious learning, acquaint them with local beliefs adjudged as bad innovations, and exhort them about the impending End of Time. For the 'ulama', his plan was a reorientation of their attitudes toward moderation in theological and doctrinal matters, and accommodation of legal and religious views other than those of the Maliki School of Law. Further, he expected them to persuade the rulers of Gobir to change their un-Islamic ways and support the new movement. But when the 'ulama' chose not only to adopt a confrontational attitude but to prevail upon the rulers to take hostile measures against his followers, the Shehu took up arms against them and finally established a Caliphate.</description><creator>Tahir, Ahmad</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Usuman dan Fodio, 1754-1817 -- Political and social views.</subject><subject>Islam -- Fula Empire</subject><title>The social writings of Shaykh ʻUthmān b.

The Cree of Northern Quebec, who have a long history of independence and a strong central government, have ejected several psychologists from their lands. From the analysis of the psychological research conducted among the Cree it was concluded that ejections generally followed incidents of perceived disrespect for local authority systems. This analysis seemed to show that flexibility and a personal approach were considered by the Native subjects as important assets for a researcher. Other positive attributes included relevance of the research, Native origin of the researcher, and the use of information sessions after the research was concluded. Negative attributes included ethnocentrism of the researcher, the free expression of anger, demands for self-disclosure, question-asking, overpublication of results, over-identification with the host group, and ignorance of Cree history and culture. The situation for counsellors was found to have many similarities to the situation for researchers. To investigate the problem directly, a quasi-experiment was conducted with a group of James Bay Cree subjects, and their reaction to the research experience was polled after the experiment. It was found that the subjects often enjoyed the research. Personality tests were accepted in varying degrees, and certain Native values were affected in varying degrees. Subjects in a positive-feedback treatment group rated the experiment poorer in social responsibility and honesty than did subjects in a mixed positive-and-negative feedback group. The vast majority of subjects felt the study would have been better if it had been conducted by a Cree, and three subjects stated that the study should not have been conducted at all. From both the literature and the experimental study, the following sources of reactivity were recognized: inflexible protocol, ethnocentrism, expression of anger, requests for self-disclosure, excessive amounts of testing, question-asking, over-publishing of results, the use of deception, over-identification with the hosts, ignorance of Native history, differential treatment, and lack of redeeming social value. Aspects of psychological research considered positive by the Native subjects included: a personal approach, relevance, Native origin of the research, affiliation with a local person, advanced age of researcher, use of intrinsically valuable or at least entertaining instruments, ability of the researcher to read subtle messages, and use of information-sharing sessions. The key to conducting non-reactive research is to respect local authority. Respect can be shown by obtaining permission to enter the area, to access a subject pool, to conduct the research, and to publish the results. If permission is refused, that decision must be respected.</description><creator>Darou, Wes G.</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Psychology -- Research -- Effect of experimenters on</subject><subject>Indians of North America -- James Bay Region</subject><subject>Cree Indians</subject><subject>Interpersonal relations</subject><subject>Psychological research personnel</subject><title>Obstacles to effective experimentation : a study among the James Bay Cree</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7d278t708.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f1881m62b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3b591913n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:58:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The thesis is mainly concerned with the initial-value problem for barotropic Rossby waves linearized around a parabolic zonal flow, U (y) = U$ sb0$ + U$ sp prime$ y + U$ sp{ prime prime}$ y$ sp2$/2. It is shown that the non-dimensional equation for the perturbation depends on only one essential parameter, a = $-$2 ($ beta -$ U$ sp{ prime prime}$)/U$ sp{ prime prime}$. The associated Rayleigh-Kuo equation has a continuous spectrum of singulars modes for all values of "a" and an infinite number of discrete Rossby waves for a $&lt; -$.25. In Fourier space the problem has a Lagrangian formulation which permits a simple qualitative discussion concerning the nature of the interaction between the perturbation and the zonal flow. We have found new conservation laws that give insight into the dynamics of the jet. These results show a significant difference between the dynamics of easterlies and westerlies. Using results from the theory of Lie groups we have obtained a number of distinct separation of variables for a $ geq -$.25 in the long wave approximation. This allow the initial value problem to be completely solved and also provides a number of exact solutions which are localized in y. For certain values of "a" these have a simple analytical form that permits a comparison with previous results for a linear zonal wind. As in the uniform shear case we observe a temporary amplification for certain initial conditions, whose nature now depends on "a". We have shown that for an arbitrary initial condition of small amplitude (of order $ varepsilon$), the linearity hypothesis is invalidated when a $ ll$ 1 after a time of the order of $ varepsilon sp{-1}$ in a critical layer of width of order $ epsilon sp{1/2}$ centered at the jet extremum. We have also obtained the governing equations for the nonlinear evolution stage, which have a striking similarity with those for a forced Rossby wave on a linear wind profile.</description><creator>Brunet, Gilbert, 1958-</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</subject><title>Dynamique des ondes de Rossby dans un jet parabolique</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6d56zx24c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3b591913n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Meteorology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mc87pq99m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:58:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Geography is being more and more reduced to only one form of rationality, i.e. technical control. Such narrowness threatens all spiritual life and creativity. It calls on us to find new ways of thinking. Notwithstanding some refreshing break-throughs, especially its opening into literature, humanistic geography cannot be considered an adequate alternative to technical rationality. On the contrary, from a metaphysical perspective, humanism seems to be bordering on the very essence of technology. Its propositions partake of the system of metaphysical oppositions which determine the technological world. From a position which can be defined as a radicalization of phenomenology, and which aims at the removal of some major obstacles to geographical creativity, some of these oppositions are deconstructed. Probing the possibilities of bringing geography and literature closer together, the oppositions set up between geography and literature, the geographical and the literary use of language, metaphorical and literal language, geographical and literary criticism, are understood as prejudices which have contributed to the elimination of all non-technologically oriented endeavors.</description><creator>Lafaille, Richard</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Geography -- Study and teaching</subject><subject>Geography -- Philosophy</subject><title>La géographie et ses marges / par Richard Lafaille.</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bv73c114n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mc87pq99m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jm214p77k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:58:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence variation among 244 American shad (Alosa sapidissima) from 14 rivers spanning the (Florida-Quebec) range of the species revealed several unusual features of shad mtDNA polymorphism. Two types of heteroplasmy, one involving a length polymorphism and the other a restriction site are common in shad. The length polymorphism involves a novel tandem triplication of a 1.5-kb sequence in the D-loop region. Both forms of heteroplasmy stem from multiple mutational events. The mtDNA data indicate that shad populations are reproductively discrete, and suggest that differences in the reproductive traits of northern and southern shad populations have evolved since the Pleistocene. Low mtDNA sequence variation in shad may stem at least in part from Pleistocene population reductions. A fossil calibration supports an mtDNA divergence rate in shad at least one order of magnitude slower than the prevailing estimate for vertebrates.</description><creator>Bentzen, Paul</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Polymorphism (Zoology)</subject><subject>American shad -- Genetics.</subject><title>Mitochondrial DNA polymorphism in American shad (Alosa sapidissima) and its implications for population structure</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xd07gt33n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jm214p77k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5m60qs73x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:58:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A large sample (N = 206) of expert instructional designers was surveyed in order to determine how developmental testing is designed and conducted. The majority of respondents indicated that they did conduct formative testing of prototype instructional materials for purposes of revising them. Both one-to-one and small group testing were recommended with both the developer and the test subjects assuming active roles during the testing sessions. Both quantitative and qualitative (including attitudinal) data are gathered with an emphasis placed on the analysis of the posttest data. Based on a review of the literature and the results of the survey, an experiment was conducted in order to investigate the effects of different roles that the participants might play during testing sessions with different numbers of participants within sessions. Individuals assigned to small groups did not produce as many comments during instruction as the one-to-one procedure. A content analysis of the qualitative data revealed that test subjects generally comment by indicating comprehension/recall problems. As a source of feedback, the attitudinal survey provided a considerable amount of data especially with small groups which were reluctant to make critical comments during instruction.</description><creator>Burt, Charles Wesley</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Teaching -- Aids and devices -- Research</subject><subject>Test-taking skills -- Research</subject><title>Identification of critical variables in developmental testing and an experimental examination of the number and roles of participants in testing sessions</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9k41zf180.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5m60qs73x</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fb494913d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:58:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Rheological behavior and flow induced fiber orientation in simple flows of short glass fiber reinforced polypropylene melts were studied. Transient and steady state properties and in situ fiber orientation distribution were measured in simple shear flow, poiseuille flow, small amplitude oscillatory shear and uni-axial extensional flow. Strong correlation is found between the flow induced changes in fiber orientation distribution and measured bulk rheological properties. An extension of suspension theories for dilute systems is proposed, where multi-particle interactions are modeled as a randomizing process. The effect of non-Newtonian fluid properties is incorporated at the slow flow limit through its effect on the fiber orientation only. Model predictions for simple shear demonstrate the strong correlation between the changes in fiber orientation and bulk rheological properties.

Employing methods previously used to characterize 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D$ sb{ rm 3}$ (1,25(OH)$ sb{ rm 2}$D$ sb{ rm 3}$) receptors in established target tissues, classical receptors for this sterol were demonstrated in acinar cells of normal rat parotid gland. Submandibular gland, lacrimal gland and pancreatic acinar cells did not contain 1,25(OH)$ sb{ rm 2}$D$ sb{ rm 3}$ receptors. Vitamin D deprivation caused a decrease in the rate of production of pilocarpine-stimulated and auriculotemporal nerve-stimulated parotid saliva, which persisted when serum concentrations of calcium, parathyroid hormone and 1,25(OH)$ sb{ rm 2}$D$ sb{ rm 3}$ were maintained within normal limits, yet was reversed by treatment with vitamin D$ sb{ rm 3}$ (D$ sb{ rm 3}$). The concentration of calcium in pilocarpine-stimulated saliva did not correlate with decreased salivary flow, but appeared to vary with changes in the serum concentration of this ion. Amylase secretion and calcium release by exocytosis were normal in vitamin D-deprived rats. These findings suggested that fluid secretion but not protein secretion by parotid gland was vitamin D dependent, but that 1,25(OH)$ sb{ rm 2}$D$ sb{ rm 3}$ was not the active metabolite for this effect. Examination of the relative abilities of D$ sb{ rm 3}$, 25-hydroxyvitamin D$ sb{ rm 3}$ (25OHD$ sb{ rm 3}$), 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D$ sb3$ (24,25(OH)$ sb{ rm 2}$D$ sb{ rm 3}$) and 1,25(OH)$ sb{ rm 2}$D$ sb{ rm 3}$ to correct abnormal parotid function in vitamin D-deprived rats revealed that 24,25(OH)$ sb{ rm 2}$D$ sb{ rm 3}$ was the active metabolite, and essential for normal water and electrolyte secretion by parotid gland. Carbachol-stimulated potassium efflux from parotid glands from vitamin D-deprived rats was normal, suggesting that the site of action of 24,25(OH)$ sb{ rm 2}$D$ sb{ rm 3}$ was later in the sequence of fluid secretion.

Animated films produced in Canada can now be ranked with the works of other artists, including docudrama films. In this study, we show that, during their formative periods, Canadian authors of animated films shared a number of preoccupations with their fellow Quebec literary and pictorial artists, and cinematographers, the most important of which was a commitment to social protest. This study is a detailed analysis of some 250 short animated films produced at the National Film Board between 1950 and 1984. In their choice of themes, frequent didactic stance and experiments with image and sound, almost all animated film creators are seen to be engaged in questioning the status quo and/or calling for social and political change. Their films might be best characterized as exploratory, informative and persuasive. The analysis permits us to further classify the films as contributions made by Canadian men or women, English- or French-speaking animators, and foreign guests. In this study we have paid particular attention to the historical, esthetic and socio-cultural influences on the development of the contemporary animated film in Quebec during the different stages of its evolution.</description><creator>Carrière, Louise.</creator><date>1988</date><subject>National Film Board of Canada.</subject><subject>Animated films -- Canada</subject><title>Les films d'animation à l'O.N.F.

It is argued that the two conditions in question are in fact general conditions on argument structure rather than restrictions specific to the individual suffixes. The first, the Thematic Hierarchy Condition, which accounts for the unacceptability of unaccusative verbs and experiencer verbs with a Benefactive argument, follows from a universal tendency to have the highest thematic role as the external argument. The second, the Internal Argument Principle, which accounts for the unacceptability of the applicative and causative suffixes with verbs that take two obligatory internal arguments, follows from the fact that basic verbs across languages take no more than two internal arguments. It is argued that this second principle does not follow from Case Theory or Theta Theory. This thesis also demonstrates that the distinction between structural and inherent Case plays an important role in morphology. It accounts for certain differences between causatives and applicatives, including the unacceptability of causative verbs with an S$ sp prime$ complement and the order in which the applicative and causative suffixes appear.</description><creator>Machobane, ʾMalillo.</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Sotho language -- Study and teaching</subject><subject>Sotho language -- Verb -- Research</subject><subject>Sotho language -- Case -- Research</subject><subject>Sotho language -- Morphemics</subject><title>Some restrictions on the sesotho transitivizing morphemes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128nf43n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pz50gw87s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Linguistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2b88qc83b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:58:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The kinetics of spinodal decomposition has been studied by Monte Carlo renormalization group method. Using a standard block-spin transformation, we numerically renormalize the evolving configurations during the phase separation of a kinetic Ising model with spin-exchange dynamics. We find that in the scaling regime, the average domain size $R$($t$) grows in time as $R$ $ sim$ $t sp{n}$, with $n$ = 0.338 $ pm$ 0.008 consistent with the classical $n$ = 1/3 result of Lifshitz and Slyozov. A scaling form for the structure factor is obtained, which is invariant under the renormalization group transformation. The fluctuations around the average domain growth in Model A and Model B are studied using Monte Carlo simulation. The fluctuations, which are non-self-averaging, were found to have multiscaling properties and exhibit 1/$f$-like properties in the scaling regime. These properties point to the existence of analogies between dynamical and random systems, which need to be further explored.</description><creator>Roland, Christopher, 1961-</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Physics, Condensed Matter.</subject><title>Growth and scaling in first-order phase transitions</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5m60qs746.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2b88qc83b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4j03d041z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:58:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This qualitative naturalistic research study investigated peer interaction and its relationship to the learning of Logo geometry concepts within an elementary school computer lab classroom environment. The work of four focal children (10-11 years old) and their partners was analyzed. The study looked at (1) the kind of working relationships which existed between the partners, (2) the verbal strategies used by the partners during their mathematics disagreement, and (3) the ways in which the talk between the partners and the strategies they used both contributed to their learning, and reflected their learning, of the geometry concepts (with an emphasis upon the aspect of angular rotation). The findings revealed that all but one of the dyadic (and triadic) partnerships were collaborative and symmetrical: the children took turns giving information and explanation. At times the information was incorrect. The number of explanations given was very small. A range of peer teaching skills was in evidence. There was no correspondence found between the rate of use of higher level strategies (which included talk supported by reasons), and the child's general Logo achievement. However, the verbal strategies used during disagreements did reveal the children's modes of working and thinking. Seven of the ten children worked in an algorithmic way; the other three seemed to understand what they were doing when they worked with angular rotations. The study was able to report on aspects concerning the children's understanding of angular rotation in the early stages of Logo learning, as well as on the sociocognitive aspect concerning the effects that children working together can have upon their learning of Logo geometry concepts.</description><creator>Zack, Vicki</creator><date>1988</date><subject>LOGO (Computer program language) -- Study and teaching</subject><subject>Geometry -- Study and teaching</subject><title>Dyadic interaction in an elementary school computer lab classroom, and the learning of Logo geometry concepts</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/41687j14s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4j03d041z</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1c18dg36b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:58:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis focuses on three areas of investigation: construction and calibration of gypsum cylinders for the measurement of water flow; quantification of the relationship between flow and macrophyte structure; and the prediction of surficial sediment size structure in the littoral. Near-bottom water flow at 34 littoral sites was quantified using gypsum dissolution. Plant surface area within three weedbeds in Lake Memphremagog (Que. - Vt.) explained 67% of the variance in flow when the effect of water depth was removed. A model relating waterflow within beds to average wind energy and plant surface area was constructed. A multivariate model developed and tested in the littoral of Lake Memphremagog explained 67% of the variance in the proportion of sediment $&lt;$2 um in diameter (clay). The model included the physical variables of fetch, depth, and slope and biological measures of plant presence or absence and sediment organic matter. A second model required plant surface area and sediment organic matter to explain 83% of the variance in the proportion of clay at sites within weedbeds, near the depth of maximum plant biomass.</description><creator>Petticrew, Ellen Lesley</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Lake sediments -- Models.</subject><subject>Littoral drift -- Québec (Province) -- Mephremagog, Lake.</subject><subject>Lake plants -- Québec (Province) -- Mephremagog, Lake.</subject><title>Sedimentation patterns in nearshore zones of lakes supporting macrophytes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/44558d969.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1c18dg36b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:j96021345</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:58:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Human subjects were asked to "fixate" an earth-stationary target, in complete darkness, either during or after a brief passive head rotation. During head rotation saccadic eye movements synergistically improved compensatory slow-phase vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) stabilization. Visual-vestibular conflict that adaptively attenuated VOR gain caused the combined saccadic and slow-phase response to undercompensate for head rotation. Saccades volitionally generated after the cessation of head rotation (Vestibular Memory-Contingent Saccades, VMCS), successfully acquired the earth-fixed target, indicating that perceived vestibular information has access to the saccade generating mechanism. The above adaptive stimulus contracted the amplitude of VMCSs, suggesting a commensurate modification of the percept of self-movement relative to space. VMCSs displayed a "range effect", slightly biasing all results towards the mid-range amplitude. A schema is proposed implicating the posterior parietal cortex in the perception of vestibular input, the control of gaze and their adaptive modification.</description><creator>Bloomberg, Jacob</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><title>The role of vestibular perception in goal-directed oculomotor control /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pz50gw882.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j96021345</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physiology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xw42n8719</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:58:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The thesis indicates how central Canadian Methodists came to terms with Christian perfection in the years 1828-1884. It demonstrates that the concept was a matter of constant and considerable concern, and that the primary force in determining how it was attended to was the influence of John Wesley. The main elements of the concept are set out--an experience possible through momentary faith and resulting in cleansing from sin and the ability to love God with pure love. Influences upon Canadian Methodism are probed and, in particular, the thought of John Wesley on the subject is investigated. Lines of influence from Wesley to Canadian Methodism are traced. The thesis sketches the importance of the concept as seen in attempts to define it, to bring it to personal experience, to urge others to seek and find it.

ANF at 175 ng/kg/min, normal dogs increase sodium excretion ($ Delta$UNaV = 150 uEq/min) independent of changes in GFR and RPF. In contrast, when ANF was infused into chronic caval dogs (TIVC) or cirrhotic dogs (Cir) retaining sodium in the presence of ascites, they divided 50:50 into those who had a marked natriuretic response (responders, R) and those who had no natriuretic response (non-responders, NR). Of 46 TIVC dogs, 22 R had UnaV of 185 + 35 uEq/min and 24 NR had $ Delta$UNaV = 2 + 1 uEq/min. In 19 Cir dogs, 9 R had $ Delta$UNaV = 60 + 10 uEq/min and 10 NR had $ Delta$UNaV = 1.3 +.6 uEq/min. R and NR could not be differentiated in terms of atrial content of ANF, plasma iANF, ANF T1/2, plasma levels of renin and aldosterone, systemic hemodynamics, plasma volume, or papillary plasma flow. All dogs generated plasma and urinary cGMP equally. Renal denervation or vasodilitation did not increase sodium excretion in response to ANF in RN. When NR dogs returned to sodium balance in the presence of ascites, the natriuretic response was restored ($ Delta$UNaV = 90-340 uEq/min) and was not different from R dogs in this phase. Cir dogs studied sequentially in the pre-ascitic phase responded normally to ANF infusion when they were in sodium balance but split 50:50 into R and NR at week 4 during a period of sodium retention, plasma volume expansion, elevated plasma iANF and normal renin and aldosterone. We conclude that the blunting of UNaV in response to ANF is a characteristic of the sodium-retaining kidney, is reversible when sodium balance is restored and occurs at a tubular level, most likely in the medulla.</description><creator>Maher, Elizabeth Anne</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><title>Atrial natriuretic factor in two canine models of ascites : cardiac release and heterogeneity of renal natriuretic response</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7m01bm355.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5999n403w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physiology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5x21tg09w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:58:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Acute heat exposure is more lethal to spontaneously hypertensive mice (SHM) than to normal mice. By genetic breeding experiments, we have demonstrated that the gene responsible for thermosensitivity, defined as the rate of body temperature increase, segregates with an increment of blood pressure in the F2 generation, supporting the possibility that thermosensitivity is part of a locus involved in hypertension. This locus is responsible for 25% of the difference in blood pressure between normal mice and SHM. Although severe, acute heat exposure is more detrimental in hypertension, brief episodes of chronic, mild heat stress are beneficial in that they normalize basal blood pressure in SHM. After 35 days of chronic heat treatment, the blood pressure of hypertensive mice is indistinguishable from that of the normotensives. The molecular response to heat which is characterized by the induction of heat stress genes, is abnormal in hypertension. Accumulation of heat stress proteins (HSP70) and of their mRNA following heat exposure is greater in tissues from hypertensive animals. These higher levels of hsp70 mRNA are observed not only after whole body heat exposure but also after in vitro heat stress of isolated organs and cells, and are due to an increased transcriptional rate of hsp70 gene. Our results indicate that increased heat sensitivity is associated with high blood pressure. When heat sensitivity is modified by chronic heat exposure, which could lead to the development of thermotolerance, there is a decrease in blood pressure. Abnormalities in the heat shock response in hypertensive animals may be responsible for their increased heat sensitivity as a part of the expression of the environmental modulation of hypertension.</description><creator>Malo, Danielle</creator><date>1989</date><subject>Biology, Genetics.</subject><title>Biological effects and genetic analysis of thermosensitivity in hypertension</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jq085k87b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5x21tg09w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gm80hw022</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:58:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The present industrial practice of ac to dc rectification uses diode or thyristor bridges which are harmonic polluters and poor power factor sources. The research of this thesis is directed towards exploiting fast, gate-turn-off semiconductor switching devices and PWM techniques in order to develop a new generation of rectifiers with nearly sinusoidal current waveforms operating at unity or even leading power factor. The scope of the investigation is restricted to the Boost rectifier (as opposed to Buck) which has bilateral power transfer capability through bidirectional current flow in the dc link. The stand-alone, Boost Type PWM Voltage Regulated Rectifier was originally conceived as being Direct Current Controlled. The work of the thesis advances the control methodology by replacing the inner hysteresis current feedback loop by Indirect Current Control, which uses the standard sinusoidal PWM technique. In the process, the cost of two expensive high quality current transducers is avoided. Furthermore, Sinusoidal PWM has more predictable characteristics harmonics for filter design on harmonic elimination purposes. The thesis addresses the problem of upscaling the voltage and current ratings of the rectifiers. Many semiconductor switching devices have inherent difficulties in voltage and current sharing when connected in series and/or in parallel. These difficulties are avoided by connecting rectifier modules in series and/or in parallel. Different topologies for both series and parallel connections have been analyzed mathematically. Digital simulations and experiments have confirmed the analyses. The research was carried out by building 2 kW size laboratory models which were subjected to demanding experimental tests. Experimentally justified mathematical models have been developed and have successfully been used in predicting stability boundaries and in the dynamic compensation of feedback control.</description><creator>Dixon, Juan W.
