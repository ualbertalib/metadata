Patients with both adrenal cortical hyperfunction and hypofunction were investigated in the untreated disease state, after hormonal therapy and also in two cases after surgical treatment. Normal subjects were studied for purposes of comparison. The qualitative and quantitative differences in the patterns were thus evaluated under various physiological conditions.</description><creator>Sybulski, Stella.</creator><contributor>Venning, E.

The problem is particularly acute where exports consist of relatively few primary commodities. The past few years have given a striking demonstration of the catastrophic consequences of the dependence by any country on the production and export of a few major commodities, particularly in periods of war or preparation for war. Indonesia, for example, is dependent upon two major exports, tin and rubber, for approximately two-thirds of its foreign exchange earnings.</description><creator>Subroto.</creator><contributor>Kemp, M.

The two mechanisms are found to be about equally important. In the case of positron decay interference between the two modes greatly reduces the transition probability. An earlier calculation, that of Feinberg , using first order perturbation theory with a static interaction between the beta particle and the atomic electron, led to the result that the collision effect is negligible compared to the shaking effect at or near threshold, in disagreement with the result of this thesis.

As an art form humour has been less analysed than its counterpart, tragedy, and until recently little attention had even been paid to the nature of the laughter which accompanies humour.

Except that members of the Slate and Greenstone divisions are scattered throughout the group, the rock divisions apparently are superposed in the above order. The porphyry is believed to be the intrusive equivalent of the rhyolite. The Greenstone division comprises greenstone, spilite, and minor ironformation. The subgreywacke-graptolitic shale-greenstone association indicates deposition in a eugeosyncline in an epineritic environment. The regional metamorphism is low grade (greenschist facies).</description><creator>Skinner, Ralph.</creator><contributor>Clark, T.

On the shell-side however, two major problems must be overcome before these values can be determined. First, the flow pattern around the baffles and through the tube-bundle is difficult to determine accurately and leakage paths through the baffle clearance-holes and around the tube-bundle periphery make it difficult even to determine the mass-flow through the active portion of the exchanger.</description><creator>Shaw, Gerald.

To begin with, the job shop cannot plan accurately the future operations on the basis of a sales department. The sales forecast may be of some value in establishing the budget but its true usefulness ends there. The operations of the job shop are governed by the number of work orders received. In most cases these orders are received following the aggressive selling efforts of the sales department.</description><creator>Seguin, Maurice. J.</creator><contributor>White, J.

With this simple experiment Ludwig proved that the secretion is a process sui generis and not a simple filtration of plasma water and solutes through the glandular cells. However, most of the early workers on salivary secretion confined their studies chiefly to the investigation of the organic matter (protein and mucin) in saliva, and there was considerable debate as to the mode of elaboration of this organic material (Heidenhain, 1868, 1878; Langley &amp; Fletcher, 1890; Henri &amp; Malloizel, 1902; Carlson, Greef and Becht, 1907-8; Babkin, 1913).</description><creator>Seeman, Philip.</creator><contributor>Burgen, A.

At low concentrations, equivalent amounts of each alkali were sorbed (approximately 1.5 milliequivalents alkali per gram lignin). At higher concentrations different amounts were sorbed. The integral heats of sorption showed the same general trends. The results indicated that the process is chemisorption on acidic hydrogen groups in the lignin. The mechanism of the sorption process is discussed.</description><creator>Screaton, Ross. M.</creator><contributor>Mason, S.

Since the latter reaction may involve the formation of N-halogen compounds as intermediates, it seemed desirable to prepare several of the unknown N-halogen derivatives or the cyclic imides.</description><creator>Scott, Robert.

Dale (1914}, with the help of his colleague Ewins, identified it in some samples of ergot and studied its pharmacology extensively. In his classical report, he described its evanescent action and suggested that it is hydrolysed rapidly in the body. He also described that it has two kinds of actions: (1) muscarinic and (2) nicotinic. The muscarinic action, a depressor effect on the effector cell, is exerted at the postganglionic endings of the parasympathetic; and its nicotinic action, which consists of an initial stimulation followed by an inhibition is exerted on the ganglionic cells of both the divisions of the autonomic nervous system.</description><creator>Sastry, Podila-Brahmayya.</creator><contributor>MacIntosh, F.
