The elucidation of the chemical structure of cholesterol was mainly due to the researches of Windaus and his associates, aided by the work of Wieland on the bile acids, and the studies of Suida and Mauthner on the derivatives of cholesterol. In 1919 Windaus arrived at a tentative formula which was changed, as a result of further work by Rosenheim, King, Dane, Diels and Gadke, and the final formulation as we know it today was decided upon in 1932.</description><creator>Zaharia, William.</creator><contributor>Heard, R.D.H.

Just what factors may produce this loss is not known with any certainty. The older person may be a poorer learner because he forms new associations less rapidly, or because he retains them less well.

This was soon afterwards confirmed by Abderhalden, Fromme and Hirsch (1). With the development of modern techniques for the separation of amino acids in the past decade, it has become apparent that GABA is widely distributed in animal and plant tissues as well as in micro-organisms (36).</description><creator>Van Gelder, Nico.

High frequency stimulation through the same electrodes produced a pattern or behavioural arousal or fear in some animals. Low frequency stimulation of medial and lateral thalamic nuclei which did not produce inhibition, had no effect on the learning or retention of an avoidance response. Evidence is presented to show that the inhibition caused by low frequency stimulation acts on both sensory and motor mechanisms.</description><creator>Vanderwolf, Cornelius.

Many factors have been implicated, one being that volume plays a role in the regulation of sodium in the body. It has been suggested that there may be receptors somewhere in the body, which are sensitive to changes in the volume of fluid or in the concentration of electrolytes. It has not been clearly established yet whether they are sensitive to blood volume, plasma colloid osmotic pressure, interstitial fluid volume, or some other factor. The importance of the adrenal cortex in influencing sodium metabolism is well established.</description><creator>Uete, Tetsuo.</creator><contributor>Venning, E.

More specifically an attempt has been made to elucidate the role of dietary tryptophan in the operation of these two pathways. Previous investigators have implied that thiamine is involved in the kynurenine-forming pathway. Both nutritional studies and experiments in vitro were carried out to determine just where thiamine (or thiamine pyrophosphate, its coenzyme form) exerts its action.</description><creator>Townsend, Edith.

The reasons for this can be grouped under two general headings; firstly, the poorer working conditions which prevail and secondly, the effect which a low ambient temperature has on the strength of freshly poured concrete. The lower standard of working conditions in winter are due mainly to snow, the fewer hours of daylight available and the heavy clothing worn and personal discomfort experienced by the workers. These factors result in added cost due to snow removal, artificial lighting and a decrease in output of the labour force.</description><creator>Thompson, Richard. D.</creator><contributor>Wilson, V.

Her problems of central banking are part of the general problem as to whether central banking institutions are necessary in underdeveloped countries, or not. No matter what importance a central bank has for an underdeveloped country, it is now a fact that every country regards it as an indispensable part of the institutional framework of her economy. In fact the central banks of today have become a symbol of independence in the regulation of monetary affairs of a country.</description><creator>Thanos, Costas.

In many cases, such as the passage of gases in the lungs, it is probably a physical process, but one can visualize the existence of special transfer processes in certain tissues. The transfer of material through the wall of the small intestine, or the reabsorption of material in the renal tubules, could conceivably be due to the existence of a special process. Van Slyke and Meyer (1), in 1912, were the first to suggest that such a process exists in all tissues.</description><creator>Tenenhouse, Alan.</creator><contributor>Quastel, J.

Considering a two person zero sum game, the equivalence of the theorem to the existence of “good” strategies in any finite game is shown, and implications to certain types of games discussed. Although there are several independent proofs of the theorem, most fall into two broad categories--the one using the theory of convex sets, the other the fixed point property of certain transformations. We examine in detail one proof of each type, and extend the theorem to the case of one player having a countable number of choices at each play of the game.</description><creator>Teitlebaum, Albert.
