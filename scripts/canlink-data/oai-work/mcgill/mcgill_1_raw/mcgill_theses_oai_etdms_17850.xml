These facts imply that ore metals travel in some way from a source to the places where they are found. Various theories have been put forward which purport to explain how this may happen. Because metals and their common silicates and sulphides are, with a few exceptions, volatile only at temperatures considerably above the temperatures at which epithermal deposits are thought to form, most theories postulate the presence of water to act as a moving flux in which the ore constituents are carried along.</description><creator>Relly, Bruce.

Most of the field work has been restricted to the vicinity of Quebec City, where the occurrence is not representative of the whole. The present investigation evaluates existing ideas on the origin of the conglomerate on the basis of field evidence collected mainly near Grosses Roches and also at Trois Pistoles. A new approach, the gravitational gliding hypothesis, is proposed. It is postulated that the limestone conglomerate formed as a beach talus below Lower Cambrian to Lower Ordovician limestone cliffs.</description><creator>Rejhon, George.</creator><contributor>Stearn, C.

Particularly, two disabilities (Phelan-McDermid syndrome and attentionhyperactivity disorder) with significantly different functional implications were examined.Siblings completed measures on behavioural and emotional functioning, self-concept,and sibling relationship quality. For both disability groups, no positive or negative effectson sibling weIl-being were found when compared to siblings oftypicaIly developingchildren. Sibling relationship quality was different for aIl three groups of siblings. Whenthere was disability in the home, siblings reported less intimacy in their relationships.Siblings of children with Phelan-McDerrnid syndrome reported more mutual admiration,more power and less conflict in their relationships than siblings oftypically developingchildren. They also reported more warmth in their relationship than siblings of childrenwith attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

In other words ecological research sets out to define the relations between animais and their environments. Besides endeavouring to describe and understand the natural habitats and environments of animals and plants, ecological investigations are also concerned with theoretical questions such as to what extent and therefore why an animal can exist under one set of environmental conditions and not under another. Unfortunately very little is known of this aspect. Most of the past studies on animal ecology have been chiefly concerned with the relation of organisms to each other than to their relations to the physical and chemical environment.

It has been shown that the lecithin of these mitochondria is susceptible to the hydrolytic action of the thermostable phospholipase A of heated snake venoms and that lysolecithin is produced.

L. Hollingworth wrote that, "among the numerous familiar fears of mankind none is more common than 'stage fright' (22, p. 173). Yet, despite its ubiquitous nature, the phenomenon is only poorly understood. The broad aim of the present study is to extend this understanding in the conviction that "stage fright" is of interest in its own right and that the concept is of theoretical value for psychology, particularly that aspect of social psychology concerned with group phenomena.</description><creator>Paivio, Allan U.</creator><contributor>Lambert, W.

The principal factors affecting the tests are pointed out, and suggestions are made to guide further studies of the subject.</description><creator>Padopulos, Diogenes.</creator><contributor>Coates, D.F.

Brown-back and the fifth angle showed a general increase northward in frequency within the confines of the Peninsula compared with contiguous regions.

In particular, the stress response of rock masses merits doser attention. Most large engineering projects utilize rock materials either directly, as part of the structure, or indirectly, as the foundation upon which the structure will rest. In tunneling and in mining, excavations are completely surrounded by rock and usually induce in it the extreme stress response of ultimate failure. [...]</description><creator>Ortlepp, W.
