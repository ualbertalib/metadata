To build these  devices, a process of fabrication was developed including the construction of an  electro-optic poling station for ferroelectric domain inversion of LiTaO3. This  fabrication process was used to construct electro-optic prism beam scanners, which  were designed and simulated to provide voltage controlled deflection of a collimated  laser beam at 1310nm. Two electro-optic scanners were tested yielding linear  deflection up to 1.064° and 0.986° at 1500V; agreeing well with  simulation. Both scanners were found to have insertion losses of 1.7 dB and 2.3 dB  in the off and on states respectively, and crosstalk of -25 dB. Degradation of  performance was measured as a function of polarization extinction ratio,  polarization misalignment, and applied voltage. Both devices are found to exhibit  performance well suited for the construction of 1 x 2 fiber optic  switches.</description><creator>Tremblay, Eric J.</creator><contributor>Plant, David V.

The stress on lowering the voltage supply, the power consumption, the  cost and increasing level of integration are the driving forces behind today's RF  microelectronics research. The goal of this thesis is to show the possibility of standard  CMOS technology replacing the traditional technologies in RFIC applications,  specifically in the design and implementation of frequency synthesizers for 5GHz  WLAN applications. The frequency synthesizer is a key building block of WLAN  transceivers. To generate multiple frequencies with the resolution required by 5GHz  WLAN standards, a fractional-N frequency synthesizer architecture was successfully  implemented in 1.8V 0.18mum CMOS technology. To be able to cover the lower and upper  5GHz bands of both HiperLan and 802.11a standards, a wide tuning range quadrature  voltage controlled oscillator (VCO), providing a 4-phase output and operating from  5GHz to 6GHz, was used in the phase lock loop (PLL) design. The 5GHz WLAN standards  are targeted since they are the most promising, they have few interferers and large  data throughputs. This thesis presents one of the few frequency synthesizers  having a large bandwidth of operation and a small resolution reported to-date for  this type of application. Also, the digital components used in this frequency  synthesizer, namely the fractional-N divider and prescaler have the lowest power  consumption reported to-date.</description><creator>Marsolais, Alexandre</creator><contributor>El-Gamal, Mourad (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Design and implementation of a 1.8 volt wide band CMOS fractional-N frequency synthesizer for the complete 5 to 6 Giga-Hertz band</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128nf34p.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1g05fc19x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1c18dg30p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis develops the concept of qualitative model-based  fault diagnosis technique and applies it to extrusion blow molding. The extrusion  blow molding process is reviewed along with theories of qualitative reasoning, from  which process-based qualitative models are developed.

CMOS radio frequency  class-E power amplifiers (PA) for GMSK/GFSK modulations have been designed and  fabricated using 0.25/0.35mum technologies. The operating frequencies are centered  at 1.2GHz and 2.65GHz with 24--26dBm output power. In order to reduce the driving  requirement, mode locking techniques are employed for both designs. High efficiency  broadband off-chip hybrid ring baluns are used at both input and output for  converting signals from single-ended to differential and vice versa. Regular bonding  wires are used as inductors for the 1.2GHz PA, and on-chip bondwires are used for  the 2.65GHz PA. With a 1.3V supply, the measured power added efficiency (PAE) of the  1.2GHz PA, after taking into account the losses in the baluns, is 62%. The PAE for  the 2.65GHz PA is 38% when operated from a 1.7V power supply. Furthermore, a  transmitter stage for 5.5GHz frequency application has been designed and simulated  using a 0.18mum CMOS technology. The design and layout is completed, with a  simulation frequency of 5.9GHz and an output signal of 7dBm.</description><creator>Hung, Tang Tat, 1976-</creator><contributor>El-Gamal, Mourad N.

The clock domains are equipped with synchronizers for  adaptation to an asynchronous communication channel. We propose two synchronization  schemes: one for interfacing a fixed-frequency clock domain to a pausible clock  domain and one for interfacing two independent fixed-frequency clock domains. In the  first scheme, the sender uses a fixed-frequency clock and the receiver uses a  pausible clock. In the second scheme, both the sender and the receiver use  fixed-frequency clocks, but their frequencies are uncorrelated.  Metastability-related failures are reduced by converting failures in the data path  into failures in the control path, where they can be more easily accommodated.  Throughputs are improved by using the asP* handshaking protocol. We demonstrate  applicability of the proposed schemes on two case studies: a parity detector circuit  for memory operation, and a cross-bar switch. Hspice simulations using 0.18  technology demonstrates proper operation of all proposed designs.</description><creator>Huang, Shaomei, 1974-</creator><contributor>Negulescu, Radu (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>High performance interfacing for mixed-timing circuits</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sb3978899.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jm214p69w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qn59q4563</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The main objective of this thesis was to explore, characterize  and evaluate different CeO2-based electrolyte materials that could be employed to  replace the existing yttria-stabilized zirconia oxide used as the electrolyte  component of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). The  electrolyte materials were synthesized using a radio frequency inductively coupled  plasma reactor. CeO2-based fine powders doped with different compositions of Gd, Sm  or Y were synthesized from nitrate salts dissolved in water. The powders were  analyzed using X-ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma (ICP), SEM and EDS  (energy dispersive spectroscopy). It was demonstrated that the concentrations of Ce  and dopants fed in the solutions were retained in the synthesized powders. The  products were all crystalline and had multimodal size distributions. The effect of  plasma synthesis parameters, i.e. plasma power, reactor pressure, and plasma flow  rate on particle size distribution was studied. This analysis provides fundamental  understanding of the mechanism of particle formation and collection in thermal  plasma environments.</description><creator>Castillo Martinez, Ian Altri</creator><contributor>Munz, Richard J.

Using a novel algorithm which analyses all spectra simultaneously, it has been found that the majority of available peptides are not fragmented with the current switching scheme. Unfortunately, it is not practical to experiment with the mass spectrometer to determine optimal switching parameters. In this study, simulation coupled with intensity surface analysis was used as a method of evaluating mass spectrometer performance. Algorithms that mimic the mass spectrometer were created in order to simulate its response to various data sets. The simulations resulted in operating curves displaying the trade-off between quality and quantity of fragment spectra. The optimal operating curve demonstrated that the current switching scheme is sub-optimal, and that new switching parameters with fewer duty cycles and fewer repetitions should be selected.</description><creator>Brian, Carrillo</creator><contributor>Kearney, Robert E.

The  type of messages teachers are sending to children when they are in the classroom in  relation to the concepts of masculinity and feminity are discussed. The analysis is  rooted in qualitative research methodology and the gender category. Gender is seen  as a social phenomenon. The paper deals with the work that has been done in gender and  schools, especially related to the role teachers have when dealing with gender in  the classroom. It discusses how a different method of education, in this case the  Montessori method, differs from the traditional system of education when dealing  with gender issues. The way teachers deal with gender issues at school is deeply  connected to the viewpoint of gender they have. The narratives of the teachers help  us understand this relation. It is hoped that by examining their own practice toward  gender issues teachers will take a first step towards a non-sexist education. It is  true that the Montessori system breaks from many of the conventional gender-biased  practices of traditional schools; even so, a total change cannot be seen until our  own perspectives on gender evolve.</description><creator>Moreno Méndez, Ana Rosa</creator><contributor>Mitchell, Claudia (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Gender identity in education -- Mexico.</subject><subject>Montessori method of education -- Mexico.</subject><title>Teacher-student interaction in a Mexican Montessori school : exploring the construction of gender identity in young children</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x920fx44n.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/02870w48g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zs25x9238</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis examines the testimonies of victims related to the  use of torture during the Pinochet dictatorship. It contends that the existence of a  broad testimonial archive on torture, significantly produced by the victims  themselves, points to a collective 'speech' by which victims have attempted to  splinter the silence of the dictatorial state and, in the aftermath of the  repression, to contest the 'official history' of the transitional state. The  testimonies of torture victims, it will be argued, signify a specific mode of  action, a 'doing' of memory, whereby the experience of torture is re-membered in an  effort to bring accountability for the crimes committed and this, from the first  days of the dictatorship up to today. This speech of victims moreover is seen to  constitute the unifying link between the testimonies of torture victims that have  emerged during the dictatorship itself and those that continue to emerge  today.</description><creator>Olavarría, María José</creator><contributor>Corin, Ellen (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Chile -- Politics and government -- 1973-</subject><subject>Torture victims -- Chile.</subject><subject>Truth commissions -- Chile.</subject><subject>Victims of state-sponsored terrorism -- Chile.</subject><title>Fractured past : torture, memory and reconciliation in Chile</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fx719n01x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zs25x9238</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anthropology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sn009z41p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of the current investigation was to examine the  effects of implementing a pictographic schedule within a currently structured  swimming class consisting of individuals diagnosed with autism. Three boys (11 to 17  years) enrolled at a school for children with developmental disabilities served as  participants. A time-series design was used to assess the effects of the  pictographic activity schedules on the variables of time on-task, time off-task, and  inappropriate response time in the activity setting, while rates of inappropriate  behaviour were examined within the associated changeroom setting prior to and  following the activity setting. The results indicated that activity schedules, when  implemented in a physical activity setting, increase time on-task and decrease  inappropriate response time in children with autism. In addition, when compared to  periods of no schedule-use, activity schedules assisted in the reduction of rates of  inappropriate behaviour within settings prior to and following activity sessions.  Findings for the variable of time off-task yielded inconclusive results. The  implications of these findings show the importance of visual activity schedules  within all domains of education, including those involving physical  activity.</description><creator>Pushkarenko, Kyle</creator><contributor>Reid, Greg (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Swimming for people with disabilities</subject><subject>Autistic children</subject><title>Enhancing the structure of a swimming program for three boys with autism thorugh the use of activity schedules</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vh53ww40n.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sn009z41p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:th83m0006</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is concerned with the "Americanity" of  Quebec literature and the existence of a cultural formation specific to the New  World, based on a context of renewal, distancing and rupture with respect to  European influence.

Using three novels that tell the story of a  mother who is also a writer, Margaret Laurence's The Diviners, Audrey Thomas'  Intertidal Life and Carol Shields' Unless, I will outline the manner in which the  roles of mother and writer are negotiated by the authors and their central  characters. Further, I will investigate how creating a narrative about a female  artist who is also a mother challenges and changes the structure and content of the  standard female kunstlerroman. Finally, this thesis will attempt to determine how or  if such challenges and changes improve the portrait-of-the-female-artist  novel.</description><creator>Langston, Jessica</creator><contributor>Cooke, Nathalie (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2004</date><subject>Canadian literature -- 20th century -- History and criticism</subject><subject>Mothers in literature</subject><subject>Women authors in literature</subject><title>Writing herself in : mother fiction and the female Künstlerroman</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/br86b409j.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bc141</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9019s308f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The imbroglio of Jerusalem is arguably at the center of the  Arab-Israeli conflict and presents an impasse to establishing peace. Its capacity to  evoke powerful emotions is the key to understanding the connection between politics  and sacred.1 The intent of this work is to closely examine the connection between  politics and holy space by analyzing how Hamas' use of Jerusalem's sanctity and  space for its symbolic value during the first Intifaḍa (1987--1993)  contributed to simultaneously fueling the Intifaḍa and creating the  potential to thwart peace in a number of ways: by portraying the Palestinian-Israeli  conflict as a continuation of the conflict between the Muslim and Jewish communities  in seventh century Arabia; justifying the Muslim Palestinian claim that Israel is an  illegitimate entity on Islamic land; rejecting any form of negotiation or peace  process as un-Islamic; mobilizing the masses; justifying armed struggle for  Jerusalem in the form of jihad; gaining political influence; and presenting an  alternative to the national-secular agenda of the Palestine Liberation Organization  (PLO). 1Roger Friedland and Richard D.

In 2002, less than 25% of  Canadians were members of a traditional faith community or regularly participated in  formal or informal organized religious practices. Nonetheless, Reginald Bibby has  claimed Christianity is making a comeback in Canada. He has argued that the  continued reliance on religious rites of passage by nominal and non-affiliates  represents the continued influence of traditional Christian religion on the lives of  Canadians, and the return to traditional religious communities for rites of passage  represents opportunities for those faith communities to bring the lost sheep back to  the fold. This thesis tests Bibby's claim through an examination of the social  authority of traditional organized religion over contemporary death rituals  practiced in Canada. Although Bibby may be encouraged by the continued presence of  traditional Christian religious leadership in many contemporary death rituals, the  inclusion of religion is often a precarious one that is more often the result of a  situational religious response to fulfill a cultural expectation than the desire to  perform a sacred ritual that reinforces one's relationship with a traditional faith  community or the transcendent being it worships.</description><creator>Lamoureux Scholes, Laurie</creator><contributor>Young, Katherine (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Religion, General.</subject><subject>Canadian Studies.</subject><title>The social authority of Religion in Canada : a study of contemporary death rituals</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vx021f86f.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5m60qs63p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Religious Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qv33rx26p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis compares the concepts presented in the Seventeenth  Discussion of al-Ghazali's Tahafut al-Falasifa with concepts currently being  discussed in the field of quantum physics. Written as an attack on the neo-Platonic  and Aristotelian thinking which challenged the orthodox theology of Medieval Islam,  Tahafut al-Falasifa (Incoherence of the Philosophers) questions the understanding of  physical reality forwarded by the philosophers of al-Ghazali's times. The  Seventeenth Discussion ('On causality and miracles') in particular, with its aim of  proving the possibility of miracles, questions the acceptance of notions such as  necessary causality and the validity of scientific observation in the natural  world. Although several scholars have examined al-Ghazali's argument in  the Seventeenth Discussion in terms of causality, observation and the nature of  human conceptions of physical reality, and many others have noted the implicit  potential connections between quantum theory and concepts of religiosity, only one,  Karen Harding, has attempted a synthesis of the ideas put forth within these two  seemingly diverse subjects. This thesis, then, carries forward from the ideas of  Harding and attempts an original comparative analysis of the two.

We first show that both Rousseau and Roy link their ultimate  autobiographical desire to the imminence of their own death. We then show that their  autobiographical activity is not only motivated by death, but, moreover, that it  allows them in a certain sense to live it already, since what this activity allows  them to do is, for them, similar to what they long to do in the afterlife. We  suggest, finally, that this activity, which allows them to bequeath an ideal picture  of themselves that will survive them, gives them a hold on their  immortality.</description><creator>Desruisseaux-Talbot, Amélie</creator><contributor>Ricard, Francois (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Everett, Jane (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Roy, Gabrielle, 1909-1983 -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><subject>Autobiography</subject><subject>Rousseau, Jean-Jacques, 1712-1778 -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><title>Le dernier souffle autobiographique : J.-J.

How so? With what  limits? With what results? I depart from previous explorations of these questions by  rejecting their definition of tragedy as a work faithful to the dramatic conventions  described in Aristotle's Poetics. I build instead on Aristotle's essential  definition of tragedy as a work that inspires fear and pity in an audience. Using a  narrative-critical approach, which allows a focus on the effects generated by Mark's  plot and characters, I conclude that Mark, while more tragic than Matthew, is not  clearly tragic or comic: the gospel maintains a careful balance of tragic and comic  possibilities, challenging the reader to appropriate the story in her own world and  tip the scales towards the comic. The effect of the text, however, is dependent on  audience; Matthew's rewriting of and Papias' comments on Mark demonstrate that  contemporary readers probably did not perceive Mark as tragic.</description><creator>Berube, Amelinda</creator><contributor>Henderson, Ian H.

Biomedical discourse hegemony in the production of a discourse on women's body has  been sometimes reinforced and sometimes questioned by feminist movements. The  interviews reveal that despite the impact of feminist discourses, women's experience  seems deeply influenced by biomedical and hygienist discourses and by negative  stereotypes commonly found in society at large.

The thesis examines  articulations of power in relations between State and Aboriginal communities,  demonstrating the importance of such a medium for the conceptualization of  Aboriginal Nation and construction of identity in the contemporary context. The  Eastern Door is an important vehicle for communicating Mohawk identity and  nationhood, a role it consciously plays, as part of its commitment to political  autonomy. Its commitment is shown by its discursive explorations: of avenues, themes  chosen, concerns expressed and language used. An element of this commitment is an  emphasis on collective and individual behaviour, and on "being" as an  expression of Mohawk identity, both of which provide powerful bases of action for  the community and in relations with the State. If this thesis underlines that State  interest and power are an influence on these processes, it also demonstrates that  the Mohawk engagement with cultural politics is influential itself, allowing the  Mohawks to develop political strategies vis-a-vis the State, and even to impose  political agendas that have to be engaged with by the government.</description><creator>Smith, Mary, 1977-</creator><contributor>Lambert, Carmen (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Indians of North America -- Québec (Province) -- Kahnawake Indian Reserve -- Periodicals</subject><subject>Mohawk Indians -- Periodicals.</subject><subject>Mohawk Indians -- Ethnic identity.</subject><subject>Kahnawake Indian Reserve (Québec)</subject><subject>Kahnawake Indian Band (Québec)</subject><title>Representation and power : "The eastern door"</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mw22v6038.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2j62s5419</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anthropology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x633f179p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Soccer experts (N = 18), novices (N = 16), and children who are  physically awkward (N = 18), were studied for differences in self-regulatory  forethought and self-reflection processes during a soccer kicking task.

Participants included 10 children with DCD and  10 without. A sport specific problem-solving task (shooting at a hockey net) and an  educational problem-solving task (peg solitaire) were compared. Zimmerman's (2000)  social cognitive model of self-regulation was used; it has three phases (a)  forethought, (b) performance or volitional control, and (c) self-reflection.  Participants were taught to think aloud during both tasks to access cognitive  processes (Ericsson &amp; Simon, 1984/1993). Codes were developed under five major  categories, (a) goals, (b) knowledge, (c) emotion, (d) monitoring, and (e)  evaluation. Verbalizations were transcribed and coded using the NUD*IST Vivo  software. Results indicated that children with DCD have decreased knowledge in the  motor domain, may have general difficulties with planning and set less challenging  goals. The findings also support previous research regarding their negative emotions  attached to motor tasks.</description><creator>Lloyd, Meghann</creator><contributor>Reid, Greg (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Psychomotor disorders</subject><subject>Movement disorders</subject><subject>Problem solving in children</subject><title>Self-regulation of sport specific and educational problem-solving tasks by children with and without developmental coordination disorder</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j6731458h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6t053g67b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3b5919092</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis argues that the stakeholder paradox (Goodpaster,  1991) has hindered the achievement of meaningful consultation processes because it  perpetuates a management-centered discourse of stakeholder engagement aimed at  producing stakeholder consent and legitimating organizational action. In order to  advance beyond the use of stakeholder consultation as a sophisticated public  relations tool, and instrument of organizational power and persuasion, it must be  treated as a series of activities (discussion, deliberation and decision making)  linked together through the common modality of negotiative  communication. An analysis of practice guidelines, protocols and key informant  interviews using a critical organizational communication approach evaluates the  extent to which contemporary instances of consultation practice account for the  specificity of stakeholder context, address power and capacity gaps between  consulting organizations, and enables all stakeholders to engage in a negotiative  dialogue that has a direct influence upon the decision-making process of a project.  This thesis argues that operationalizing tenets of a critical communication  framework within consultation practice has the potential to produce the conditions  for conducting a meaningful consultation with community  stakeholders.</description><creator>McCandless, Kaisa M.</creator><date>2002</date><subject>Management -- Employee participation</subject><subject>Industrial management</subject><subject>Corporate governance</subject><title>Beyond the stakeholder paradox : to meaningful consultation with community stakeholders</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3b591910t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3b5919092</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:707958320</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:12:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this study was to identify the sources of stress  experienced by NCAA Division I female ice hockey players at one university.  In-depth, open-ended interviews were carried out with six athletes. The data was  inductively analyzed according to the guidelines set forth by Cote and colleagues  (Cote et al., 1993; Cote et al., 1995). The results of the analysis identified three  main categories of stress: (a) the educational demands included academic concerns  and time concerns; (b) the hockey pressures included the advantages of playing  Division I, hockey performance stressors, training concerns, and the transition to  the NCAA; and (c) the relationship issues included family and significant-other  relationships, "hockey family" relationships, and social concerns. The  connection linking the categories centered on the time concerns and on achieving a  successful balance among the educational, hockey, and social pressures.

According to John D. Caputo, Heidegger does not care for the  "other". This thesis analyzes Caputo's basis for those claims along with  his rejection of Heidegger's notion that our relation to poetizing is needful for an  ethics in a scientific, technological age. Heidegger's ethics of non-objectification  offers hope with regard not only to the domination and oppression of humans but also  for non-humans as well. Heidegger's understanding of 'technique qua metaphysics' is  important for addressing the political claims of Caputo.</description><creator>Harvey, Sharon</creator><contributor>Boutin, Maurice (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Heidegger, Martin, 1889-1976 -- Ethics</subject><subject>Ethics, Modern -- 20th century.</subject><subject>Caputo, John D. -- Ethics</subject><title>Caputo on Heidegger and ethics</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3r074v79m.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/js956g44r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Religious Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):24925</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
