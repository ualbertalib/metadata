We have used Rousseau's Reveries du promeneur solitaire as foundation text in our research. Our corpus is comprised of two works by Gerard de Nerval: Sylvie and Promenades et Souvenirs, as well as George Sand's Lettres d'un voyageur; included also are some exerpts of her Correspondance. We discovered that the experience of Nerval's "promenade" equates to a quest for the past, for freedom and for Nature. He also seeks to escape mental sickness, the burden threatening his inspiration. In George Sand's works, the "promenade" becomes an activity allowing one to overcome familial and sentimental chagrin, a means of regaining a taste for life. In the conclusion we compared the characteristics of the theme as illustrated by both authors, and brought to light their respective peculiarities.</description><creator>Ethier, Nathalie</creator><contributor>Pascal, Gabrielle (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Sand, George, 1804-1876</subject><subject>Nerval, Gérard de, 1808-1855</subject><title>La promenade romantique chez Gérard de Nerval et George Sand /</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w66345002.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w0892c067</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vq27zp62f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:08:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The aim of the thesis is to analyze the Peronist labor movement's role in the Argentine democratic consolidation process. Some scholars, as Valenzuela, have underlined the important role of labor movements in the consolidation of the new democratic regimes emerging from the end of authoritarian rule. This role consists in the moderation of labor's mobilizational activities and militant demands. However, these scholars have not sufficiently emphasized the weakness and the reduced weight of some labor movements after military repression and economic structural transformations. The thesis examines the Argentine case and demonstrates how the several general strikes organized by the CGT during Alfonsin's government did not hinder Argentine democratic consolidation in the short term. The thesis underlines the weakening of the Peronist labor movement and explains its minor role in the consolidation process.</description><creator>Perrault, Anne-Julie</creator><contributor>Oxhorn, Philip (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Labor movement -- Argentina</subject><subject>Argentina -- Politics and government -- 1983-2002</subject><title>The Peronist labor movement and the Alfonsin government : an uneasy relationship for Argentina's democracy (1983-1989)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/08612p84t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vq27zp62f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:np193b25t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:08:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis will analyze the role of Shi'i religious symbols employed in the Iranian revolution of 1979. During the revolution, the Shi'i symbolic structure of the Karbala' paradigm or the symbols of Karbala' and of Husayn's martyrdom were extensively employed to mobilize the masses. Regarded as the Imam and as the symbol of the revolution, Khumayni extensively utilized such religious symbols in order to generate mass revolutionary political consciousness against the Shah's tyrannical regime. In other words, throughout the revolution the traditional 'ashura' mourning ceremony--commemorating a tragic historical event the martyrdom of Husayn who was killed on the battlefield of Karbala' on Muharram 10, 60/680--was transformed into and politicized to be a vehicle of mass revolutionary political mobilization.</description><creator>Fajri, Nurul</creator><contributor>Adams, Charles J.

The historiography of colonial education in AOF has dismissed the education of African girls and women as they were numerically too insignificant to merit any special attention. This study argues that an examination of educational objectives, institutions and curricula provides a rare and valuable window on French colonial discourse on African women. It was a discourse fed by sexism and ethnocentrism, that ultimately intended to refashion women's gender identities and roles to approximate those prescribed by the French ideology of domesticity. The system took the form of a number of domestic sciences training centres that aimed to change the very social definition of what constituted an African woman--to remake her according to the Euro-Christian, patriarchal ideal of mother, wife and housekeeper. Colonial educators argued that such a woman, especially in her role as mother, was the best conduit for the propagation of French mores, practices, and most importantly, submission to French hegemony. The final decades of formal colonial rule in AOF saw the emergence of a small African male bourgeoisie. Members of this class, called "assimiles", accepted to varying degrees French language, lifestyle and values. This study further examines how many of them embraced the ideology of domesticity and became active in the debate on African women's education and the need to control and transform their gender identities.</description><creator>Schulman, Gwendolyn</creator><contributor>Echenberg, Myron (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Education -- France -- Colonies.</subject><subject>Women -- Education -- Africa, French-speaking West</subject><title>Colonial education for African girls in Afrique occidentale française : a project for gender reconstruction, 1819-1960</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7p88ch928.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gh93h078b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bk128c07g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:08:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Membrane proteins specific to cold acclimation were studied in alfalfa (Medicago falcata L. cv Anik) seedlings and cell cultures. They were identified following separation on polyacrylamide gels and localized as far as possible to specific membranes by fractionation on continuous sucrose gradient and analysis of marker enzyme assays. With cold acclimation, certain membrane proteins from seedlings showed subtle changes (mainly increases) in their steady-state amount and in their net synthesis rate. Most of these changes were in proteins with molecular weights below 100 kDa and were associated with light fractions of the sucrose gradient, favoring a Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum or tonoplast location for the proteins. Preliminary work done on membrane proteins from cell cultures showed more pronounced changes with cold acclimation. Most of the changes were in proteins with molecular weights below 100 kDa and were associated with heavy fractions of the sucrose gradient. Since they are easier to harvest and to manipulate, cell cultures appear to be the better system to use in future studies.</description><creator>Bourassa, Hélène</creator><contributor>Dhindsa, R. S.

In 1985 W. J. West published the transcripts of Orwell's wartime broadcasts. West suggested in his introductory preface that Orwell's NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR was based directly on his BBC experience and problems encountered with the Ministry of Information at that time. This thesis argues that, though Orwell probably drew on his BBC experience for the psychological content of NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR, Winston's treatment at the hands of Big Brother is not based on anything the author endured during his tenure at the BBC. To this end Orwell's personal and political reasons for both joining and leaving the BBC are discussed. The connection between reality and fiction in Orwell's works, both documentary and fictional, is examined, and the literary nature of all of Orwell's writing taken into consideration in an exploration of the creative dynamic shaping Orwell's expression.</description><creator>Sallans, Bonnie Jean</creator><contributor>Vogel, Robert (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Orwell, George, 1903-1950.

A qualitative methodology was used to analyse 123 personal documents written between the years 1986 and 1991 by women at or near the end of an intensive bridging program. Analysis of the data revealed that, if provided with a supportive learning environment, women can make significant progress not only towards identifying their goals but in self-development. The study highlights the value of such programs as vehicles for personal and social change. The results of this study also demonstrate the need for continued support for transition programs and an acknowledgement of the untapped capabilities of women.</description><creator>Seabrooke, Lana</creator><contributor>Jackson, Nancy (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Women -- Employment re-entry</subject><title>What re-entry means to women : a case study of documents from a transition-to-work program</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k3569566t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vx021g49h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3484zh93p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:08:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Methodologies have been devised to genotype the $ kappa$-casein ($ kappa$-CN) and $ beta$-lactoglobulin ($ beta$-LG) loci using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) analysis. A fragment of 432 base pair from the $ kappa$-CN gene which contains the nucleotide substitutions diagnostic of the A- and B-alleles of $ kappa$-CN was amplified. DNA amplified from the A-variant contained a unique HinfI restriction site, whereas DNA amplified from the B-variant contained a unique TaqI site. Thus, the genotype of the animal could be determined by restriction enzyme analysis. A region extending from exon IV to V of the $ beta$-LG gene was also amplified using PCR. In this region, the B-allele contains 2 HaeIII restriction sites which are not present in DNA amplified from the A-allele. The digestion of the PCR product with HaeIII thus allowed discrimination between the A- and B-alleles. Analysis of bulls (n = 68) used by artificial insemination (AI) centres after 1980, bulls (n = 27) used before 1960, a random sample of male calves (n = 102) and cows (n = 123) revealed a frequency of the B allele of $ kappa$-CN as 0.13, 0.37, 0.22 and 0.19 in these populations, respectively. In the populations of bulls (n = 69) used by AI centres after 1980, bulls (n = 27) used before 1960, a random sample of male calves (n = 99), and cows (n = 129), the B-allele of $ beta$-LG was present at frequencies of 0.60, 0.52, 0.67, and 0.65, respectively. Statistical analysis of these data shows the frequency of the B-allele of $ kappa$-CN was significantly higher in sires (n = 27) which were used by the AI centre before 1960 compared to more modern proven sires (n = 68) (P $&lt;$ 0.01).</description><creator>Zhou, Jiang-Feng, 1964-</creator><contributor>Zadworny, D.

It is concerned with the recognized human need for self-affirmation and with the consequences of its denial caused by exile. For the victim this means the loss of social interaction and public moral agency within his natural community through which self-affirmation can be actualized. In certain types of exilic literature constructive reactions were found to counteract this loss of freedom of choice of action and place, which entails potential annihilation of the exile's personal integrity. In the exilic text of Dante as my chosen case study, I investigate the use of philosophical and literary means admitting of various kinds of self-referential expressions and of similacra of moral agency as substitutes for self-affirmation by public acts. Stimulated by these means, an intellectual and moral 'self-portrait' of the poet eventually emerges in the reader's consciousness. This 'portrait' is no static image of a pre-existent character, but a dynamic presence of an evolving human person of intellectual and moral integrity, as a reflection of the poet's self-perception. By sample analyses and comparisons, my exposition substantiates the claim that Dante's text exemplifies the distinct and identifiable literary mode to which I refer as 'Exilic Discourse'.</description><creator>Auersperg, Ruth E.</creator><contributor>Walker, Jeremy (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Discourse analysis, Literary</subject><subject>Literature -- Philosophy</subject><subject>Dante Alighieri, 1265-1321 -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><subject>Exiles' writings -- History and criticism</subject><title>Dante : exilic discourse as self-constitution</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2r36tz87h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cv43nz33j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Philosophy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x633f248w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:08:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In the works published by Valentin Kataev after 1966, his own past is reflected consistently. This tempts the reader and critic to interpret them as memoirs. However, such a label is too narrow and thus inaccurate. For Kataev, the past stimulates his imagination, and memory is the relentless, uncontrollable retriever of previous times. Rather than a factual resurrection of Kataev's past, his prose of this period is an adorned recreation. The critical "thaw", that followed Stalin's death, permitted the expression of sincere emotion in Soviet literature; sincere, in the sense that suffering that resulted from the implementation of the new plan could be revealed in prose and poetry. Kataev accepted this opportunity.

This study suggests that, under these created environments, dwelling evolution presented particular characteristics that differentiated it from similar processes in other contexts. A long-term assessment of the phenomenon of dwelling evolution was conducted at "El Gallo", a progressive development project in Ciudad Guayana, Venezuela. Dwelling evolution was examined by observing aspects of the process that were relevant to the case study. These included changes in the dwelling area, spatial configuration and functional layout. The case study provided different levels of user participation in the early stages of development that were also considered in the analysis. The findings indicated a marked change from the temporary dwelling to the permanent structure. This process differed from the gradual replacement of initial shacks that is characteristic of informal settlements. The findings also revealed that the early involvement of the user, as well as the utilization of user-responsive designs for the permanent structure, resulted in lesser stages of dwelling evolution and higher degrees of dwelling development.</description><creator>Reimers, Carlos A.</creator><contributor>Bhatt, Vikram (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Architecture, Domestic -- Venezuela -- Ciudad Guayana -- Case studies</subject><subject>Housing development -- Venezuela -- Ciudad Guayana -- Case studies</subject><subject>Housing -- Venezuela -- Ciudad Guayana -- Case studies</subject><title>Evolution of dwellings in progressive development projects : case study El Gallo, Ciudad Guayana</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j098zc32z.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nz806104r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fb4949719</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:08:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Heat dissipation from silicon chips is becoming critical as a result of increasing circuit density and power applied to these chips. In this regard, aluminum nitride (AlN) is the most promising candidate to be used as a substrate since it possesses high a thermal conductivity and thermal expansion coefficient close to that of silicon. In addition, metal-ceramic interfaces determine the heat dissipation through a circuit. In order to minimize the effect of interfaces, direct bonding (DB) of AlN to Cu was studied. DB process has been reported to provide a low thermal barrier and an interface which is free of thermal fatigue. In this work process parameters of DB were optimized based on time, temperature and thickness of the Cu-foil for Cu-Al$ sb2$O$ sb3$ system in a N$ sb2$ atmosphere containing 500 ppm O$ sb2$ in a temperature range of 1065 to 1075$ sp circ$C. These conditions were then applied to the Cu-AlN system. Wettability of AlN by Cu was studied and improved through oxidation of AlN and modification of Cu by adding 1 at.% O$ sb2$. The activation energy for oxidation of AlN was found to be 94 kJ/mol. It was then shown that direct bonding of Cu to AlN can be performed without any intermediate layer. The average peel strength of AlN-Cu, A$ sb2$O$ sb3$-Cu and AlN-Al$ sb2$O$ sb3$-Cu systems were measured to be 42, 49 and 14.7 MPa, respectively.</description><creator>Entezarian, Majid</creator><contributor>Drew, R.

Mixtures having various polyethylene/polystyrene ratios were reacted in a stirred, batch reactor under a nitrogen atmosphere at moderate temperatures, ranging between 350 and 420$ sp circ$C. The major products collected included a volatile product, which was liquid at room temperature, and a wax-like residue. The liquid products were consistently found to contain over 90 percent styrene and toluene with the yield of styrene decreasing as the percentage of polyethylene in the mixture increased. Two fractions were identified in the residue: a high molecular weight polyethylene fraction and a lower molecular weight polystyrene fraction. A significant increase in the solubility of the residue in organic solvents at room temperature was observed as the polystyrene content was raised. The residue became completely soluble in chloroform at a 60/40 ratio of polyethylene/polystyrene. The effect of temperature on the degradation of a selected mixture was also investigated. At temperatures below 390$ sp circ$C, the volatile/residue ratio was independent of the reaction temperature. Above 390$ sp circ$C, the styrene and total liquid product yields increased with increasing temperature, while the yield of residue decreased.</description><creator>Lageraaen, Paul R.

This continues in the postmodern era, in which the culturally dominant postmodern aesthetic has declared the death of the social, narrative and affect, all intrinsic to the popular feminine narrative. Nevertheless, these narratives persevere in such forms as the daytime television soap opera. Using a reader-oriented model, American soap operas are discussed as a site for the generation of women's pleasure, and as a forum for the raising, sharing and addressing of problems which affect women's lives. Soap opera fan magazines further extend the already social soap opera experience, which celebrates emotion and empathy in a culture which often negates them.</description><creator>Mark, Amanda</creator><contributor>Marchessault, Janine (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Massumi, Brian (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Television soap operas -- United States -- History and criticism.</subject><title>Soap opera subculture : emotional realism and empathic identification</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0r9674964.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kp78gh54m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fj236328h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:08:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Several of the inborn errors of vitamin B$ sb{12}$ (cobalamin, Cbl) metabolism (cblC, cblD, cblE, cblF, cblG) are associated with homocystinuria and hypomethioninemia due to a functional deficiency of the cytoplasmic enzyme methionine synthase which requires methylcobalamin (MeCbl) as a cofactor. We compared the growth of cultured fibroblasts from controls with those from patients with a selective deficiency of MeCbl (cblE and cblG) and with those from patients with a defect in both MeCbl and adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) (cblC, cblD and cblF). Cells were grown in methionine and folic acid free media and in fully supplemented medium. Control cells were able to grow in the deficient medium supplied with homocysteine, cobalamin and folate, while mutant cells were not, due to their inability to synthesize methionine from its immediate metabolic precursor, homocysteine. This differential growth is useful for screening for genetic defects of methionine biosynthesis. Moreover, by correcting methionine auxotrophy in these cells, it may be possible to isolate genes which code for the products that are deficient in these disorders.</description><creator>Kocic, Vesna Garovic</creator><contributor>Rosenblatt, D.

It was found that in the Quichua theory, illness is primarily attributed to nature spirits or malignant spirits under human control and modulated by the experience of intense emotions like fear, anger, and sadness. Clinical evaluation (including Zung's depression scale) indicates that patients labelled llaqui are suffering from mental disorders and physical diseases. Eighty-two percent of patients made the DSM III-R criteria for depressive disorders; 44% for somatoform disorders; and 40% for anxiety disorders. Some 80% of them were also suffering from infectious and parasitic diseases. It is important for health practitioners working with this population to become familiar with this illness belief system and to known the relationship between llaqui and mental disorders, because it should improve the quality of medical care.</description><creator>Maldonado, Mario G.</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Psychology, Clinical.</subject><subject>Folklore.</subject><title>Llaqui et dépression : une étude exploratoire chez les Quichuas (équateur)</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t722hb05t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x059c876k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychiatry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:765372405</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:08:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Hydraulic retention time (HRT) might contribute to the substantial variation in phosphorus-chlorphyll and chlorophyll-zooplankton models because rapid flushing might depress plankton development. However, for a world-wide data set. HRT was not correlated with chlorophyll. Total phosphorus had no effect on chlorphyll when hypereutrophic sites were considered separately, but chlorophyll was negatively related to HRT. Short term HRT, averaged over periods up to one month, was not correlated with chlorophyll, or zooplankton biomass, in seven impoundments on the St. Lawrence and Ottawa Rivers. The size distribution of algae was not affected by HRT. The proportion of rotifer to total zooplankton biomass was positively related to HRT, but this trend disappeared when nauplius biomass was removed from the total. These results indicate that rapid flushing does not necessarily reduce planktonic biomass and that short term HRT is not useful for the prediction and management of planktonic biomass in these systems.</description><creator>Thompson, Lisa C.</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Streamflow.</subject><subject>Freshwater plankton.</subject><subject>Eutrophication.</subject><subject>Phosphorus.</subject><title>The influence of hydraulic retention time on planktonic biomass in lakes and reservoirs /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f7623d83k.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/765372405</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jh343t458</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:08:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is concerned with an examination of the reliability of R-DAT recording media in regard to professional and archival applications.

The indirect and direct contact the Dene had with the European traders and Christian missionaries who came to their land around the turn of the 20th century triggered profound changes in their society and economy. This study focuses on some of these changes, and, particularly, on how they have affected the lives of Dene women who inhabit the small community of Fort Liard, which is located in the southwest corner of the Northwest Territories. Using as context the formal and informal economy and the concept of the model of production, the author proposes two main ideas: first, "nurturing" or "social reproduction" and "providing" or "production" are vital and integral to the Dene's subsistence economy and concept of work; second, it is through the custom of "seclusion" or female puberty rites that the teaching and learning of these responsibilities occurred. Dene women played a pivotal role in this process. The impositions of external government, Christianity, capitalism, and free market economics have altered Dene women's concept of work. The Dene women of Fort Liard are presently working to regain the social and economic status they once had. However, reclaiming their status in current times involves recognizing conflicting and contradictory ideologies in the workplace. The goal of these Dene women is, ultimately, to overcome economic and ideological obstacles, to reinforce common cultural values, and to reaffirm the primacy of their own conceptions of family and community. The goal of this study is to identify and examine the broad spectrum of factors and conditions that play a role in their struggles.</description><creator>Nahanni, Phoebe</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Indian women -- Northwest Territories.</subject><subject>Tinne Indians -- Social life and customs</subject><title>Dene women in the traditional and modern northern economy in Denendeh, Northwest Territories, Canada</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fq977w26h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9k41zf66n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:r207tq57g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:08:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The literary and socio-political environments of early nineteenth-century America demanded from Hawthorne a new formulation of the allegorical mode, which in turn afforded him means to critique that same historical situation. His metonymic and realistic uses of allegorical techniques invert the emphasis of traditional allegory, permitting him subversively to critique the idealist principles of contemporary historiography and the Transcendentalist movement. Hawthorne's discontent with antebellum historiography's conflation of the Puritan colonists and the Revolutionary fathers, and with Transcendentalism's disregard for the darker side of human nature, led him to critique these idealisms in his fictions. His appropriation of allegorical conventions allowed him to enact this critique subversively, without alienating the increasingly nationalistic American reading public. This subversive program exerts a global influence on Hawthorne's work. The first chapter of this thesis defines my use of the term "allegory." The second situates Hawthorne within the allegorical tradition, the third within the American ideological context. The last two chapters identify and discuss Hawthorne's appropriations of the allegorical conventions of personification and procession as they are found in each of the three forms in which he most commonly wrote: the sketch, the tale, and the historical romance.</description><creator>Folkerth, Wes, 1964-</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Hawthorne, Nathaniel, 1804-1864 -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><title>Nathaniel Hawthorne's subversive use of allegorical conventions</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dv13zv56h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r207tq57g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kk91fm917</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:08:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis shows the condition of outsidedness in the fiction of two Indo-English authors: Ruth Prawer Jhabvala and Salman Rushdie. Ruth Prawer Jhabvala focuses on the intercultural encounter from the European perspective. Salman Rushdie writes from the expatriate's point of view. Astride the cultural frameworks of India and the West at once they examine the ironic similarities of prejudice and intolerance in both societies. These authors' novels are examined through concepts elaborated by the Russian literary theoretician, Mikhail Bakhtin, such as exotopy or outsidedness, heteroglossia, dialogism, etc. They confirm Bakhtin's contention that cultural confrontation is a potentially enriching source of literary and artistic creation. Jhabvala treats the intercultural encounter within the colonial and post-colonial frameworks and shows the fragile dialogue that does occur between her European characters and India. Rushdie on the other hand centres mainly on contemporary India although he does satirize certain aspects of colonial India. He uses a plethora of historical, literary, cultural and linguistic referents from both eastern and western traditions to subvert the hegemonic discourse of either and to celebrate cultural hybridity.</description><creator>Lanthier, Lalita Bharvani</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Rushdie, Salman -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><subject>Jhabvala, Ruth Prawer, 1927- -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><title>Two outsiders in Indo-English literature : Ruth Prawer Jhabvala and Salman Rushdie</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7s75dd675.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kk91fm917</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5712m7822</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:08:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of earlier corn (Zea mays L.) harvest, on corn yield, intercrop growth, and soil N levels, and to evaluate the effects of red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) compared to ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) as intercrops on corn yield and soil N levels. After two years, earlier corn harvest did not result in greater intercrop growth or higher soil N levels compared with later corn harvest and there was no significant soil N contribution by legume intercrops in either harvest period. Thus, no soil N benefit was found from using intercrops in earlier harvest for silage compared to later harvest for grain corn, nor from using red clover compared to ryegrass as an intercrop. In the early harvested silage system, a quadratic corn yield response to added N suggested that near-maximum corn dry matter yields were obtained at the rate of 140 kg N ha$ sp{-1}$. Maximum total dry matter yields were not obtained in the late harvest grain system in any site-year.

China's decision to accept FDI came with the arrival of a new political leadership set upon the pursuit of radically different economic policies following the Cultural Revolution. The new leadership sought to take China on the quickest route to modernization while still remaining loyal to the socialist state. Therefore, while the Chinese Constitution insists on public ownership as the basis of the economy, it also recognizes and encourages other forms of economic activity which benefit the national economy. This reform process led to an enlarged private sector and considerable FDI. That process continues today as the Chinese legal system moves further towards the promotion and protection of foreign investment and international norms of economic behaviour. This thesis examines the development of China's legal regime regarding foreign investment. It will highlight distinctive features of that regime such as the enactment of laws by both national and regional governments. The thesis will also examine how the opening to FDI has resulted in increased interest in international law by the Chinese government. With considerable speed, China has recognized and adhered to international treaties regarding foreign investment since the end of the Cultural Revolution. Finally, this thesis will analyze the many difficulties surrounding FDI in China today. Managing foreign investment in a centrally planned economy has led to many legal, political, social, and economic problems. The focus of this analysis will be on legal difficulties concerning FDI which are of particular concern to foreign investors.</description><creator>Yan, Xiaoqing</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Law.</subject><title>Regulation of foreign investment in Chinese law</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3j333345d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z603qz740</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6395w860m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:08:14Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis deals with the technical and legal aspects arising out of the envisaged implementation of Aeronautical Mobile Satellite Services (AMSS) for civil aviation purposes, such as communication, navigation and surveillance. After a short introduction to the subject, Part A of this thesis will deal with the technical side of the subject and will introduce the reader to the current CNS/ATM-concept and its deficiencies (Chapter 1), and to the future CNS/ATM-concept and its benefits (Chapter 2). Part B will discuss the legal aspects of the implementation of AMSS for civil aviation purposes. Starting from the legal aspects of AMSS with respect ot the law of outer space (Chapter 3), it will explain the current regime of telecommunications developed by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and its impact on AMSS (Chapter 4). Then, the legal aspects of AMSS with respect to international public air law (Chapter 5) will be examined and some predominant issues with respect to the appropriate institutional framework to implement AMSS will be discussed (Chapter 6).
