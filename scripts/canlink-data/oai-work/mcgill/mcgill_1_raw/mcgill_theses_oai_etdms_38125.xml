These three members contain multiple protein binding domains and lack enzymatic activity. Extensive two-hybrid studies have demonstrated binding of Grb10 to numerous activated tyrosine kinase receptors including the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR), as well as many non-receptor molecules such as MEK1, Raf-1, and Nedd4. Grb10 has been implicated in IGF-I anti-apoptotic signaling regulation through interactions with Raf-1 and the mitochondrial membrane. In this report the pattern of transient Grb10 translocation following IGF-I cellular stimulation was studied. This report also demonstrates the implication of a short variable amino-terminal region of Grb10 in mitochondrial membrane association. Finally, assays were developed with the goal of identifying new Grb10 binding partners.</description><creator>Hassard, Jennifer.</creator><contributor>Thomas, David (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Apoptosis.</subject><subject>Insulin -- Receptors.</subject><subject>Insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins.</subject><title>Mitochondrial membrane binding and protein complexing of the anti-apoptotic adaptor protein Grb10</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sq87bw314.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5138jg63k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8k71nj93w</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:48:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Vernalized celery seedlings (Apium graveolens L. var. Florida 683) were predevernalized under different temperature and light regimes prior to field transplanting. At least 89% of predevernalized plants bolted during both 1999 and 2000 suggesting that the predevernalization treatments were not effective in counteracting the vernalizing stimulus. Predevernalization treatments had no long-term effect on growth and development. Non-vernalized celery seedlings were transplanted on clear polyethylene mulch, thermo-selective polyethylene mulch or no mulch in combination with clear perforated polyethylene mini tunnel, single or double layer of agrotextile mini tunnel or no mini tunnel. Very few plants bolted in 1999. Mulch increased fresh weight and number of celery leaves compared with controls. Plants grown on clear polyethylene mulch had significantly higher mortality rates than other treatments. Agrotextile mini tunnels reduced bolting to 0% in 2000. Mini tunnels, especially a single layer of agrotextile, increased fresh weight, plant height and stem diameter in 2000.</description><creator>Cote, John Christopher.</creator><contributor>Stewart, Katrine A.

The objective of this study was to characterize the expression and regulation of PGHS-2 in porcine follicles prior to ovulation. The combination of equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG; 750 IU) followed by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; 500 IU) 72 h later was used to induce ovulation in prepubertal gilts. Previous studies have shown that ovulation is generally induced between 40 and 44 h post-hCG in this model. Ovariectomies were performed at 0, 24, 30, 34 and 38 h post-hCG (n = 4 or 5 animals per time-point), and all follicles larger than 4 mm in diameter were isolated. The regulation of PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 proteins was studied by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses, whereas the regulation of PGHS-2 mRNA was studied by Northern blot. PG production was assessed by radioimmunoassay (RIA).

This radar was used in the AIRS (Alliance Icing Research Study) experiment held at Mirabel Airport from November 1999 to February 2000. For cases where conditions favor the formation of drizzle drops with a diameter sufficiently large, a second mode with a distinct speed and reflectivity can be separated from that received from snow. That the second mode corresponds to supercooled drizzle is verified by comparing reflectivities and speeds with aircraft data taken during AIRS. For cases without bimodality, regions of icing may be localized by a computation of the mass flux gradient. Accretion of supercooled water on snow (riming) increases both its density and fall speed. Thus, a sudden increase in snow fall speed indicates the presence of supercooled water. A conceptual model describing necessary conditions for the formation of supercooled drizzle is proposed. This model is based on the analysis of a synoptic situation present for two days of intense icing.</description><creator>Côté, Chantal.</creator><contributor>Fabry, Frederic (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</subject><title>Detection of supercooled drizzle by a vertically pointing radar</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nv935475g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cr56n2971</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xk81jn29q</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:48:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The McGill University S-Band radar has been upgraded in 1999 to dual-polarization capability. The transmission and reception of horizontally and vertically polarized electromagnetic waves provide new parameters that are sensitive to the hydrometeor shapes and other characteristics in the radar resolution volume. As a result, the retrieval of microphysical properties of weather events can be improved. In this work, we studied the reliability of the polarization data obtained by the fast scanning radar. Measurements from different precipitation systems are analyzed to study how this new information can be exploited for operational purposes. The work done shows a great potential for particle typing and microphysical retrievals.

Regulations limiting P accumulation in surface soils have been established to protect surface water quality. Yet, little information is available on the quantities of P that may leach through soils and the factors influencing P leaching in agricultural soils. One important factor may be the type of fertilizer P applied, since it is known that P solubility varies among fertilizer sources. The purpose of this thesis was to quantify P leaching in soils amended with inorganic and organic fertilizers. In a field study, we found that the fertilizer P source (triple superphosphate, composted cattle manure, or a mixture of the two) did not affect soil test P concentration, the degree of soil P saturation, or P leaching in a sandy-loam soil. The soil test P level in the 0--15-cm depth (146 mg P kg -1) exceeded the critical limit of 66-mg kg-1 established in Quebec, and ortho-P and DOP concentrations in leachates collected from piezometers were generally higher than the provincial water quality standard of 0.03 mg P L-1. If transported from our study site, P leached through this coarse-textured soil could pose a threat to groundwater and surface water quality. These findings were verified in the laboratory with two coarse-textured soils. We found that more NO3-N and DON were leached from soils receiving inorganic N and P fertilizers than composted cattle manure, but the amounts of ortho-P and DOP leached were not affected by fertilizer sources. In coarse-textured soils, the quantities of P leached can be substantial, but depends more on soil characteristics than the fertilizer P source.</description><creator>Carefoot, Janna.</creator><contributor>Whalen, J.

Field and laboratory studies were conducted to determine the treatment capacity of a constructed wetland system and to determine a substrate that would be most efficient as a phosphorus adsorption filter. The wetland system consisted of three free-water surface cells, three blast furnace slag filters and a vegetated filter strip, treating municipal wastewater. Bimonthly water samples at the inlet and outlet of each component of the wetland system were analysed for biochemical oxygen demand, nitrate and nitrite, ammonia and ammonium, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, total suspended solids, total phosphorus, ortho-phosphate, fecal coliforms and E. coli. Phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations were determined in the sediment, plant tissue and water column of the free-surface wetland cells. The free-surface wetland cells achieved removals as follows: ammonia and ammonium (52%), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (37%), total suspended solids (93%), total phosphorus (90%) and ortho-phosphate (82%). The vegetated filter strip achieved removals as follows: ammonia and ammonium (28%), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (11%), total suspended solids (22%), total phosphorus (5%) and ortho-phosphate (0%). The slag filters reduced total phosphorus by more than 99%. Phosphorus adsorption measurements were conducted on slag, calcite and shale. Slag was found to be the most effective at removing phosphate.</description><creator>Cameron, Kimberley A.</creator><contributor>Madramootoo, C. A.

PTHRP is known to mediate the complication of malignancy known as hypercalcemia. In recent years focus on PTHRP has moved away from its roles in hypercalcemia of malignancy and has since been seen to modulate the proliferation and differentiation of a number of cell types. We have investigated the mechanisms of PTHRP action in the induction of osteoblast cell differentiation, using the osteoblast-derived osteosarcoma cell line, MG-63. Upon treatment of MG-63 cells for 8 hours with 100 nM PTHRP (1--34), maximum induction of markers of osteoblast differentiation was observed by Northern blot and histochemical analysis. Using chemical inhibitors of signal transduction targeted against adenylate cyclase, protein kinase C, PI3 kinase, Ras farnesylation, and MAPK, we have investigated the signaling pathways involved in the induction of these markers of differentiation. Transient transfection of a mutant form of Galpha also served to investigate the mechanisms of signal transduction involved in our model of osteoblast differentiation. Collectively, we have shown that multiple signaling pathways are involved in the induction of markers of osteoblast differentiation by PTHRP, acting via the classical PTH/PTHRP G protein coupled receptor.</description><creator>Carpio, Luisa.</creator><contributor>Rabbani, Shafaat A.

This study consisted of testing and implementing a beta-gamma attenuation correction technique on an animal PET scanner. In its final form the system uses 68Ge sources enclosed in plastic scintillator cylinders coupled to PMTs. The detection of positrons is activated by the energy loss in the scintillator medium.

Malignancy is characterized by loss of the differentiated phenotype and uncontrolled cell growth, therefore investigating the activin signalling pathways and the mechanisms by which it regulates its biological functions have important implications for tumourigenesis. In my project, I investigated the role of activin on cell differentiation and growth inhibition in different tumoural cell lines. Our results indicate that activin is a potent inducer of cellular differentiation in transformed cell lines of erythroid origin. Furthermore, our studies also indicate that activin is an inhibitor of cell growth in both the erythroleukemia K562 and hepatoma HepG2 cell lines. Proliferation studies indicate that activin mediates its anti-proliferative effects by upregulating the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDIs), p15Ink4 and p21cip1/Waf1, which in turn, induce cell cycle arrest. The activin-mediated transcriptional induction of p15Ink4b gene promoter requires the two transcription factors, Sp1or Fast-1, and is mediated through Smad2, 3 and 4. TGFbeta, however, only requires the presence of Sp1 to induce the p15Ink4b gene promoter, highlighting for the first time a difference in the signalling pathways of the two related growth factors, activin and TGFbeta. In addition to Sp1 and Fast-l, the involvement of the co-activator MSG-1 in the activin signalling pathway was also studied and preliminary results indicate that MSG-1 can increase activin's induction of target genes, suggesting that MSG-1 may have a potentiating effect in the regulation of activin's biological effects.</description><creator>Kim, Christie, 1975-</creator><contributor>Lebrun, J.

This technological revolution is illustrated notably by the way in which more and more sectors of society increasingly make use of the Internet. The business sector has found enormous potential in electronic communication for improving and increasing commercial transactions. This thesis studies the legal questions posed by the use of the Internet as a basis of contractual agreements and business relationships. The way in which on-line contracts are drawn up and agreed upon brings factors into play which are outside the scope of the established rules. Whereas traditional contracts derive their essential legality from written documents, this is not so in on-line transactions. In the same way, the on-line environment poses problems of contract security and confidentiality which do not exist in a traditional environment. The Internet is in essence a transnational virtual environment where there are no frontiers. The establishment of laws to govern contracts made on the Internet thus becomes an essential factor in determining the security and development of on-line transactions. This thesis analyses the North-American and French approaches as well as international rules concerning the new legal questions posed by on-line transactions. On the one hand, it must be determined if business transactions are compatible with on-line environment and, on the other hand, if any parity exists or indeed should be sought.</description><creator>Bouffartigue, Iris.</creator><contributor>Janda, Richard (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</subject><subject>Law.</subject><subject>Mass Communications.</subject><title>Les contrats sur l'internet : un point de vue international: les approches nord-americaine et française</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vm40xt55q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sb397994c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hh63sx667</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:48:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Neuronal networks are specified by unique wiring patterns, however, it is not clear how these patterns are encoded into topographic maps of synaptic connections. We found networks in vitro and in vivo , where multiple-neurites converge and intersect at single sites non-randomly. At these sites, the density and activity of axonal terminals increased exponentially with the number of converging neurites. Multiple-neurite intersections were formed by a directed growth of neurites toward neurite intersections, they facilitated target switching by axons, and their frequency was elevated by activity through NMDA and AMPA glutamate receptors.

The results indicate that only the length of formal supervision is significant in reducing emotional exhaustion in social workers (p &lt; .05). Higher education levels were also seen as a protective factor against depersonalization (n = 16).</description><creator>Walker, Michelle Marie.</creator><contributor>John, L.

It is expressed in growth-arrested cells, such as quiescent and senescent human fibroblasts but not in their replicating counterparts (Wang, 1985a), and in terminally differentiated cells (Muggleton-Harris et al., 1989). Hence, statin is a useful marker for nonproliferation and suppressed growth. On the other hand, transformed cells are statin negative. A WI-38 cDNA library was screened for potential statin clones using the antistatin antibody S44. Clone S44-I was obtained and sequence analysis demonstrated that it shows 99.9% homology to the human C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal (hPTS1). Northern blot analysis revealed that it is expressed not only in quiescent and senescent, but also in replicating WI-38 as well as in transformed cells. These results suggest that the expression of S44-I is not cell-cycle-arrested-specific. In vitro translation of S44-I using 35S labeled L-methionine demonstrated that it encodes for a 71 kDa protein which is consistent with the size of the open reading frame (ORF). Moreover, S44-I was transiently transfected and Western blot analysis revealed that S44-I encodes for the expected 71 kDa protein in addition to an 80 kDa polypeptide. Mutation of potential initiation methionines of S44-I for possible alternate initiation of translation mechanism did not eliminate any of the two proteins. In conclusion, these findings are not consistent with previous studies that have analyzed statin at the protein level. This implies that S44-I does not encode for statin but for the hPTS1 or a related member which may possess a shared antigenic epitope recognizable by the anti-statin antibody.</description><creator>Proestou, Gregory.</creator><contributor>Wang, Eugenia (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Molecular characterization of clone S44-I, that encodes for a protein antigenically related to statin</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j3860867f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4q77ft196</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3b591b144</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:48:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In the summer of 1997, 217 fishes of different species (Raja erinacea, R. radiata, R. ocellata, Malacoraja senta, and Squalus acanthias) were collected from the West Isles of the Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick. Parasites belonging to 13 species were found: 10 Cestoda; 2 Nematoda; and 1 Acanthocephala. Of the 10 cestodes, five are described as new species. The remaining five re-described in detail and compared to similar worms reported in the literature. None of the eight tetraphyllidean cestodes was found in more than one host species, thereby supporting current dogma that the Tetraphyllidea are species specific with respect to their definitive hosts. There is a close relationship between the topography of the spiral-valve mucosa of the preferred attachment-site and that of the inner-bothridial tegument.

It begins from the formal definitions of the string-to-string/weight transducers. Then, three determinization algorithms have been developed. It includes SSW_determinization algorithm only for the complete determinization of the determinizable transducers (AT&amp;T determinization software fsmdeterminize has been successfully reproduced by this algorithm), the partial determinization algorithm PSSW_determinization for the determinization of the non-determinizable transducers, and DSSW_determinization algorithm for the determinization on the demand. These algorithms has been implemented, and a functional test (including ASR test) of these determinization programs has also been carried on. The advantages and disadvantages of these algorithms have been discussed and analyzed. Special attention has been paid to the DSSW_determinization . The DSSW_determinization can be applied to the determinization of both determinizable and non-determinizable transducers, and it has a very low memory cost compared with that of the SSW_determinization and PSSW_determinization.</description><creator>Qiu, Jun, 1966-</creator><contributor>Dumouchel, Pierre (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Ratzer, Gerald (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Determinization of string-to-stringweight finite state transducers in speech recognition</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pg15bg83t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2j62s654k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z603r0288</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:48:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Fourier-Mellin transform was implemented on a digital computer and applied towards the recognition and differentiation of images of plant leaves regardless of translation, rotation or scale.

It has been suggested that dually diagnosed patients are inadequately treated for both disorders and that they are problematic from a diagnostic, clinical management and economic perspective. Dual Diagnosis (DD) maybe associated with a number of issues including increased aggression, increased non-compliance with medication (Swartz, 1998), and exacerbated psychopathology (Tomasson, 1997). However, contradictory evidence has also been found (Leon, 1998), which suggests that patients with DD may be a higher functioning population of mentally ill patients. The objectives of the present study were to determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of dual diagnosis patients in a chronic psychiatric population. A sample of 217 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders was randomly sampled from the psychiatric facilities of the Montreal General Hospital. Almost half of the sample presented with comorbid addictive disorders; the most common drugs abused were alcohol, cannabis and cocaine. Those patients who had a lifetime diagnosis of substance abuse or dependence were more likely to be male, had a more severe course of psychiatric illness, higher rates of psychiatric symptomology, were more likely to be tobacco smokers and had higher rates of non-compliance with psychiatric medications. Further analyses revealed lower levels of social support and more legal problems in patients with DD, all of which may negatively impact on the quality of care for dual diagnosis patients in the clinical setting.</description><creator>Malchy, Leslie.</creator><contributor>Gill, K.

The present study evaluated a health promotion intervention aimed at travel agents to encourage them to refer at-risk travellers to travel health clinics. Information on the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours of travel agents before and after the intervention was compared using two self-administered questionnaires. Proportions of first-time attendees of travel clinics reporting referral by a travel agent were monitored in order to detect post-intervention changes. Evaluation of the intervention revealed a small improvement in travel agents' overall attitudes and beliefs (p = 0.03), in particular their intention to refer (p = 0.01). Sixty-five percent of travel agents self-reported an increase in referral behaviour; owners or managers of the agency were significantly more likely to do so than other travel agents (OR = 7.25; 95% CI: 1.64, 32.06). Older travel agents, those that worked longer hours and those with some past referral experience had significantly higher post-intervention scores. The proportion of travellers attending a travel health clinic who had been referred by a travel agent did not increase over the course of the study. Education of travel agents early in their training is required to underscore the need for clinic referrals and to ensure routine referral of all at-risk travellers. Travel agents can be willing partners in referring travellers to travel health clinics and agencies should be encouraged to develop specific referral policies.</description><creator>MacDougall, Laura A.</creator><contributor>Gyorkos, Theresa W.

An execution of a message-passing system is nondeterministic when message races exist. Message race occurs when, e.g., multiple conflicting requests from different clients are competing to be executed within a server entity. Therefore, techniques for race detection by tracing messages are an essential part of a test and debugging tool for distributed concurrent systems. In this thesis, race conditions are investigated in the context of the Testing and Monitoring Tool (TMT). TMT is a monitoring and testing tool for distributed software systems, which is developed by the Department of Software Engineering, Corporate Technology (ZT SE), Siemens AG, Munich, Germany. An existing method is used to determine the race set for each receive event in the trace from a single execution. Race sets indicate the potential races in a system run that may happen. The execution of the program is deterministic if and only if all race sets of the program execution are empty. The method is detailed, implemented in Java and integrated in the TMT tool. A trace comparison method is developed that determines whether races actually occurred during two particular executions of the same system. If the race set for a receive event in the first trace is equal to the race set of the matching receive event in the second trace, a race did not happen for this receive event, otherwise, a race happened. The method is also implemented in Java and integrated in the TMT tool. The GUI of the developed prototype tool is presented and the tool is illustrated on an example.</description><creator>Lu, Rong, 1969-</creator><contributor>Petrenko, Alexandre (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Detecting race conditions in distributed concurrent systems</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7h149r45c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d504rn108</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:m039k685n</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:48:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The WT1 gene encodes a transcription factor that is involved in the etiology of the nephroblastoma, Wilms' Tumor, and its associated diseases. Protein-protein interactions have been shown to alter the transcription regulatory functions of WT1 and implicate WT1 in the post-transcriptional event, splicing. Modulation of WT1 activity by its interacting partner and vice versa can extend the functional capacity of both proteins. A new potential WT1-interacting protein, Bone Marrow Zinc Finger 2 (BMZF2 or ZNF255), was isolated by affinity chromatography from HeLa cell nuclear extracts and subsequently identified by mass spectrometry analysis. Amino acid sequence analysis of BMZF2 suggests that it is a potential transcription factor with DNA-binding abilities. GST pulldown experiments indicate that BMZF2 binds the zinc finger region of the WT1 (-KTS) isoform in vitro. Because BMZF2 targets the WT1 (-KTS) zinc finger domain, it may be capable of influencing WT1's transcriptional regulatory functions. The expression patterns of BMZF2 and WT1 suggest that they may be important to the regulation of mammalian development and hematopoiesis.</description><creator>Lwu, Shelly, 1976-</creator><contributor>Pelletier, Jerry (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Isolation and identification of a novel putative WTI-interacting protein</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jq085n083.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m039k685n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ks65hd98x</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:48:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Systems management represents the set of activities necessary to ensure that information systems function according to user requirements and objectives. Chapter 1 summarizes the management challenges in today's networks and distributed systems. Policy-driven network management is the new management paradigm. Its implementation needs a new information and decision model, appropriate protocols and new hosting and access mechanisms. IETF policy framework and architecture create the support for the deployment of this new paradigm. Consideration of temporal aspects to allow run-time policy conflict detection and error-handling has not yet been developed. After assessing the existing policy-oriented achievements in terms of tools and IETF drafts, and after presenting existing temporal mechanisms, we concluded that only policy definition temporal issues are partially referred to. We considered complementary temporal issues focusing on "policy execution" and coping with the notions of time zones, policy dependency across multiple time zones and actions translation among many time zones. Finally, we showed how our input can be used for extending the current IETF Policy CIM proposal. We intend to have an IETF draft on these issues. Specifically, our proposal can be added as a new building block to any existing policy-enabled management tool. We identified important directions in handling policy conflicts at run-time.</description><creator>Dini, Manuela-Ionelia.</creator><contributor>Ratzer, Gerald (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Temporal-oriented policy-driven network management</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cv43nz973.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hd98x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1g05fd568</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:48:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Although several enzymes presumed to be part of the delignification/kraft pulp biobleaching system of the white-rot basidiomycete Trametes versicolor have been studied, characterized, and even exploited as pulp treatments, the complete system remains poorly understood. Little is known about which enzymes are essential for delignification, how they are regulated, or whether there remain unknown enzymes essential to wood decay in this system. Auxotrophic mutants of T. versicolor 52J were developed and characterized. Plasmid pUC18 was complemented with the T. versicolor 52J genome to create a gene library. Transformation with this plasmid-gene library converted argB and ade2 auxotrophs of T. versicolor 52J to prototrophy. Attempts to rescue the plasmids responsible were unsuccessful. Several different pre-existing plasmid constructs were examined for their potential as selectable markers on the fungus. One of these, pGPhT, worked well at conferring phleomycin resistance. Given that there are now available partial or complete sequences for four T. versicolor laccases, the single cellobiose dehydrogenase, and a lignin peroxidase isozyme, these genetic tools should be very useful in dissecting the mechanisms of white-rot delignification.</description><creator>DosSantos, Gary P.</creator><contributor>Archibald, Fred (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Trametes versicolor.</subject><subject>Lignin -- Biodegradation.</subject><subject>Wood-pulp -- Bleaching.</subject><title>Molecular genetic manipulations in the white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dz010r949.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1g05fd568</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0p096895v</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:48:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis we present an optimal linear time algorithm for validating the correctness of a map by an active agent (such as a person or a mobile robot). The robot is given a possibly incorrect map (model) of its environment. This model GM is given as an embedding of an undirected planar graph without edge crossings. The correct model GW of the environment, referred to as the underlying real world GW, is unknown to the robot. The underlying real world GW is an embedding of an arbitrary, not necessarily planar, graph. The robot begins at some arbitrary location in GM; this initial location is known to the robot. The robot must determine whether its map GM is consistent with the real world GW with respect to the given initial position. The robot is assumed to be able to autonomously traverse graph edges, recognize when it has reached a vertex, and locally order edges incident upon the current vertex. The robot cannot measure distances nor does it have a compass, but it is equipped with a single marker that it can leave at a vertex and sense its presence. In addition to the linear plane graph validation algorithm, we present an approach to solve the problem efficiently for some non-planar embeddings. Namely, if the given map GM is a non-planar embedding of a combinatorially planar graph, we can solve this problem with a similar approach such that the complexity remains linear.</description><creator>Dujmović, Vida.</creator><contributor>Whitesides, Sue (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Algorithmic aspects of planar map validation by a mobile agent</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ft848s29k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0p096895v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:736666358</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:48:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>With the advent of distributed systems, service availability and service composition opened the way to offer to the end-user new capabilities under negotiated QoS (Quality of Service) parameters. The notion of SLA (Service Level Agreements) emerged from the necessity of evaluating the satisfaction degree and the appropriate cost. However, most of the activities related to these concerns are manually done because of the lack of a precise definition of SLA. The present thesis presents the state of the art and proposes certain solutions to achieve a more formal view of SLAB. We first defined the nature of service parameters and various user-profiles, presenting current attempts to cope with these issues. Various marketed SLA tools and their weaknesses have been evaluated. As a result, we came with a combined solution where SLA parameters have been classified and a more precise definition of SLA. This solution can support negotiation considering that both user profiles and network parameters may change. As future work, using our proposal, we can notice the need for finer feedback mechanisms concerning network state change and appropriate QoS pricing mechanisms for SLA.</description><creator>Dini, Cosmin-Nicu.</creator><contributor>Ratzer, Gerald (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Hierarchical service level agreements in heterogeneous networks</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sf268694m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/736666358</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):38150</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
