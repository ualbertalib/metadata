Compounds such as amiloride are known to be competitive antagonists of Na+ binding and previous structural studies have demonstrated that these antagonists interact with amino acids located in transmembrane domains 4 and 9 (TM4 and TM9). Wt therefore wished to test the hypothesis that TM4 and TM9 are also part of the cation translocation pore. To this end, cysteine-scanning mutagenesis was used to analyze these regions of the protein. Using a functional cysteine-less NHE1 mutant as a template, cysteine residues were introduced at unique sites in TM4 (between amino acids 166-179), TM9 (342-359) and the putative re-entrant loop (R-loop) between TM9 and TM10 (370-437). These residues were modified using methanethiosulfonate (MTS) derivatives, thiolspecific modifying reagents that will covalently bind to freely accessible cysteine residues. MTS modification of an introduced cysteine residue that faces the aqueous pore should inhibit cation translocation. As expected, these reagents did not inhibit cation exchange through the cysteine-less form of NHE1. MTS-modification of single-cysteine mutants located within TM4 had little effect on cation translocation. By contrast, three mutants located in TM9, H353C, S355C, and G356C, all confer inhibition (45-99%) in the presence of MTSET, a positively-charged MTS derivative. Furthermore, mutant S405C, located in the R-loop/TMlO, is inhibited by almost 70% in the presence of MTSET. Comparable results were also obtained with the negatively-charged derivative MTSES, although the inhibition was less pronounced. With the exception of P171C, the kinetic profiles of selected mutants in the absence of the MTS reagents remained similar to that of the wild type and cysteine-less versions of the exchanger. Our results therefore indicate a role for TM9 and the adjacent R-loop/TMlO in cation translocation.</description><creator>Josephson, Colin</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Health Sciences - Physiology</subject><title>Determination of sites in the Na+H+ exchanger isoform 1 involved in cation translocation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tq57nt175.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k3569660c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physiology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p8418q375</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:27:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) use medications known to have cardiovascular effects. Yet, the burden of cardiovascular disease in COPD and the effect of corticosteroids used in its treatment have not been described. We used the Saskatchewan health services database to form a population-based cohort of 5648 patients treated for COPD and followed during 1990-99. Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality were higher in our cohort than in the general population (Standardized Rate Ratio=l .9 and 2.0 respectively). Ischemic heart disease (19.6 per 1000 person-years) was a more frequent cause of death than COPD itself (15.5 per 1000 person-years). In a nested case-control analysis, doses of oral corticosteroids larger than 5 mg of prednisone per day increased the risk of AMI (Rate Ratio=l .81 ; 95%CI 1.05 -3.13). However, a réduction of the risk of AMI was observed with doses of inhaled  corticosteroids ranging from 50 to 200 micrograms per day (Rate Ratio= 0.68; 95%CI 0.47 - 0.99). The burden of cardiovascular disease in COPD patients may be greater than that of the lung disease itself. The effects of corticosteroids on the cardiovascular system should be taken into account.</description><creator>Huiart, Laetitia</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Health Sciences - Epidemiology</subject><title>Corticosteroid use and the risk of acute myocardial infarction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tb09j762z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p8418q375</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mw22v770b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:27:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The accuracy of conventional dose calculation algorithms employed in external photonbeam treatment planning is limited by their inability to fully model the radiation source andaccount for the electron fluence perturbations which occur in regions of non-uniform density.In this work, we evaluated the dosimetric accuracy of the PEREGRINE Monte Carlo dosecalculation code for 6 MV photons.

In order to escalate the dose to the tumor and reduce the treatment margins, the tumor movement during treatment must be minimized. In our approach we have established a largely automated deep-breath-hold technique for treating lung cancer patients. We have used a Linear Position Transducer to monitor tumor movement through changes in the patient's abdominal cross-sectional area. The technique aims to reduce the amount of healthy lung tissue in high-dose regions. Normal tissue can be spared as a result of two distinct features of this method: deep inspiration, which reduces the lung density, and breath hold, which immobilizes the tumor. Due to reduced tumor motion, the Planning Target Volume margins can be tightened and a higher dose of radiation can be delivered to the tumor with the same risk of normal tissue complications.</description><creator>Denissova, Svetlana</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Physics - Radiation</subject><title>A gated breath-hold radiotherapy technique using a linear position transducer</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8336h3986.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dv13zw70j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g158bk38b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:27:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The principal objective of this study was to examine the effect of intense physical exercise on menstrual blood loss in women with Type I von Willebrand disease (vWD). First, we investigated the effect of exercise on the level of the von Willebrand protein (which is deficient in the disease) in a pre-test post-test quasi-experiment conducted on a single group of 40 healthy adult pre-menopausal female volunteers recruited from Sainte-Justine Hospital in Montreal between October and December, 2001. The von Willebrand protein (vWF:Ag), coagulation Factor VIII (FVIII:C), bleeding time (BT), coagulation time (aPTT) and several markers of exercise intensity (sweat sodium, lactate, noradrenaline, adrenaline) were measured before and after a standardized exercise session. The significance of the change in these values with exercise was assessed using a paired Student's t-test. The exercise markers were explored as potential predictors of the exercise-related change in vWF:Ag using multiple linear regression. Results showed that there was an absolute mean increase of 0.30 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.23-0.37) and 0.60 (95% CI 0.44-0.76) in vWF:Ag and FVIILC, respectively, and a significant shortening of the BT and aPTT due to exercise. The change in the sweat sodium collected from patches applied to the forearm during exercise (a marker of exercise intensity) was found to be a significant predictor of the change in vWF:Ag induced by exercise (regression coefficient = 0.05 (95% CI 0.01-0.09). Changes of 1, 5 and 10 units in sodium were associated with average changes of 0.05, 0.26 and 0.52, respectively, in vWF:Ag from baseline (mean 0.83 U/ml). Next, we set out to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a 4-period randomized crossover trial in order to evaluate the effectiveness of exercise in reducing the menstrual blood flow in women with Type I vWD. The methods and protocol of this feasibility study are outlined in this thesis and issues related to patient recruitment, compliance and withdrawals are addressed. The strengths and pitfalls of the crossover design feasibility study are discussed and revisions for the definitive trial are recommended.</description><creator>Winikoff, Rochelle</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Health Sciences - Epidemiology</subject><title>The effect of intense physical exercise on von Willebrand factor and on menstrual blood loss in women with von Willebrand Disease</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c821gn203.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g158bk38b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n870zs78d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:27:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Objectives: To identify the factors associated with cessation of injecting drug use in young street-based injecting drug users. Methods: Subjects were originally recruited from various street-based outreach programs and had to have reported injecting drugs within the prior 6 months at baseline or during follow-up, as well as having completed at least 2 follow-up questionnaires. Follow-up occurred from January 1995 to September 2000. Cessation of injecting drug use was defined as having reported no injection at 2 consecutive follow-up  questionnaires, averaging at least one year in total. Incidence rates of cessation were calculated and stratified by duration of injection. Adjusted hazard ratios were calculated in order to identify independent predictors of cessation. Results: A total of 305 subjects met the inclusion criteria. Of those, 119 (39%)  ceased injecting for approximately one year or more. The incidence of cessation was 32.6/100 person-years, but consistently declined as duration of time spent injecting increased. Independent predictors of IDU cessation were: having at least one parent born outside of Canada (HR=1.4; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.1-1.7);  injecting on a less than monthly or less than weekly basis on average within the last month (HR=6.6; 95% CI: 3.1-14.1 and HR=2.4; 95% CI: 1.1-5.5, respectively); injecting an average of two or fewer different types of drug within the last six months (HR=1.8; 95% CI: 0.9-3.5); and having been employed within the last six months (HR=1.7; 95% CI: 1.1-2.7). Independent predictors of not stopping injecting drugs were: homelessness within the last six months (HR=0.6; 95% CI: 0.4-1.0); and having attended a needle exchange program within the last six months (HR=0.5; 95% CI: 0.3-0.8). Conclusion: Cessation of injecting drug use among youth is considerably higher in the first years of injecting. Young IDUs with non-Canadian family backgrounds, as well as those who inject less frequently, inject fewer different types of drugs, and have a more stable lifestyle tend to be more likely to stop injecting drugs for a period of one year.</description><creator>Steensma, Colin</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Health Sciences, Epidemiology</subject><title>Predictors of cessation of injection drug use in a cohort of young, street-based injecting drug users</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zg64tp125.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n870zs78d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p2676x99p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:27:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>HES6 is a novel member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors that is involved in the activation of the myoblast differentiation program. Studies demonstrated that HES6 can regulate transcription from gene promoters containing an N box (CACNAG), a DNA motif located in the regulatory regions of many muscle-specific genes involved in myoblast differentiation. This suggested that a HES6 heterodimer could bind to the N box. The purpose of this study was to identify putative HES6 dimerization partners that would allow it's binding to the N box and then repress transcription. A genome-wide screen isolated several clones. Potential positive clones, the heat shock proteins HSP169 and HSP70 were identified. The functional significance of this interaction remains to be determined. A candidate gene approach allowed detection of an interaction in vivo between HES6 and a novel hairy-related bHLH protein, CHF2. This interaction was detected by co-immunoprecipitation using the first specific anti-HES6 antibody synthesized. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that the heterodimer was unable to bind to any of the N-boxes present in the 5'-flanking region of CHF2, which was confirmed by assessing the specificity of the controls used in the experiments. It was suggested that HES6 sequesters CHF2 by the formation of an inactive heterodimer. Although a band shift was observed when incubating each of the Nboxes in the presence of total cell extract from differentiated C2C12 cells, it was not confirmed whether HES6 was one of the proteins binding to the oligonucleotides. This work has identified a novel interaction between HES6 and CHF2 and our data suggests that this interaction lead to formation of inactive heterodimers.</description><creator>Naranjo, Sandra</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Health Sciences - Genetics</subject><title>Searching for HES6 dimerization partners</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kd17cw30g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p2676x99p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Human Genetics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mp48sf803</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:27:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Mechanosensitive channel gating has been suggested to occur via two models: the bilayer model, whereby forces generated within the lipid bilayer serve to gate the mechanosensitive channel, and the tethered model, whereby cytoskeletal tension plays a role in mechanosensitive channel gating. With respect to stretch-inactivated mechanosensitive channels in supraoptic neurons that are important in osmoreception, it is unclear which model prevails. To determine if the tethered model, and therefore the cytoskeleton, plays a role in mechanosensitive channel gating, neurons were subjected to drugs that function to depolymerize (Cytochalasin D; CytD) or stabilize (Jasplakinolide; Jasp) the actin cytoskeleton. A mechanosensitivity index was calculated in control, CytD and Jasp conditions by performing whole cell voltage clamp recordings on acutely isolated supraoptic neurons (magnocellular neurosecretory cells; MNCs) from adult Long Evans rats. Conductance and volume data revealed that cells treated in Cytochalasin D possessed a decreased mechanosensitivity compared to control, whereas cells treated with Jasplakinolide possessed an increased mechanosensitivity. The results provide evidence that actin is involved in mechanosensitive channel gating in supraoptic neurons and suggest that mechanosensitive gating occurs via the tethered model.</description><creator>Kindrat, Alexandra N.</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Biology - Neuroscience</subject><title>Role in actin in mechanosensitive channel gating in rat supraoptic neurons</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0z709005k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mp48sf803</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jm214r36r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:27:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The present study traces changes in linguistic complexity in the context of fluency development in four  preschool children treated with the Lidcombe Program for Early Stuttering Intervention.

The caspase family of cysteine proteases orchestrate the apoptosis program and are regulated by memebers of the Bcl-2 family.  Extensive studies in mammals have revealed that Bcl-2 proteins control caspase activiation by governing a key mitochondrial checkpoint, invovling the permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane and the release of proapoptotic factors from the intermembrane spce. Bcl-2 proteins are located at other intracellular membranes, including the endoplasmic reticulum, and emerging evidence suggests that this organelle also plays a key role in the initiation of poptosis.  Here, I identify BAP31, a Bcl-2 associated protein of the ER membrane, as a central regulator of diverse poptosis pathways. In response to signaling by the model oncogene, E1A, BAP31 and its cellular homolog and heterodimerizing partner, BAP29, were found to recruit and activate a novel procaspase-8L isoform at the surface of the ER by a BCL-2-inhibitable mechansim. Cells deficient in Bap31 and Bap29 resisted E1A-induced procaspase-8L activiation, downstream effector caspase activiation, and apoptosis, suggesting that the BAP/procaspase-8L complex plays a critical role in activating the apoptosis program following oncogenic stress. In addition to being a regulator of procaspase-8L, BAP31 was also found to be an important caspase-8 substrate. Caspase-8-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis and were strongly inhibited by the expression of a caspase-resistant BAP31 mutant that remained structurally intact during apoptosis. MOreover, the p20 caspase cleavage fragment of BAP31 was found to induce Ca^2+ transmission between the ER and mitochondria, which stimulated the onset of mitchondrial fission and ultimately sensitized this organelle to caspase-8-driven cytochrome c release. Thus, BAP31 appears to be a cell death integrator that couples oncogenic signals to procaspase-8L activiation, and triggers Ca^2+-dependent proapoptotic cross-talk bewteen the ER and mitochondria.</description><creator>Breckenridge, David G.</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry</subject><title>Regulation of apoptosis by the BAP31 complex at the endoplasmic reticulum</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3t945t109.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bc386m60q</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fx719p53w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:27:35Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Characterization of the phyenotypic, functional and proliferative properties of antigen-specific CD8 T cell subsets allowed us to delineate a differentiation pathway based on the expression of CD45 isotype and CC-chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7), and undergone by T cells following encounter with cognate antigen.

Although Smads are known to be downstream mediators of these signals, little is known about their role in kidney development. Using RT-PCR and in situ hybridization we investigated the expression of Smads during kidney development. We have found that the receptor regulated Smads (1, 2, 3, 5 and 8) as well as the common partner (Smad4), are expressed in the developing kidney during nephrogenesis. These factors have a specific expression pattern that overlaps with the expression of the signalling molecules BMP-4 and TGFpi. Expression of Smads 1, 3, 4, 5 and 8 is mainly found in undifferentiated mesenchymal cells of the nephrogenic zone as well as ureteric bud tips, but is downregulated in condensing mesenchymal structures. Smad 2 is mostly expressed in the stromal cell compartment. The distinct, yet overlapping, expression of Smads suggests that the specificity of TGFp signals might be determined in part by the combination of Smads expressed in a particular cell type. To better characterize the role of TGFP in kidney development, mouse embryonic kidney explants were treated with soluble TGFP ligands. Addition of BMP-2 and TGFpi inhibited renal branching morphogenesis through their effects on proliferation and survival. Similarly, proliferation and survival appeared to be the critical processes affected by TGFP signalling in the mIMCD-3 model of tubulogenesis. The direct role of Smads was examined by overexpression of a Smad3-GFP fusion protein in mIMCD-3 cells. Apoptosis was most frequently co-localized to Smad-3 transfected cells, which was consistent with the effects observed from the ligand, TGFpi. To test these observations in vivo, we developed a novel method for the manipulation of embryonic kidney explants in culture. GFP-expression vectors were introduced in kidney explants without loss in viability, and the expression of GFP was found to be rapid and sustained for several days in culture. In summary, this study has placed Smads downstream of TGFP signals in the developing kidney, and it opens the door to finding molecules that might be affected by these signals.</description><creator>Vrljicak, Pavle J.</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Biology, Genetics</subject><title>Role of Smads during renal branching morphogenesis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ft848s69j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4f16c490v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Human Genetics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qv33rz69p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:27:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A continuous flow of information has to be maintained between cells in order for them to elicit a concerted response to changes in their environment. For that purpose, the cells partly rely on polypeptide growth factors that interact with specific receptors at the cell surface. Among these growth factors, TGF-beta has been implicated in a great variety of cellular processes including growth inhibition, apoptosis, extracellular matrix production and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. TGF-beta signaling is mediated through ligand binding to the ectodomains (ED) of three types of receptors, T-beta-RI, T-beta-RII and T-beta-RIII. LAP, the remnant part of the TGF-beta precursor, is able to bind and neurtralize mature TGF-beta. Receptor or ligand overexpression has been correlated with several human disorders, including fibrotic desases. Further more, in the case of tumorigenesis, there is now accumulating evidence that TGF-beta promotes metastsis. </description><creator>De Crescenzo, Grégory</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry</subject><title>Mechanism of transforming growth factor-beta receptor action studied by biosensor analysis and artificial dimerization</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cc08hh78t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qv33rz69p</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xk81jn738</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:27:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Mathematics 436 is the advanced mathematics course offered to students in secondary IV in the province of Quebec.

To this end, the campaign incorporates several educational strategies, such as a poster campaign, that advocate the just and equal treatment of people living with HIV/AIDS. In an effort to develop an understanding of these educational efforts, this study deconstructs the 2002-2003 World AIDS Campaign posters. While the overall results suggest that the campaign has been successful in redefining the image of HIV/AIDS, it was also found that the posters may actually serve to reinforce stigma and discrimination.

The first half, chapters one through six, outlines American conceptions of the role of the school in relation to the state and to democracy. The second half is an account of critical progressive philosophies that have challenged the American status-quo since the independence. The main argument that I propose here is that the creation of an education system in America has followed the philosophies of federalism and private democracy. These philosophies are economically centered and define the citizen in economic terms. Progressive educators have long questioned this definition and seek to redefine citizenship to describe participatory democracy, and communication based on experience and an ethic of care.</description><creator>Novis, Joshua L.</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Civics -- Study and teaching -- United States.</subject><subject>Education -- Philosophy.</subject><subject>Education and state -- United States.</subject><title>Citizens and selves : rethinking education for democratic citizenship</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4f16c4914.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0p096939q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Integrated Studies in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gm80hx630</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:27:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis examined the effects of audio-taped feedback on ESL graduate student writing. Thirty-two students participated in the study over one semester. A triangulated approach to data collection was used by gathering and analyzing information from three principal sources: (a) students' written texts, (b) audio-taped feedback from the instructor, and (c) interviews with the participants. The research revealed that single and multiple feedback moves, in the form of models and prompts, were used by the instructor with similar frequency. Results also indicated that students benefited in all cases from audio-taped feedback. Overall, findings suggest that audio-taped feedback is very effective at helping students to produce an improved draft.

Findings are based on classroom interactions, student and teacher interviews, and student questionnaires intended to determine when students diverged from using the language of instruction and whether their age or language background affected their language use. In addition, teachers' impact on student language use is examined, and other factors affecting language use—such as the length of a students' stay in the United States—are discussed. An overall preference for English was found among first and third graders, while eighth graders spoke more Spanish to their peers and teachers. Findings indicate that this language behavior may have been more than a function of the students' age.

Indigenous English is a dialect of English spoken by many Aboriginal people in Canada; it is especially discernable in the Prairie Provinces, yet it is not widely recognized by the majority of the population. This classroom study was conducted in a semi-urban community in East Central Saskatchewan. The focus of the research was six children in a Grade 3 classroom, four of whom are First Nations and Indigenous English Speakers. The remaining two children are White and speakers of Standard English. The results of this study indicate that the First Nations children of this study speak a dialect of English that differs phonologically, morphologically, syntactically, and lexically from the Standard English spoken in Saskatchewan. These children are all below grade level in Language Arts and follow modified programs. They experience difficulty in phonics and spelling and are receiving additional support from classroom assistants, resource room teachers and speech pathologists. It would also appear that these children are experiencing institutional racism in a number of forms. Possible resolutions to the problems faced by these students may include teacher training and dialect awareness classes. This field has not been adequately explored and further research is needed to discover viable solutions to the issues experienced by dialect speakers of Indigenous English in the Standard English classroom.</description><creator>Sterzuk, Andrea</creator><date>2003</date><subject>English language -- Dialects -- Saskatchewan.</subject><subject>Indians of North America -- Education (Elementary) -- Saskatchewan</subject><subject>English language -- Study and teaching (Elementary) -- Saskatchewan.</subject><title>A study of indigenous English speakers in the standard English classroom</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zw12z757j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q811km95q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Second Language Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mg74qp31m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:27:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>c-Myc is a proto-oncogene that acts as a transcription factor, regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis through dimerization with Max. The Mad family of transcriptional repressors acts as c-Myc endogenous inhibitors by sequestrating Max. Mad/Max dimers bind to the same DNA consensus sequence (called the Myc E box) as cMyc/Max dimers, and cause transcriptional repression by bringing histone deacetylase to genes normally regulated by c-Myc/Max dimers. While screening a senescent cell cDNA library, a cDNA 90% homologous to the mouse Mad4 protein was isolated, and therefore was named human Mad4 (hMad4). It shows 48% and 52% amino acid homology to the previously described hMad1 and hMxi1 proteins, respectively. hMad4 is highly expressed in brain, lung, kidney and muscle as well as in confluent and senescent fibroblasts while nearly absent in replicating fibroblasts. Reminiscent of other Mad family members, hMad4 co-immunoprecipitates with Max and represses transcription of a reporter gene driven by E box sequences. Moreover, hMad4 represses cell growth and transformation of tumor cell lines. UV- and staurosporine-induced apoptosis of hMad4-infected cells is inhibited upstream of cytochrome c released from the mitochondria and downstream of mitochondrial cytochrome c release but upstream of caspase-3 activation, respectively. This effect is not caused by an increase in any of the lAPs tested. Overexpression of hMad4 in early passage WI38 fibroblasts completely abrogates cell growth, an effect dependent on its transcriptional repression activity. In hMad4 infected fibroblasts, growth-arrest is accompanied by the appearance of the acidic pgalactosidase marker, PAI-1 up-regulation, and an increase in Pml nuclear bodies. Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis demonstrate that, while following serum stimulation, hMad4 expression is decreased in young fibroblasts, levels are unchanged in senescent fibroblasts. However, c-Myc response is similar in both young and senescent fibroblasts, suggesting that hMad4 might interfere with c-Myc transcriptional activity in senescent fibroblasts. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that, while in young cells there is a switch from hMad4 to c-Myc when these cells are serum-stimulated, this switch might be selectively lost for some genes in senescent cells. To study the mechanism behind the difference of hMad4 induction in senescent cells, the full length hMad4 promoter was isolated and serial deletion mapped the minimal region to a fragment of 289 nucleotides upstream of the transcriptional start site, previously located by primer extension assay. Several transcription factors bind to the promoter region, including Spl and c-Myc. Addition of c-Myc inhibits promoter activity while Sp1 slightly increases expression. Mutation of the unique E-box sequence located 369 nucleotides from the transcriptional start site did not affect expression from the promoter, while mutation of a Sp1 site located 6 nt downstream of the transcription start site decreased basal activation by Sp1. These results demonstrate for the first time a cross-regulation between c-Myc and one of its inhibitors.</description><creator>Marcotte, Richard</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Medicine and Surgery</subject><title>Cloning and functional characterization of hMad4, an endogenous inhibitor of c-Myc, in apoptosis and replicative senescence</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r781wj24k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mg74qp31m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hd76s2386</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:27:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><creator>Keaton, Robert J.</creator><date>1969</date><subject>Nationalism -- Québec (Province)</subject><subject>Québec (Province) -- History -- Autonomy and independence movements</subject><title>Le Rassemblement pour l'Independance Nationale</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7h149r817.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hd76s2386</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mp48sf81c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:27:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Ce mémoire cherche à examiner des pratiques en art contemporain canadien qui ont pour but de questionner le concept du multiculturalisme en temps que « solution » allégée à la diversité culturale, raciale et ethnique dont est composée l’état-nation canadienne. En étudiant surtout les œuvres des artistes canadiens Jin-me Yoon, Kinga Araya et Ken Lum, j’explore la mythologie qui soutient les politiques pluralistes libérales au Canada. Cette dissertation problématize également la notion du nationalisme comme processus d’exclusion qui privilégie une norme anglo-canadienne de race blanche, compliquant davantage l’(im)migration. J’examine ainsi l’expérience psychologique de la non-appartenance, exprimée visuellement à l’instar de la pratique artis! tique. Finalement, en adressant le multiculturalisme et l’(im)migration de cette approche, je reconnaît la nécessité de penser de façons plus globales. Ma proposition est donc de repenser les notions du « chez-soi » et de la nation en mettant de l’emphase sur les thèmes de la mobilité et l’hybridité et non pas sur des définitions statiques et politiquement exclusivistes. fr</description><description>This thesis examines contemporary Canadian art practices, which aim to challenge the notion of multiculturalism as a purported 'solution' to the cultural, racial and ethnic diversity that comprises the nation. Specifically focusing on the work of Canadian artists, Jin-me Yoon, Kinga Araya and Ken Lum, I explore the mythology surrounding Canada's liberal pluralist politics and problematize the notion of nationalism as operating through a process of exclusion by privileging a white Anglo-Canadian norm. This system of exclusion complicates further the process of (im)migration, therefore, I explore the psychological and 'unhomely' experience of displacement as expressed visually through artistic practice. Furthermore, as a means of addressing multiculturalism and (im)migration, I acknowledge the need for more global modes of thinking, in proposing reconceptualizations of the notions home and nation that favour mobility, hybridity, and change over stable, static and pure definitions that sustain exclusionary politics.</description><creator>Pozniak, Jolene</creator><contributor>Charmaine Andrea Nelson (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2004</date><subject>Communication and the Arts -- Art History</subject><title>Beneath the multicultural mosaic: representing (im)migration displacement, and home in contemporary Canadian art</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s1784n90g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mp48sf81c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):2875</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
