Erythropoiesis takes place mainly in the bone marrow, and is presumed to occur in the following stages: stem blast cell- erythroblast - normoblast - reticulocyte - erythrocyte. The cells up to and including the normoblast stage have a well defined nucleus, whereas the reticulocyte contains only stainable granules believed to be ribonucleoprotein. The mammalian erythrocyte lacks bath the nucleus and stainable granules.</description><creator>Hemphill, Carol. A.</creator><contributor>MacLeod, R.

We intend here to investigate one aspect of their use. We will develop a theoretical description of the interaction of one positron with a sea of electrons. Then with the use of this model we will investigate the possible existence of a quasi-bound state of the positron. Most investigations into annihilation of positrons ignore the possibility of the formation of a quasi-bound state and it's effect on positron lifetime.

In bacteria, three types of RNA are now recognized, transfer (Berg and Ofengand, 1958), ribosomal (Schachman et al, 1952), and a so-called "messenger” or “rapidly labelled" RNA (Volkin and Astrachan, 1956). The “messenger” fraction is thought to control the specificity of proteins synthesized in bacterial cells (Nomura et al, 1960; Brenner et al, 1961; Gros et al, 1961a; Jacob and Monod, 1961), although direct proof for this claim has not yet been obtained.</description><creator>Hathaway, Audrey.

This altered rate of respiration, usually measured in terms of oxygen uptake, starts before symptoms of disease appear, rises gradually to a maximum as the disease develops, and declines rapidly as death is approached. These observations on abnormal rate of gas exchange indicate that the enzyme-catalysed processes resulting in oxygen absorption are accelerated in the host tissue as a result of infection. A natural question is then, what enzymes are involved in this acceleration. Among the great variety of enzymes that could possibly be involved, cytochrome oxidase can be regarded as an important one, as it functions as terminal oxidase in the phosphorylating electron transport system of the mitochondria.</description><creator>Harwig, Joost.</creator><contributor>Pelletier, R.

Profiles for summer shower situations commonly show an accumulation of precipitation aloft, at a height which is observed to increase with the available energy of convection. This observation has been combined with calculations by ether researchers to give a three-fold relation between mean updraught speed, height of accumulation and energy of convection. Profiles for continuous rain are quite distinct from those of showers, generally showing the greatest amount of precipitation at the base of the storm. Profiles form a useful digest of the radar data for the synoptic meteorologist.

Prehistoric man performed trepanation. Later, Hippocrates and Galen described cases with recovery after evacuation of clot which were probably subdural haematomas. As the science of medicine evolved over the centuries, investigators have argued about the etiology of this lesion. Up to now many questions have been answered. But in spite of modern knowledge of anatomy and physiology, the mechanism of chronic subdural haematoma remains obscure. This study was undertaken to add more basic knowledge to this essential question. Attempts were made to produce experimental subdural haematomas in animals. Radio-isotopes were used to trace the route of absorption of haematoma in animals and as a diagnostic aid in detecting lesions in human cases.</description><creator>Gueramy, Manoucher.</creator><contributor>Feindel, W.

The 20th century - and especially the post-war period. - has been a period of rapid expansion in all fields of urban growth and change. To accomodate the new growth (and in many instances to encourage new growth) various concepts and new methods of land organization have evolved to facilitate these pressures of rapid expansion. Among these are the shopping centre, the neighbourhood and community unit, the civic centre, the new plaza offices complex, segregated vehicular and pedestrian traffic, and among others the planned industrial estate.</description><creator>Graser, Otto.</creator><contributor>Spence-Sales, H.

They are so poorly known that they have neither been adequately mapped nor has their area been measured. However, the total area of savannas in the world may be almost 1 million square miles. In South America, they cover an area probably larger than any other type of vegetation on the continent. Savannas occupy over 20% of the area of Brazil, as much as 100,000 square miles in Venezuela, and not much less in Bolivia and Columbia (vide Shantz, 1954). Although savannas are larger in extent than the Tropical Rain Forests, they have attracted less attention. With the accelerating population increase in the world, savannas will become increasingly important for food production and settlement.</description><creator>Goodland, Robert.

Hale, the first scientific mammalian experimental teratologist, produced a litter of 11 eyeless pigs by feeding the mother a vitamin A deficient diet (1933). At the present time most teratologist, have progressed from merely producing malformations and enumerating them, to making use of the malformations for the study of their pathogenesis and the role played by the genetic background of the mother and embryo in the production of the malformation in question.</description><creator>Goldstein, Marc.

The efficiency and economy of these ten municipal filtration plants have been examined. Field surveys have been made and samples collected over a period of eleven weeks to accumulate data for interpretation. The quality of raw water and its fluctuation, particularly during the spring break-up of the rivers, is considered. The application efficiency and quantity of chemicals employed in water coagulation are investigated. The efficiency of water treatment prior to filtration is related to data of removals obtained.</description><creator>Goldman, Herbert. B.</creator><contributor>Pakalnins, A.

Galsworthy wrote his best novel, The Man of Property, in an uncharacteristically rebellous mood because of the circumstances of his courtship of Ada. As he grew older and more tolerant, as he and his wife were accepted into the society against which they had rebelled, and as his position in literature became firmly established, he looked at Soames with increasing insight and compassion.</description><creator>Gold, Lynn.

Si "la dérision, en général, fréquente les parvis des dieux", il n'en reste pas moins vrai que la mode de l'existentialisme "la dernière absurdité du siècle" allait jeter la confusion dans les esprits et réduire au bavardage une philosophie "dont tout le sens est de nous arracher au bavardage". En 1943, Simone de Beauvoir ne soupçonnait aucunement l’étrange fortune à venir de l'existentialisme.</description><creator>Gobeil, Madeleine.</creator><contributor>Lariviere, H.

Similar changes have been reported by other workers investigating both gram-positive and gram-negative chloramphenicol resistant organisms. The additional observation of a simultaneous increase in resistance to other antibiotics such as penicillin implies a possible non-specific mechanism contributing to resistance linked to the relative permeabilities of the cells. Work was therefore continued with a resistant strain of Salmonella typhimurium in an attempt to find out more about the mechanism of resistance.</description><creator>Gill, Peter.</creator><contributor>Stevenson, J.
