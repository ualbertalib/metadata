William Dawson who was principal of McGill University from 1855 to 1893. One of Canada's most distinguished geologists of the nineteenth, Principal Dawson pioneered paleobotanical investigations in North America. Much subsequent work, particularly in the coal fields of Eastern Canada, has been based on the discoveries of this famous scientist. Unfortunately, however, since the death of Sir William Dawson, no systematic restudy of this collection has been made.</description><creator>Lowther, John Stewart</creator><contributor>Clark, T.

The beneficial effect of some of these materials on vitamin C has been shown, but the results have been predominantly qualitative. This study, involving the administration of vitamin C to 128 guinea pigs, was designed to determine the extent to which rutin enhanced the apparent biological value of ascorbic acid. The odontoblast method of vitamin C bioassay was used. Rutin increased the apparent biological value of ascorbic acid by approximately 50%, when the vitamin was supplied in suboptimum amounts for normal tooth development, either in crystalline form or from a natural source. As the level of ascorbic acid intake, without rutin, approached optimum, the beneficial effect of added rutin was negligible. These results could be explained by the assumption that rutin prevented "in vivo" oxidative destruction of the administered ascorbic acid.</description><creator>Lloyd, Lewis E.</creator><contributor>Denstedt, O.

A general momentum equation is introduced which is adaptable to either constant area or constant pressure mixing and more generally to all cases of constant pressure gradient mixing. The author's experimental work substantiates this theory and shows that the losses for any one geometrical design are approximately a constant proportion of the relative dynamic head. The theory for the turbulent mixing of free jets is derived and applied to find the divergence angle for a jet into a parallel flow. In addition the length required for complete mixing is determined both analytically and experimentally, and the results agree favourably.</description><creator>Lane, Alan Geoffrey</creator><contributor>Mordell, D.

However, the world then only had three dimensions, and so the scalar part of the quaternion was suppressed, the resulting entity being called a vector. The relation between vector analysis and quaternion algebra is well known, and need not be entered into here. With the theory of relativity also came the fourth dimension. Although Minkowski himself rejected the quaternionic calculus as "too narrow and clumsy for the purpose in question", Silberstein has strongly advocated the cause of quaternions. He used quaternions with imaginary scalar parts to designate the position of points or events in space-time.</description><creator>Lambek, Joachim</creator><contributor>Zassenhaus, H.

In addition, a number of ingenious techniques have been developed for the direct observation of the peripheral circulation.

A two-fluid atomizing nozzle was used. The results obtained during the evaporation of water alone were compared with the drying of an actual solution under similar operating conditions. Results showed that capacity and efficiency passed through a sharp maximum at optimum values of the operating conditions and that the latter bed pronounced effects on the physical properties and particle size distribution of the dried materiel.

A method of measuring these characteristics is described and experimental results are presented which relate reflected power to the angle of incidence for screens employing either air or masonite as dielectria. A theoretical treatment is based on the transmission line analogy of plane wave radiation in free space and leads to the use of simple charts for computation of power reflection coefficients.</description><creator>Kassner, Max Herbert</creator><contributor>Chipman, R.

This disease results in an annual reduction in barley yield and is at least partially responsible for fluctuations in yield from year to year and for the restriction of the present barley growing area. The exact amount of loss, however, is difficult to estimate, and often is attributed to factors other than this disease. Machacek (1943) stated that the common root rot of cereals and grasses was widespread in Manitoba.</description><creator>Julien, Julien Bernard</creator><contributor>Ludwig, R.

A knowledge of these elementary reactions is therefore essential in the elucidation of the over-all reaction mechanism. Very often these elementary steps are reactions which involve free atoms or free radicals, entities which have only a transitory existence, but which nevertheless play an essential part in the course of the reaction.</description><creator>Jones, Robert Alexander</creator><contributor>Winkler, C.

The general economist may see it as a productive unit within a supply and demand frame of reference; the labor economist, as a collective bargaining unit within the frame of reference of a theory of wages; and the student of business administration may see it in terms of an organizational chart. Each of these points of view may be a legitimate way of regarding the phenomenon but each is incomplete - important elements may be neglected.</description><creator>Jones, Frank E.</creator><contributor>Hall, O.

Any inherent study of this kind must be carried through at least a three year period, to allow for the necessary reciprocal crosses within the progeny of the initial mating to bring forth Inherent differences existent within the parental types. The results which are presented in this thesis are therefore representative of the FI generation, but cannot be considered definite until future generations are studied.</description><creator>Johnston, William Wallace</creator><contributor>Boyes, J.

Without a great deal of imagination these swarming animals may appear not unlike a highly viscous liquid, each individual insect playing the role of an individual molecule. For instance, a large number of brown flour beetles has the peculiar appearance of slowly spreading brown molasses at room temperature, and, at a slightly higher temperature, that of thick lubricating oil. Further, the mass may be poured through a funnel and their volume measured with a graduated cylinder. These are the most obvious of their fluid characteristics.</description><creator>Jacoby, Arthur William</creator><contributor>Denstedt, O.

To the best of this writer’s knowledge, there has been no recent text devoted to a thorough examination of the subject and only sporadic interest has been shown by researchers. Sigmund Freud, the father of modern psychiatry, began his learned observations by analyzing the mental health of adults. He soon arrived at the conclusion that the onset of mental illness can usually be traced to the period of post natal development and followed through to adulthood.</description><creator>Jackson, Thomas D.</creator><contributor>Waddington, M.

One, stemming from Carlyle, conceived leadership to be one or more traits in the person of the leader. The other, formulated in its most extreme form by Marx, maintained that leaders exist only insofar as they satisfy the needs and purposes of followers; they are the creation of the led. It is this dichotomy which has been breaking down in recent discussions.</description><creator>Jackson, Jay M.</creator><contributor>Webster, E.
