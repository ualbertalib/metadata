One of the last wilderness areas of North America, this peninsula has undergone intense mineral exploration and development since World War II. So spectacular has been the industrial expansion in Labrador-Ungava, that native populations and their food gathering economies have been over-shadowed. Despite the steady northward movement of the frontier in the interior of Labrador-Ungava, other portions of the peninsula have been abandoned and returned to wilderness. In this thesis, I have chosen to examine the northeastern coast of the Labrador-Ungava peninsula. This area has been little affected by the mineral developments in the interior.

Starting in the early 1800's as the study of the "personal equation" in astronomy, it became known as "mental chronometry" in psychological laboratories of the late 19th Century (Boring, 1950). The time elapsing between the presentation of a predetermined signal and the occurrence of a predetermined response served as a measure of reaction speed. This measure, reaction time or response latency, was studied in relation to several variables (e.g., preparation, attention, signal modality) by the early investigators.

This replacement cannot be explained as a precursor effect (Boll, 1954a; Nillernot, 1962). An alternative explanation of the replacement was made by Boll (1954a, 1959a). The explanation involved negative feedback control, by ethanolamine, of a postulated serine decarboxylase yielding ethanolamine, and requiring pyridoxal phosphate as coenzyme. In this way, ethanolsmine would exert a sparing action on the limited amount of vitamin B6 which, as shown by Boll (1954a), is synthesized by the roots.

An early investigator claimed that the reaction between the metal and its ions was reversible disproportionation. The equation Cd ⁺⁺ Cd⁰ = 2 Cd⁺ was proposed. The reaction was investigated mainly in sulphate solutions, although chloride solutions were also used. The effect of conditions, such as temperature, concentration, metallic surfaces, surface area, atmosphere and motion of the solution, was examined. During the investigation, etching, cracks, pits, tree growth, dendrites, and the deposition of cadmium around gas bubbles were observed. The results and the observed phenomena were considered in the light of known disproportionation and corrosive mechanisms. From these considerations, it appeared that corrosion explained the observations. [...]</description><creator>Whiting, Lawrence Vernon.</creator><contributor>Holcomb, R.

Their names are, however, encountered fairly often in the serious literature devoted to politics.

The distributions of amount with rate for both winter and summer rain are log-normal; they have logarithmic means of 2.5 mm hr⁻¹ and 12.6 mm hr⁻¹ respectively and logarithmic standard deviations of 0.4 and 0.7 respectively. A comparison of the distributions of amount with rate for winter rain and for snow shows that the two distributions are similar in form.

Photography of a cathode ray tube inevitably provides some averaging by integration on film, over the area of the writing spot. Further areal integration has been achieved by rectangular scanning of fast-processed film at a rate of a few lines per second with a spot of diameter one-half mile. The effective area of integration by first writing and then reading the pattern is one square mile. The areally-averaged signals are subsequently stepped into seven levels, a factor 10 apart in received power, and displayed on a stepped grey scale on facaimile paper. This presentation is well suited for a visual quantitative estimate of echo intensity. [...]</description><creator>Wein, Marceli.</creator><contributor>Marshall, J.

Similarly, the "traditional" notion that there is a one to one relation between tissue damage (or any other specifiable stimulus) and pain response has been vigorously opposed (Livingston, 1943, 1953; Beecher, 1959 Melzack, 1961; Melzack &amp; Wall, 1962). However, the concept of a physically describable, and thus measurable, pain producing stimulus plays an essential role in the study of pain perception. The fact that some stimuli which often produce pain do, under specifiable conditions, fail to produce pain permits the study of conditions which alter the effectiveness of pain stimuli.

The genus is typically Palaearctic, with many Old World species, and is represented in the Nearctic Region by what has, in more recent times, been listed as a single species. Hebard (1936) synonymized all specifie names which had been applied within this genus in North America, under the name of an European species. Subsequently this name was shown to be a nomen dubium, as the original description would not differentiate between two well known European species to which it could almost equally well be applied (see p.22 ).

More specifically, a cataract is regarded as a loss of transparency of the lens, or an opacification occurring at any place in the lens or its capsule. Since the lens is an intricate physico-chemical system, changes in the physical and chemical state of the lens proteins which result in loss or transparency or opacification may be brought about by many agents: interference with the normal metabolic processes, alteration in hydrogen ion concentration, disturbance of osmotic equilibrium, and the harmful action of heat, light, and radiation. As a result, cataract presents many complexities with respect to clinical manifestations. [...]</description><creator>Verrusio, A. Carl.</creator><contributor>Fraser, F.

A specially constructed apparatus facilitated experiments with accurately controlled cooling-rates and constant temperatures. Samples of once-distilled tap-water and melted snow and hail were investigated in the form of 0.01 cc drops. The mean freezing temperatures of these samples are -20, -16 and -12 C respectively. For distilled water and for snow the mean temperature is lowered by 0.2 C for a twofold increase in the cooling-rate, for cooling rates in the range 0.5 to 4 (possibly to 10) degrees per minute. At constant temperatures only a fraction of the drops is nucleated even after 15 minutes, the number of events per interval of time decreasing rapidly to a negligible level within 8-10 minutes.

To a considerable extent, therefore, the discussion of carbohydrates resolves itself into a consideration of the metabolism of glucose and its closely related derivatives. Glucose contributes a major part to the total energy production in most animal tissues. Several metabolic pathways are open to glucose: (a) conversion of glucose to glycogen for storage (b) utilization of glucose for energy production (c) utilization of glucose for the synthesis of other compounds, such as fatty acids and certain amino acids.

However, a number of other engagements, equally important, took place. One of the most prominent and fascinating of these engagements was the Dardanelles Campaign. Beginning in February 1915, the campaign lasted until the evacuation of the Cape Halles positions in January 1916. It originated as an attempt by the political leadership in London to seek a victory which would ease the Imperial situation, strengthen allied diplomacy with the neutrals, boost morale and achieve a victory without the expansive methods being advocated by the 'Westerners' in northern France.

Scientif articles dealt with its toxic properties when used in preservatives and pesticides, and with the ill-effects of extremely high concentrations of fluoride in drinking water and in industrial processing. About 1942 the beneficial effects of optimum concentrations of fluorine became apparent. It was found that certain communities had water supplies which contained fluorine at a level which tended to reduce dental caries. As a public health procedure other communities began to fluorinate their water to a level which was cansidered optimum for the reduction of dental caries. This level was generally found to be one part per million of fluorine. [...]</description><creator>Triandafillou, Joan Margaret.</creator><contributor>Lloyd, L. E.

The ground state of a nucleus zXan is then constructed by consecutively filling the lowest available levels of the potential well with Z protons and N neutrons in a manner consistent with the Pauli principle. Mayer and Jensen demonstrated that a considerable body of data could be understood in terms of this model if one included in the potential a spinorbit term. For example the magic numbers and the ground state spins and parities of most odd-even nuclei could be explained in this fashion. [...]</description><creator>Tomusiak, E. L.

However, lying as it does at the junction of the Appalachian ridges to the south and the St. Lawrence Lowlands to the north, one might expect it to be interesting from two points of view: firstly in having morphological features common to both areas and secondly in offering the possibility of a comparison between their sequences of development. In recent years the attention has been focussed on two particular topics which reflect increasing awareness of the significance of the area as a field of geomorphological research: the development of pre-glacial topography (Sangree, 1953; Bird, 1961) and studies of glacial geomorphology (Dresser and Denis, 1944; Sangree, 1953; Cooke, 1957).

Recently Lambert and Jakobovits (1960), in attempting to develop a more objective measure of the change, devised a procedure based on the Semantic Differential Scales of Osgood, Suci, and Tannenbaum (1957).
