Haphazard land settlement of the past has led to many subsequent problems for the countries in which the frontier has appeared.

The equivalent ls not true in the ease of molecular spectra, for our knowledge of the effect of an external electric field upon a radiating molecule is at best only very meagre. This state of affairs is due largely to the fact that many atomic spectra exhibit large Stark displacementa in electric fields of the magnitude easily obtained in experiment, whereas most of the attempts to detect similar effects in band spectra have yielded negative results.

They weave the never ending pattern of history. Occasionally among these men, comes one who gathers up the threads into a striking design that ever after becomes an integral part of the central theme. It is my purpose to show that Milton was one of these men. There exists today a group of historical and political pragmatists who believe that the only law is the law of expediency. We cannot teach either political maxims or moral laws. they say, for we live ina constantly changing social reality which will make the laws of today useless slogans for the future.

In applying the method in this laboratory, it was found that low results were frequently obtained on compounds of known structure.

So closely has their development been linked with thatof the nation that the history of the railways has almost been the history of Canada. It was the railways that opened up the West, and it was the railways that brought the Maritime Provinces and British Columbia into Confederation and forged one country out of several scattered settlements. But it is the present, not the past, that counts in the final analysis. It is the position the railway industry holds in the transportation system of the country that is the strongest reason for attaching importance to its activities.

The object of the present account is, therefore, to give some description of just what Great Britain received when Canada was ceded to her in 1763. The most outstanding characteristics of economic activity in French Canada were inertness and government paternalism, the former usually being attributed to the latter. An attempt has been made to correct this impression to some degree and to arrive at a balance of the various factors which conditioned the economic life of Canada.

It has however, amply justified its existence by throwing light on two of the major problems of chemistry. Suoh problems for example as: the mechanism of reactions and the nature of chemical change, and to some extent the much discussed and investigated question of affinity, the latter prior to the last decade having been studied largely by investigations of systems in their initial and final states, with little or no oonsideration of the path by whichthey reached such states. In addition, much of what we now know concerning the mechanism and use of catalysts, from both the theoretical and practical aspects, is due to investigations carried out in the field of reaction velocities, and to mention only one more instance, our knowledge of the nature of surfaces and their very oonsiderableimportance in promoting chemical reaction.

For this purpose the velocity of reaction between propylene and hydrogen chloride, in the liquid state, was measured over a considerable temperature range. The influence of heterogenous surface and of hydride concentration were determined and the reaction between propylene and hydrogen bromide in various solvents investigated. A review is given below of the previous work in this field. In this connection it will be shown that the investigation has an objective of more far reaching importance than just the elucidation of the mechanism of the particular reaction examined and that the experiments have an essential bearing on the validity of the discontinuity in reaction velocity at the critical temperature, which was discovered in this laboratory.
