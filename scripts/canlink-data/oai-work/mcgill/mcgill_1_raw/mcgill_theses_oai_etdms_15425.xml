Aside from their intrinsic worth as experimental contributions, there are two additional reasons why these pioneering studies are of importance. On the one hand it is interesting to note that the technical developments took place in the heyday of post-Watsonian behaviourism, at a time when Guthrie (1930; 1935) and Hull (1934; 1943) were developing stimulus-response theoretical accounts of the learning process.</description><creator>Ehrlich, Daniel.

Preserved relies of prehistoric times reveal wide geographic and zoologic distribution of malignancy. Dinosaurs of the Mesozoic period are said to have shown signs of cancer, and other evidence of its antiquity (Sambon cited by Haddow) (68) are to be found in the treasures of the pyramids, from the Etruscan tombs, from Peruvian mummies and from the cuneiform tablets of the library of Nineveh. The earliest medical record known to man (94) is the "Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus". This anonymous relic of antiquity is generally regarded by historians as having been originally written in the Egyptian Pyramid Age in the Old Kingdom (3000- 2500 B.C .), although speculation by Breasted and Cooper (16) suggest that this document may form part of the teachings of the oldest known physician, Imhotep, the 'patriach and sage of primitive medicine' (94) who lived in the thirteenth century B.C.</description><creator>Edwards, Alan.

It is generally recognised that although a very wide range of theory has been propounded to explain the nature and origin of savannas, no one has yet brought forward a single convincing viewpoint which has met with universal acceptance. One reason for this is that the majority of theories extant are based upon inadequate field data with almost a total lack of experimental evidence. The McGill University Savanna Research Project was set up for the purpose of initiating an experimental and observational field programme which it was hoped would shed light upon the ecological relations of the savanna, and would ultimately enable an explanation to be made of the nature and distribution of the savanna vegetation of the region.</description><creator>Eden, Michael.

The jumps were found to be of two basic types, one followed by a pressure dome and associated with severe weather, and the other showing as a step on the barograph traces and not associated with weather. The pressure domes were found to be closely associated with precipitation, some starting with, some developing towards and others intensifying with the radar echoes. In a preliminary study, it was shown how valuable information about pressure phenomena can be obtained from data (wind, pressure, precipitation) collected at one single station, rather than throughout a network.</description><creator>East, Conrad.</creator><contributor>Douglas, R.

Nevertheless, instances have been recorded of tissue which can grow for a time, especially when excised from the plant, without showing an increase in dry weight. In the event that polymer synthesis still takes place, there must be simultaneous breakdown or interconversion of components. Direct evidence has been obtained recently with one young tissue or another for the metabolic turnover of protein (Heyes, 1959; Hellebust and Bidwell, 1964), nucleic acid (Woodstock and Skoog, 1960; Heyes, 1960), and wall polysaccharide (Margerie and Peaud Lenoel, 1961; Maclachlan and Young, 1962).

Ideologists, theorists, and idealists on the one hand, and die-hard practical realists on the other, conducted a tug-o-war with the latter inevitably coming out of the conflict victorious. Not even in a country as totally dedicated to a dogma as the Soviet Union is to Marxism (at least on the surface) can education ignore realities, and develop as though in a vacuum. Like anywhere else, education in Russia was shaped primarily not by the dreams of a few visionaries but by the naked truth of economic conditions and social or even military pressures.</description><creator>Dorotich, Daniel.</creator><contributor>Mladenovic, M.

They commence as a ventral groove in the pharynx, which becomes roofed over to form the laryngeotracheal tube, lined by entoderm (49). The distal end of this tube grows downwards and forwards and divides into the two lung buds. These lung buds grow into dense mesenchymal tissue which forms the pleural coverings and part of the lung parenchyma. The tubular system develops by branching and re-branching to form a system of tubes in parallel, which averages about 23 generations in the human (131). The structure of the lungs is conventionally divided into the conducting and the respiratory parts. In many ways this is misleading, as there is an intimate anatomical connection which this physiological distinction tends to disguise.</description><creator>Don, Hillary.

In most instances a great many analyses are required to represent this distribution accurately. The cost, in terms of expenditure and time, of ordinary analytical procedures limits the number of samples that can be collected and processed. This often results in an inadequate or even erroneous concept of the distribution of an element.

Architectural acoustics, in both the fields of scientific research and practical application, has progressed further in the past few decades than during all preceding time, and consequently the amount of pertinent literature has reached an unprecedented high.

Spectra were plotted for the d-c magnetic field rotated in the {100} and {011} planes and twelve resonance lines were observed. By considering a model of twelve magnetic complexes, three different g-factors have been determined, 1.895 +/- .002, 1.715 +/- .002 and 1.767 +/- .002, which result from a crystal electric field of orthorhombic symmetry. Through the application of group theory and quantum mechanical perturbation methods, crystal field energy levels have been calculated to be 1050 cm.-1, 1320 cm.-1 and 20,300 cm.-1 above the ground state, with the last value fitting the result of an optical spectroscopic experiment with Ti3+ in a similar environment. Spin-lattice relaxation measurements were made between 4. 2 Â°K and 1.6 Â°K and the relaxation time T1 was found to vary from 3. 3 msec. to 63 msec. over this temperature range. From the nature of the temperature dependence, it is evident that the Raman process is dominant at 4.2Â°K, as theoretical calculations have predicted. The concentration of titanium substituted for aluminum in the crystals studied has been estimated to be 0.02 per cent.</description><creator>Dionne, Gerald. F.</creator><contributor>Woonton, G.

This study, based mainly on a systematic analysis of periodicals, examines in detail and as objectively as possible the different arguments presented by the participants. After outlining the development of the two opposing parties, it describes their confrontation in 1918-1920 and the subsequent diversification that ends the quarrel in the thirties. This conflict can be divided into four distinct periods, beginning with the reaction of critics like Camille Roy and Louis Dantin to Emile Nelligan's poetry in 1904 and going up to the "canadianisme integral" of 1930. The argument concerned much more than literature, having important ideological implications related to French-Canadian nationalism at the beginning of the twentieth century. It is in this relationship between literature and French Canadian society that the specific nature of this debate can be found.</description><creator>Hayward, Annette. </creator><date>1980</date><subject>French-Canadian literature 20th century History and criticism. </subject><subject>French-Canadian literature QuÃ©bec (Province) History and criticism. </subject><title>Le conflit entre les rÃ©gionalistes et les "exotiques" au QuÃ©bec, 1900-1920.</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x059cb90t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rx913t37t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of French</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cr56n463m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:48:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The production of horticultural crops, although it accounts for only 6.8 per cent of the total agricultural revenue of Quebec, is one of the most dynamic sections of the agricultural industry in this Province (39). The total area in vegetables grown for commercial purposes was estimated at 70,360 acres in 1962, compared to 66,690 in 1961 and 63,660 acres in 1960. Estimates of the farm value of production were 13.7 million dollars for 1962, compared with 13.2 million in 1961 and 12.6 million in 1960. Potatoes, as field crops, are grown on 90,200 acres in Quebec (29.1 per cent of the total acreage for potatoes in Canada), with an annual production of 8,833,000 bushels. Strawberries, as small fruit crops, were cultivated on 2,840 acres in 1962, with a production of 6,490,000 lbs.

The distribution of severe storms in the central and eastern United States during that period is examined and related to the patterns of vertical motion. The mean profile of large-scale vertical motion near early-morning storms is compared with that near late afternoon storms; the two profiles are found to be quite different. The morning storms correlate highly with the patterns of upward motion; the afternoon storms do not, presumably because other factors such as local heating are of comparable importance.</description><creator>Derome, Jacques.

Municipal, provincial and federal agencies, large private corporations and welfare organizations have, on occasion, prepared reports and submissions investigating various and sundry aspects of the housing situation in the Montreal area. In addition, several generalized studies have been prepared, mainly under governmental instigation (see references in this study). However, a complete picture of the many aspects of this field has not yet been formed. The intention of this thesis is an evaluation and critical presentation of the overall picture rather than another fragmented analysis of one or two aspects.</description><creator>Dernoi, Louis.

Each section of the double instrument has a maximum transmission in excess of 1.5% of 4Ï€ stereradians and a beat resolving power of about 1/R = 1%. The spectrometer is well suited to operation in the external beam of the McGill Synchrocyclotron. Several experiments have been performed using this spectrometer. In particular, the discovery of the 13 minute radioisotope Nb88 is reported and a 70 minute isomeric transition in Nb89 has been observed.</description><creator>DeMille, George.

The first part of what is known as Herbrand's Theorem states that, given an integer p such that R(p,F) is valid, then we can find a proof of F. In this work, we describe an effective procedure to generate such a proof of F in a Gentzen's type formulation. In fact, we describe an effective procedure to generate what is called a pseudo-proof of F but we show afterwards that this pseudo-proof is a proof. This effective procedure terminates and thus it generates from F, through intermediate formulas, some â€œultimate" formulas. We show that these formulas are axioms and, from the way the pseudo-proof is defined, the intermediate formulas and finally F follow from them by rules of inference. The procedure generating a pseudo-proof of F is then an effective procedure generating a proof of F.</description><creator>DeCelles, Pierre.</creator><contributor>Denton, J.

The temperature of recrystallization and grain growth ascribed to the hexagonal ~ cubic inversion, at sulphur vapour pressures much less than one atmosphere, was determined at 465 +/- 5Â°C with annealing time of 2 1/2 hours. In experiments involving differentiai pressures of 8,000 p.s.i., chalcocite in the solid state becomes considerably more mobile above 563 +/- 10Â°C and can readily be injected as a plastic mass to form veins without preservation of deformational textures.

These defects are often biologically important and, in spite of the difficulties involved in their analysis, deserve more intensive study. The studies which have been done, such as those of Wright (1934a, 1934b), Reed (1936), Gruneberg (1952), Lerner (1954), and Landauer (1957), attempt to explain the apparently non-Mendelian behaviour of the trait in question by invoking either reduced penetrance or multigenic inheritance, or both.</description><creator>Davidson, Jefferson.
