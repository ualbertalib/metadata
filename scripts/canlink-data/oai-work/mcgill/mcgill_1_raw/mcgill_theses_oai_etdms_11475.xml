Furthermore, our knowledge of the biochemistry of lysine has been impeded by the lack of reliable methods of analysis. For instance, nutritional studies would be greatly facilitated by the elaboration of a sensitive micromethod for the rapid determination of lysine in crude plant and animal tissues and in biological fluids. Available methods for the determination of lysine may be classified into three groups, (a) isolation procedures, (b) nitrogen distribution methods and (c) biological assays. In the following historical review of the development of these analytical procedures, it will be necessary to refer in detail to the determination of arginine and histidine since the methods for estimating these basic amino acids are so intimately connected one with the other.</description><creator>Nelson, John Archibald.</creator><contributor>McFarlane, W.

The yellow colouring matter of Penicillium citrinum exerts considerable antibacterial activity against Gram-positive organisms in vitro. However, it is not active in vivo. The purpose of this investigation was to produce derivatives of citrinin that would not be inactivated in vivo. It was also hoped that some information concerning the mode of action of antibacterial substances might be obtained. New antibiotics are being constantly isolated from natural sources. Several metabolism solutions from new organisms were investigated and the active principles characterised.</description><creator>Pringle, Ross Barton.</creator><contributor>McFarlane, W.

In certain other and considerable respects, however, such a study can contribute valuable material to the work done so far. While no last word can be said, a more vivid impression of the times in which the author wrote can be offered by a contemporary rather than by a historical outlook. This thesis will consider the work of Ernest Hemingway in relation to the school of American novelists who are known as “Naturalists”. It is not my intention in this work to include all of Mr. Hemingway’s writings. His Journalism includes his reports on the diplomatic manoeuvres in Europe at the close of the last war; his personal thoughts on fishing, hunting, men’s clothes and recreations, revolution in Cuba, and now first-hand accounts of war in Spain and Great Britain and France. It is an interesting but little known fact that Hemingway had several poems published in the earliest days of his career as a writer. These will not be taken into consideration here. The aim of this study is to consider Hemingway as a leading American Naturalist and to demonstrate his ability to transcend the position of a stack artist.

Yet experimental evidence conclusively proves that this crop does vary in composition, quality and yield. The evidence is fairly convincing that there are inherent differences in yield, composition and quality ratings among varieties, as well as variations due to climatic factors, date of planting, and maturity; and while there is some ground for the belief that these variations in potato may be related to soil fertility or to certain fertilizers, the fundamental causes underlying the wide variations that have been encountered within a variety still await adequate explanation. In spite of a considerable amount of work on the mineral requirements of the potato, we still lack exact knowledge of the function and physiological effects of the major nutrient elements. [...] In view of these facts it would seem logical to carry out research work to see if any relationship could be found between fertilizer levels, yield, specific gravity, and quality of boiled tubers. The following experiment was undertaken to study the relation of yield, specific gravity and quality to the variety and the nutrient levels.

Since oats are commonly self-fertilized plants, they tend with time and cultivation to produce “pure lines”. However, “pure line” plants do not always breed true and occasionally produce “off-types” of aberrant individuals, differing from the parent plant in one or more characteristics. The “false wild oat” or “fatuoid” differs from the normal cultivated oat from which it arose mainly in the possession of a stronger awn, stronger pubescence at the base of the grain, and a horse-shoe-shaped articulation or “sucker-mouth”. These characters make up the so-called fatuoid complex. The fatuoid complex has been the mutation which has received a great deal of attention from research workers, and is the characteristic or complex dealt with in this paper. Most of the work has been of a cytological or genetic nature but comparatively little, if any, has been done on a direct developmental comparison between “wild type” and normal florets to determine “when” and “how” the differentiation between the two takes place. It is the purpose of this paper to make an attempt in the answering of these pertinent questions. [...] Of more concern are the cytological and genetic theories now held in respect to the causes and inheritance of the fatuoid complex.</description><creator>Galinsky, Irving.</creator><contributor>Stephens, S.

To this end a plate technique was developed for rapidly assessing the value of natural crude media as potential sources for penicillin production. With this technique and later by actual deep culture of the mold it was found that any crude wheat extract such as starch washings or a by-product of the fermentation industries, namely distillers’ solubles, was as good as corn-steep liquor for the production of penicillin by submerged culture. Succeeding this development, attention was focussed on a complete study of the basic nutritive requirements of the mold, and on the determination of the chemical factors common to these grain substances [...] The mold was cultured on Czapek-Dox-Lactose media into which had been incorporated either fractionated products of the grain extracts or only pure chemicals. Some of these factors have been elucidated, and they were found to be common to both wheat and corn media. On the basis of the results obtained, a purely synthetic medium consisting of two amino acids, namely, proline and glutamic acid and supplemented with Czapek-Dox salts and lactose has been prepared which will produce a yield of 35 Oxford units of penicillin per cc.</description><creator>Halpern, Ephraim Philip.</creator><contributor>McFarlane, W.

Present processes are somewhat expensive, time consuming, and entail several difficulties. Furthermore, the residual oil, after vitamin A extraction, is changed chemically and generally has no industrial value. On the other hand, certain industries use large amounts of fish oils for purposes in which the vitamin A content is of no concern, so that potential sources of vitamin A are lost in industrial processing. It would be advantageous if the prior extraction of vitamin A could be carried out economically. The need, therefore, arises for a cheap and simple method of extracting vitamin A without altering the chemical nature of the residual oil. Vitamin A is readily adsorbed chromatographically when in the alcohol form, but not in the natural occurring ester form. (10). However, converting the vitamin ester to the alcohol through saponification, alters the chemical nature of the oil and so, an attempt was made to effect a selective hydrolysis of the vitamin A ester ‘in situ’, without changing the oil. The possibility of adsorbing vitamin A on different adsorbents and under varying conditions was also investigated. The present trend in the fortification of natural food products with vitamins (11) would also be facilitated by the solution of those two problems.</description><creator>Leduc, Réal.</creator><contributor>McFarlane, W.

Both are quite old, dating respectively from 1608 and 1620.  Both were founded at about the same time through for obviously different reasons.  Both represent the earliest movements of population westward from Europe to North America, precursors of the vast migrations which were to follow in the years afterward.  Both represent organized settlements of people, each in its own way, fairly homogeneous in outlook; hardy stock; pioneers. There are some outstanding differences between these two settlements.  The newcomers to French Canada were French Roman Catholics, peasant farmers, while those who came to New England were middle class English Protestants, Puritans, preceded by a small band of Separatists or Pilgrims who were farmers, artisans, and laborers.  France under the influence of the Church saw to it that priests were sent out with colonizing expeditions.  United Catholicism could be seen from the beginning in New France.  It was planned that way.  No story of New France could fail to bring out the importance of the priests and missionaries in those early years of struggle.  The peasants looked to the heroic leadership of their cures.  The Separatists and Puritans left England to come to a community where they might worship as they wished.  Initiative and independence in worship marked the beginning of the New England colonies. [...]</description><creator>Bolger, Josephine Augusta.</creator><contributor>Currie, A.

This last compound is unstable and decomposes at about -25°C. into imidophosphoamide, P NH NH2. This compound is also unstable and decomposes around 0°c. into phosphotriimide, P2 (NH)3, which is much more stable. No compound, which could be easily decomposed into the initial reacting gases, was obtained. This reaction is similar to the reactions obtained with ammonia and any of the other three phosphorus trihalides; the same phosphorus compounds are formed with the corresponding ammonium halide (7, 8, 12). The reaction appears to be possible through the formation of the phosphotriamide which is stable only at low temperatures. Part II: [...] In this two phases, two components system, the composition of the liquid phase was necessary in order to calculate its density but, as this composition could not be measured, it was calculated by making different assumptions. It was first assumed that a state of equilibrium between the phases had been reached when readings were taken. It was also assumed, as no temperature-pressure-composition data were available, that the system could be considered as “ideal”. These suppositions were inexact; in a general way the calculated densities were found to be too large.</description><creator>Brais, Roger.</creator><contributor>Maass, O.

A study was made of the conditions affecting the yield of RDX from the reaction, and a new method of conducting it found which enabled the reaction to be controlled When run in large batches, and which increased the yield to 50%. No means of purification was found yielding a product melting above 200° (British Specifications) without involving a large loss of material. From a study of the consumption of reactants and thermal phenomena of the reaction, a mechanism is advanced tor the McGill Process. This mechanism predicts the formation of many as yet unisolated by-products.</description><creator>Edward, John T.</creator><contributor>Boyer, R.

Such ethanes are source materials for vinyl compounds, useful for the manufacture of synthetic rubbers and plastics. A number of new compounds have been reported and a number of older syntheses have been improved. In general, it has been found that benzene, alkyland alkoxyl-substituted benzenes give satisfactory yields of ethanes, whereas the more reactive phenols, amines, and heterocyclic compounds give only resinous products, and the less reactive halogenated benzenes, nitrobenzene, benzoic acid, and fused-ring aromatics fail to react.

Fuels for internal combustion engines differ markedly in the way in which they burn within the cylinder. Some burn in such a manner that the engine operates smoothly; others cause what is generally known as knocking. Although a great amount of work has been done investigating this matter and many theories proposed, the exact cause of the knocking is unknown. The work done has been largely of two types: (1) use of knock rating engines and (2) studies of the oxidation of hydrocarbons. A very complete review of the work done and theories proposed has been presented by Davis (3) and Ogilvie (7). Only a very brief discussion of the oxidation of hydrocarbons will be given here.[...]</description><creator>Gillies, Archibald.</creator><contributor>Winkler, C.

Just after the last Great War, nitroguanidine, a previously known compound of only academic interest, was found to be an explosive equal in force to T.N.T., and possessing the exceptional property of exploding with a cool flame and hardly any visible flash (1).  When this compound was incorporated with nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine, the resulting cordite was found to possess both the cool explosion temperature of nitroguanidine and the same propellant power of ordinary cordite.  Picrite, as nitorguanidine is more commonly known, and flashless cordite containing Picrite, have several disadvantages, which if overcome would render more easy the preparation, and greatly improve the properties of this new type of propellent.  It was during the course of a study, bent on improving Picrite or finding a substitute for it, that N-guanyl-N’-nitrourea was investigated.  This compound, previously reported in the literature (2) has been thoroughly studied both from the technical and ballistic points of view by the Department of Munitions and Supply, and has been found to fulfill all the specifications required of the flashless component in flashless cordite.

The general problem was to find a suitable thickener for mustard gas, such that the thickened solutions might be used in aircraft spray and in chemical shell. For aircraft spray a liquid was required which had a viscosity approximating 6 poises at l0°C.; for chemical shell, a viscosity of 12 poises at 10°C. was necessary. The solution was to be stable up to temperatures as high as 140°F. for periods longer than one year. In England, chlorinated rubber was found to be a satisfactory thickener for certain types of mustard, but the supply of this material was strictly limited by war conditions. For this reason other thickeners had to be found. In Canada, Shawinigan Chemicals Limited possess facilities for manufacturing polyvinyl acetates (Gelvas) of molecular weights from approximately 5000 to 150,000, so it was decided to try these materials as possible substitutes. [...] The results suggest the practical solution in the thickening problem, a process to remove iron and other impurities from the crude mustard. Such a process, flash distillation, is being developed. Preliminary ageing trials indicate that solutions of Gelva in flash-distilled HS Levinstein are comparable in stability to solutions of HT after 50 days at 60°C.</description><creator>Morrison, James Alexander.</creator><contributor>Maass, O.

This is especially true of forest soils and pastures. In agricultural soils, under crops, the normal equilibrium between groups of microorganisms is slightly displaced by the introduction of plant residues and by the addition of manure. There is also a large addition of cellulose and,at the same time, other reserve material from plowing in the roots of annual crops. In normal soils, cellulose becomes decomposed under the combined action of fungi and aerobic bacteria. Of these two groups of organisms the fungi seem to act more vigorously at first after the addition of cellulose, but their numbers very rapidly drop to normal and it is very likely that the bacteria, which had a slower rise in activity, maintain their action until the excess of the material added has been utilized. No special mention has ever been made of starch hydrolysing microflora in soils. This carbohydrate is less refractory to the attack of microorganisms than is cellulose. Many bacteria which are not typical of the majority of those constituting the soil microflora, are reported to be active in hydrolysing starch. It appears to be assumed that such bacteria represent the true amylolytic flora. This may explain why studies of the starch hydrolysing organisms have never been undertaken.

Particularly in Eastern Canada, even with the general methods of control employed at that time, losses through internal parasitism continued to occur in lambs and breeding stock. In 1936 Swales initiated a thorough investigation into the incidence and economic importance of the parasites of sheep in Canada which eventually culminated in a highly successful control program. One of the key points in this program depended on the over-winter loss of certain infective larvae on the pastures. The species of parasites apparently controlled by this means are believed to be Haemonchus contortus and Oesophagostomum columbianum, both of which may cause severe losses in sheep in Eastern Canada. [...] Thus there was an apparent need for more data on the effect of low temperatures on some of the economically important nematodes of sheep.

The pig must rely largely on its caecum for the breakdown of dietary cellulose, thus the limited capacity of this organ must be considered in the interests of efficiency of production. It is evident that if the animal is forced to consume a diet which is bulky and highly indigestible it may become physically impossible to provide sufficient nutrients to promote maximum gains in body weight. It was such considerations that gave occasion to the early work on oats. This cereal contains about thirty percent of hulls. Oat hulls are composed largely of cellulose which is apparently quite highly lignified. This being the case, it would appear that this portion of the kernel could serve little useful purpose as a source of energy for the Pig. [...] This experiment was undertaken in an attempt to obtain specific information on the effects of fineness of grinding of oats when fed to growing and fattening swine. The growth rates, feed consumption, digestibility coefficients of the individual components of the rations, and nitrogen balances have all been considered in an effort to assess the merits of grinding to varying moduli.</description><creator>Bell, John Milton.</creator><contributor>Crampton, E.
