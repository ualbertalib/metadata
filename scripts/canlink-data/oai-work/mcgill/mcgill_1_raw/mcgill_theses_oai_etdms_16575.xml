Prior to the Union and even well into the eighteenth century Scotland remained very poor. This state of poverty to a lesser or greater degree was common to all. If the farmer, the artisan, cottagers and labourers suffered poverty the gentry experienced acute and chronic lack of money. In this predominantly agricultural country both the lowly and the high-born concentrated most of their energies to eke out from the land as best an existence as possible.</description><creator>Straka, Waclaw.

In 1900, Lewis reported that nitrogen subjected to a condensed discharge gave an afterglow different from those previously obtained from other gases. He described it as a “rich chamois yellow fog”. It lasted for several seconds after the discharge had been turned off, and its spectrum consisted of narrow bands. Several years later, Strutt, who later became Lord Rayleigh, observed that the spectra of elements and compounds excited in the presence of the yellow nitrogen were the same as those produced by other methods.</description><creator>Storr, Catherine.

Sarà, tuttavia, opportuno, come introduzione al nostro studio, dare un breve cemno della vita di Innocent Gentillet e delle sue opere. Tralasciando i particolari, spesso incerti e oscuri, della sua vita, ci fermeremo soltanto sulla linee generali e sui documenti dai quali esse si desumono. I biografi di Gentillet concordano nel dire - ed è anzi questo uno dei pochi punti sui quali sono d'accorda - che egli nacque a Vienne, nel Delfinato, nella prima metà del XVI secolo.

The synoptic features of the stratosphere as shown by the cross sections - are discussed in monthly résumés in sufficient detail to furnish a generalized picture of the seasonal changes. An objective method for determining the peak winds in jet streams is formulated and results from this method compare favourably with meso-scale data from aircraft probes. The baroclinity of the troposphere and lower stratosphere and its relation to the Ferrel westerlies are discussed. Boundary conditions for the crests of the Ferrel westerlies on summer and winter type wind profiles are presented and shown to be quasipermanent in nature.</description><creator>Steiner, Harold.

But in what way does it differ and how do these differences affect the position of the would-be neutralist in the mid-20th century?

As part of this study, a large number of benthic, pelagic and littoral marine animals have been collected, mainly during the expeditions of the M.V. 'Calanus' (Dunbar and Grainger, 1952; Grainger, 1954; Grainger and Dunbar, 1956; Grainger and Hunter, 1959). The marine amphipods taken in the years 1947-1950 in Ungava Bay have already been studied (Dunbar 1954) and one hundred and fourteen species identified. In 1956 I began the study of the marine amphipods obtained by the 'Calanus' during 1951 to 1957 in Hudson Strait, Frobisher Bay, northern Hudson Bay and Foxe Basin.</description><creator>Steele, Donald.

This system is compared with a conventional turbojet with and without reheat and pre-cooling. Within the limitations of the analysis it is seen that the domain of air breathing engines for propulsion can be extended to hypersonic vehicles. The inverted turbojet is an economical cruising engine for hypersonic vehicles at Mach numbers 5-6. However a conventional turbojet with pre-cooling and reheat can power a vehicle throughout the range of Mach 0 to Mach 6.</description><creator>Sreenath, Ananthapur.

This framework is applied to information compiled through library research and field observation; first, to detailed descriptions or the changing Eskimo and Indian cultures, then to the settlements of Aklavik and Inuvik. The results which are derived therefrom are applied in the building or an experimental project designed to test Community Development procedures as a means of improving adaptation.

Experimental points are found to fit a theory which is similar to that used in nuclear magnetic resonance work. The spin-lattice relaxation times round for all three transitions decrease with concentration or the paramagnetic salt in the diamagnetic K3Co(CN)6 dilutant. The spin-spin relaxation time appears to remain practically independant of the concentration in this range. Results round for the spin-spin relaxation times agree within the experimental error with those found by other recent experimenters. Spin-lattice relaxation times quoted in recent literature for the +1/2  - 1/2 transition in K3Cr(CN)6 vary greatly, and it is thus of little use to compare these results.

Rittinger postulated that: “The increase of the surfaces exposed is directly proportional to the force required.” Kick countered that: “The energy needed for producing analogous changes of configuration in geometrically similar bodies of equal technological state varies as the volumes or weights of these bodies.” According to Rittinger, since the surface formed in each stage is double, the energy required to produce each successive stage increases in geometric progression, the ratio being two.</description><creator>Sirois, Louis.

The absolute power of the rulers was limited by the fact that the two original Roumanian dynasties ruled for three centures but did not produce many capable leaders. Since there were no established laws of succession (any member of the princely families could be elected ruler by the assemblies of nobles and clergymen), many struggles for power took place which weakened the authority of the Roumanian princes.</description><creator>Sinder, Alan.

Perhaps this white fibrous plaque was initiated fifty years ago and has existed since then. Perhaps it lost lipid during a period of regression. That ulcerated atheroma may have slowly accumulated lipid following a surface thrombosis five years before death. A yellow plaque which could have developed following an intimal injury may have increased in size by short episodes of lipid accumulation associated with haemorrhage into its substance.</description><creator>Silver, Malcolm.

This thesis is a critical analysis of the way in which the Provincial Government handled this new revenue source. In view of the bleak fiscal history preceding World War II, it is not surprising that short-term tax considerations were given a high priority.</description><creator>Sievwright, Eric.

In this paper we illustrate the method developed by E. Rosenthall for the complete solution of reducible Diophantine equations. This method involves, as a first step, the solution of an equation in ideals belonging to subfields of some normal extension, then passing from ideals to integers belonging to the extension considered. In some particular cases, additional restrictive conditions must be satisfied before a solution may be obtained.</description><creator>Shtern, Isreal. H.</creator><contributor>Rosenthall, E.

Local shell-side, heat transfer coefficients were measured in a typical section between two segmental baffles. Three baffle spacings, with five flow rates at each spacing, were used. The results indicate that the crossflow region can be divided into a dead zone and flow zone. The size of these sub-zones is a function of the area ratio, Ar, and thus the average coefficient is also a function of Ar.</description><creator>Short, Bernard.</creator><contributor>Stachiewicz, J.

Its name, “Kapkivos”, a crab, was derived from the ancient description of breast cancer. Until the Nineteenth Century, it was entirely within the therapeutic province of the physician and surgeon. According to Bett (1957), Bernard Peyrilhe (1735-1804) was the first to conduct a systemic experimental investigation of the causation of cancer, in which he attempted to identify its toxin, and to trace the spread of the disease in order to devise better methods of treatment. Although more than two hundred years have passed since Peyrilhe's attempt, research into the cause of cancer is still one of the most intricate scientific activities of modern times.</description><creator>Shinozuka, Hisashi.</creator><contributor>Ritchie, A.

Even a single side branch has an important effect on the transmission of sound in the main duct. The most prominent example of this is an acoustical side-branch filter. Such filters are used in exhaust mufflers, various types of wind tunnels, jet-engine test cells, air-conditioning systems, and other applications where objectionable noise components have to be eliminated.</description><creator>Serbyn, Myroslav.

This thesis describes an investigation of the hydrogen exchange reaction between cellulose and water and its possible relation to the crystallinity and other aspects of the fine structure and the reactivity of the cellulose. Since present concepts of molecular order in cellulose have been described in many texts, only those aspects which are of interest to the present work will be briefly reviewed here.</description><creator>Sepall, Ola.
