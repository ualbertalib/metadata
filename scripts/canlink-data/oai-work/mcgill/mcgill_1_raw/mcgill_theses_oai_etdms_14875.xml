Among the micro-arthropods, collembola are believed to play an important role in the breakdown of litter and humus (Schaller, 1950). Poole (1959) suggests that the direct value of collembola as litter feeders is probably small, judging solely from their gut contents, but, on the other hand, they must play sorne part both chemical and physical, in the breakdown of humus. He further states that their numbers and activity suggest that they may be of considerable importance. Dunger (1956) and Fourman (1938) are also of the opinion that collembola participate in the decomposition of falling leaves.

Advantages of a superconducting ground plane are investigated and it is subsequently used in all experimental work.The frequency response of the deviee is determined by the time constants of the control circuit and load impedance,resulting in an upper frequency limit of approximately 10 Ke/s. Barkhausen noise is the dominant noise, due to diseontinuous movements of superconducting and normal domain in the intermediate state of the gate. The difficulty of nucleating superconducting domains in a resistive surrounding is believed responsible for hysteresis when the dominant magnetic field is the self-field of the gate.Under certain experimental conditions fluctuations of the gate resistance aye observed, and are shown to be due to thermal instabilities. </description><creator>Schroder, Dieter K.</creator><date>1964</date><subject>Electrical Engineering.</subject><title>The cryotron as a linear amplifier.</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5q47rs32t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q524js31b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9k41zh93z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:29:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Although lymphocytes have been studied for over a century,their function is still an enigma as is their precise mode of formation.

The reason for this importance is due to the presence in these animals of the reticulo-rumen as part of their gastro-intestinal system,which enables the ruminant to utilize roughages as sources of energy, protein, vitamins, and other nutrients. The ruminant has traditionally been the intermediary for the conversion of forage crops into meat, milk and wool. Probably, without ruminant animals, much of the crops now consumed by them would be returned to the soil or consumed by organisms that cannot be utilized by man.

It is now known that phagocytic cells in higher animals provide an effective defense mechanism against a wide variety of bacteria, fungi and protozoa.It has also been suggested that a mechanism closely analogous to phagocytosis may aid in the disposai of submicroscopic parasites and toxins of small molecular dimensions in the mammalian host.

The general principle by which the nervous system achieves this performance is well established. It employs sensory receptors to report how much of the objective is accomplished and, in the light of this feedback, modifies the program of muscular contraction. (Note however that certain rapid movements may be "learned" so well by practice that feedback becomes unnecessary). In the muscle these sensory receptors (muscle spindles) lie in parallel with the muscle fibers and share their attachments, so that they are extended when the muscle lengthens and relaxed when it shortens. The signals (impulses) generated by stretching the spindles travel towards the spinal cord and excite the alpha motoneurons which in turn cause the contraction of the muscle fibers surrounding these same spindles. Therefore an externallyinduced extension of the muscle resulta in an augmented muscular contraction which resists the extension; this mechanism, known as the "stretch-reflex", has the properties of a servo-mechanism,i.e. a self-regulating closed-loop mechanism using feedback from the spindles to maintain a given muscle length.

Because of this, the wards containing each group differ considerably in formal organization. It is hypothesized that these formal differences (to be outlined later) will be reflected in the kinds of informal organization arising in each ward. That is, it is held that any informal differences encountered are at least partially a result of the different formal organization of the two wards. This general hypothesis emerged from reading several recent etudies of formal organizatians. The relevant works are discussed below.

These animals are found to be resistant to a subsequent infection of the same type. The serum of such animals is capable of causing agglutination, opsonization or lysis of the organism whose previous attack has been overcome. The factor in the serum responsible for this reaction is referred to as an antibody and the substance which induced its formation, in this case the virus or bacteria, is called an antigen.

Although man's technical achievements in outer space already stand as monumental guideposts to scientists, the framers devoted to founding the legal regime are only beginning to formulate the structure through which law and order can be effected in this new region. It is, I believe, wise and commendable that the policy making bodies of the world have not been driven by a modern cry for progress in space law and have not set about solving with a sense of urgency imaginary problems based on prophecies of disputes and conflicts in the unexplored, unorganized, and unpopulated region of outer space. The law has kept pace with the needs of society. Legal vacuums have not occurred because of the evolution of the common law and the law of nations was based on the customs and usages of the participants in the particular community concerned. Substantially the same condition and evolution can be expected in the development of space law. [...]</description><creator>Reed, Walter D.</creator><contributor>Vlasic, I.

Elliot Smith (1897b) recount the origins, going back over 100 years, of the concept of a "limbic system" which is distinct from the cerebrum as a whole. The system was named Rhinencephalon by Sir William Turner (1891) because of the close association of some of its components with the organs of olfaction. The most extreme border of the "limbe" or "hem" of the hemisphere comprises the hippocampus. The regular serrations of its dentate gyrus cause it to resemble the primitive sea animal of the same name. Interest in this in-folded, single-layered strip of archi-cortex, bulging into the lateral ventricle, has grown exponentially since those early beginnings.
