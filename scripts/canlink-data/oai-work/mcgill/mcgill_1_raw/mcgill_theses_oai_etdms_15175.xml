We surveyed the microbial diversity of the springs by analyzing clone libraries of the small subunit rRNA gene. Half of the bacterial clones from the GH library classified as Delta- and Gammaproteobacteria. Clones related to Proteobacteria (82%), Firmicutes (9%) and Bacteroidetes (6%) constituted 97% of the bacterial library from CP. At least 56 and 76% of the bacterial clones from GH and CP, respectively, were from putative sulfur-metabolizers, and clones related to the sulfur-oxidizing bacterium Thiomicrospira psychrophila dominated in both springs. Archaeal clones were affiliated with uncultured Crenarchaeota, methanogens and haloarchaea. The eukaryotic clones were related to known Fungi, Viridiplantae (green algae), Strametopila (e.g. diatoms), Cercozoa and Alveolata in the CP sediment. Eukaryotic rRNA genes could not be amplified from the GH sediments. Forty-nine phylotypes of heterotrophic and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (Thiomicrospira, Halothiobacillus ) were isolated from the GH springs. The strains were predominantly psychrotrophic and halotolerant, and were most related to bacteria also isolated from permanently cold environments. Some heterotrophic strains possessed genes for photosynthesis and thiosulfate oxidation, possibly enabling them to better compete in these sulfur-rich ecosystems exposed to continuous light in the summer. Assays of leucine and CO2 incorporation showed a low heterotrophic activity in the GH spring water, but significant autotrophic activity in complete darkness (chemoautotrophy). Microbial sulfur metabolism was demonstrated in microcosms of the GH sediment. Sulfur oxidation and chemoautotrophy were also demonstrated in microbial filaments that thrive in the GH spring channels. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed that the filaments were almost exclusively composed of rod-shaped Gammaproteobacteria that were further identified as Thiomicrospira. This work describes active microbial communities capable of sustainability in extreme environments that combine low temperature, moderate salinity, and prolonged periods of continuous light or darkness. Sulfur oxidation seems to be a major energetic process and chemolithoautotrophy appears to contribute significantly to primary production. Similar hydrosystems, formed by brines in the cold permafrost, are hypothesized to exist on Mars.</description><creator>Perreault, Nancy N.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Microbial diversity -- Nunavut -- Axel Heiberg Island.</subject><subject>Frozen ground -- Nunavut -- Axel Heiberg Island.</subject><subject>Springs -- Nunavut -- Axel Heiberg Island.</subject><subject>Microbial ecology -- Nunavut -- Axel Heiberg Island.</subject><title>Microbial diversity and activity in the cold saline perennial springs on Axel Heiberg Island in the Canadian high Arctic</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1v53k164c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r494vp505</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sx61dq66x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:45:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Hypertension is the number one cause of death worldwide. Low-grade inflammation has been identified as one of the mechanisms contributing to blood pressure elevation and remodeling of the vasculature in hypertension. Mechanisms involved in vascular inflammation and hypertension remain elusive. Vasoactive peptides such as endothelin-1 (ET-1) and angiotensin II (Ang II), oxidative stress and infiltration of immune cells are increased in cardiovascular tissues of hypertensive individuals. Since the vasculature is a major regulator of blood pressure levels, the hypothesis has been proposed that vascular inflammatory responses contribute to development of hypertension. Objectives of this thesis were 1) to investigate the role of T cells in development of vascular inflammation observed in genetically hypertensive rats, 2) to identify vascular sources of reactive oxygen species production in mineralocorticoid-induced hypertension and 3) to study the effect of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma activators on vascular pro-inflammatory signaling pathways in Ang II-induced hypertension. The first study that is part of this thesis shows that the transfer of chromosome 2 from normotensive to hypertensive rats reduces plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, expression of adhesion molecules and infiltration of T cells in aorta as well as resulting in lower blood pressure levels. These effects are accompanied by increased regulatory T cell mediators. We discovered that regulatory T cells are regulated by chromosome 2 and may be responsible for reducing inflammatory responses in hypertensive rats. The second study of this thesis demonstrates in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats that superoxide (·O2-) production originates in part from xanthine oxidase activity induced by the ET-1 system and from mitochondrial sources, particularly complex II of the respiratory chain. We thus have uncovered two sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can stimulate inflammatory responses in hypertension, since vascular ·O 2- production in this model was shown to induce vascular inflammation. The third study of the thesis shows that activators of PPAR-gamma reduce blood pressure levels and signaling pathways including Akt/PKB, SHIP2, ERK1/2, 4E-BP1 in aorta and resistance arteries in Ang II-induced hypertension. PPARy acts as an anti-inflammatory transcription factor, and the present study suggests that Ang II down-regulates PPAR-gamma activity to exert its pro-inflammatory effects. In conclusion, by targeting inflammatory mediators, it may be possible to reduce blood pressure levels in hypertensive animals. This suggests that inflammatory responses may play a crucial role in development of high blood pressure.</description><creator>Viel, Émilie, 1975-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>PPAR gamma -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Hypertension -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Rats, Sprague-Dawley.</subject><subject>Rats, Inbred Dahl.</subject><subject>Mitochondria -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Rats.</subject><subject>Aorta -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Superoxides -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Xanthine Oxidase -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Reactive Oxygen Species -- metabolism.</subject><title>Inflammatory responses in the vascular wall are up-regulated in hypertension and contribute to cardiovascular disease</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9z903349r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sx61dq66x</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x346d760b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:45:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Let {Ij} be an interval partition of the integers, f(x) a function on the circle group T and S(f) = (sum |f j|2)1/2 where f^ j = f^ cIj . In their 1995 paper, Hare and Klemes showed that, for fixed p &amp;isin; (1, infinity), there exist lambdap &gt; 1 and Ap, Bp &gt; 0 such that if l(Ij+1)/ l(Ij) ≥ lambdap, where l(Ij) is the length of the interval Ij, then Ap&amp;par; f&amp;par;p &amp;le; &amp;par;S( f)&amp;par;p &amp;le; Bp&amp;par; f&amp;par;p. That is, {Ij} is a Littlewood-Paley (p) partition. Since the intervals need not be adjacent, these partitions may be viewed as permutations of lacunary intervals. Partitions like these can be induced by subsets of sums of permuted lacunary sequences. In this thesis, we present two main results. First, complementary to the aforementioned work of Hare and Klemes who proved that sums of permuted lacunary sequences were Littlewood-Paley (p) partitions (for large enough ratio), we prove the surprising result that there are sums of permuted lacunary sequences of fixed ratio that cannot be obtained by iterating sums of permuted lacunary sequences of larger ratio finitely many times. The proof of this statement is based on the ideas developed in the 1989 paper of Hare and Klemes, especially with respect to the definition of a tree and to the theorem on the equivalency of a finitely generated partition and the absence of certain trees. These special sums may then be viewed as the critical test case for further progress on the conjecture of Hare and Klemes that sums of permuted lacunary sequences are Littlewood-Paley (p) partitions for any p. Secondly, we use the non-branching case of the method of Hare and Klemes developed in their 1992 and 1995 papers, and further developed by Hare in a general setting in 1997, to prove a result of Marcinkiewicz on iterated lacunary sequences in the case p = 4. This shows that the method introduced by Hare and Klemes can potentially be adapted to partitions other than those they were originally applied to. As well, in considering the proof given by Hare and Klemes (and by Hare in a general setting) that lacunary sequences are Littlewood-Paley (4) partitions, we present a slight variation on one of the computations which may be useful in regard to sharp versions of some of these computations, but otherwise follows the same pattern as that of the above papers. Finally, we prove an elementary property of the finite union of lacunary sequences.</description><creator>Trudeau, Sidney.</creator><date>2009</date><subject>Fourier series.</subject><subject>Littlewood-Paley theory.</subject><title>Littlewood-Paley sets and sums of permuted lacunary sequences</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wh246w445.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x346d760b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9k41zh947</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:45:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The societal burden of autoimmune diseases and donor organ transplant rejection in developed countries reflects the lack of effective immune suppressive drugs. The main objective of my thesis was to develop novel fusion proteins targeting receptors linked to autoimmunity; strategies that will allow the suppression of autoreactive cells while sparing resting lymphocytes. Interleukin (IL) 15 has been demonstrated to exert its effects mainly on activated T-cells triggered via their T-cell receptor (TCR). Since we found that the fusion of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GMCSF) to IL15 - aka GIFT15 - paradoxically leads to aberrant signalling downstream of the IL15R and blocks interferon (IFN)-gamma secretion in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), we hypothesized to use this fusokine in proof-of-principle cell transplantation models and shown that GIFT15 can indeed block the rejection of allogeneic and xenogeneic cells in immunocompetent mice. Additionally, we found that ex vivo GIFT15 treatment of mouse splenocytes lead to the generation of regulatory B-cells (Bregs). These Bregs express high levels of MHCII, IL10 and are capable to block antigen (Ag)-presentation in vitro as third party bystander cells. Moreover, a single injection of these GIFT15-generated Bregs in mice with pre-developed experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) leads to long lasting remission of disease. Along those lines, we also found that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) lead to the paracrine conversion of CCL2 to an antagonist form capable of specifically inhibiting plasma cells and activated Th17 cells. This mechanistic insight informed the design of a second class of suppression fusokine. Namely, the fusing of antagonist CCL2 to GMCSF - aka GMME1. We tested its potential use in autoimmune diseases such as EAE and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We demonstrated that GMME1 leads to asymmetrical signalling and inhibition of plasma cells as well as Th17 EAE/RA-reactive CD4 T-cells. The net outcome of these pharmacological effects is the selective depletion of CCR2-reactive T-cells as demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our data support the use of our fusion proteins as part of a powerful and specific immunosuppressive strategy either as directly injectable protein biopharmaceuticals or through the ex vivo generation of autologous Bregs in the case of GIFT15.</description><creator>Rafei, Moutih.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>STAT Transcription Factors -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Janus Kinases -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Recombinant Fusion Proteins -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Mice.</subject><subject>Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Receptors, Interleukin-15 -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Arthritis, Rheumatoid -- drug therapy.</subject><subject>Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental -- drug therapy.</subject><title>Fusokine design as novel therapeutic strategy for immunosuppression</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r207ts631.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9k41zh947</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:v692t984h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:45:08Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease comprised of distinct biological entities that correlate with diverse clinical outcomes. Gene expression profiling has divided this heterogeneity into luminal, ERBB2+ and basal molecular subtypes. Basal breast cancers are difficult to treat as they lack expression of candidates suitable for targeted therapies and are associated with poor outcome. Elevated protein level of the hepatocyte growth factor receptor, MET, is observed in 20% of human breast cancers and correlates with poor prognosis. However, the role of MET in mammary tumorigenesis is poorly understood. To address this, we generated a murine model that expresses weakly oncogenic mutants of Met (Metmt) in the mammary epithelium under the transcriptional control of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter. We demonstrate that Metmt induces mammary carcinomas with diverse phenotypes and used gene expression microarrays to elucidate gene expression changes induced by Met. Since mammary tumors contained variable contents of epithelium and stroma, we used laser capture microdissection to procure epithelial cells for microarray analysis. Based on immunohistochemistry and expression profiling, we show that Metmt produces tumors with luminal or basal characteristics. From hierarchical clustering, Metmt-induced basal tumors clustered with murine models that share features of epithelial to mesenchymal transition and human basal breast cancers. Moreover, Metmt basal tumors clustered with human basal breast cancer. The status of MET among the human breast cancer subtypes has not previously been addressed. We demonstrate that MET levels are variable across molecular subtypes but show elevation in the basal subtype and correlates with poor outcome. We used a candidate gene approach derived from microarray data to gain an understanding of signals required for Met-dependent tumorigenesis. We investigated Nck adaptor proteins and demonstrate a role for Nck in cell motility and actin dynamics of Met-dependent breast carcinoma cells and show elevated expression in human basal breast cancers. By generating a unique mouse model in which Met is expressed in mammary epithelia, with the examination of MET levels in human breast cancer, we have established a novel link between MET and basal breast cancer. This work identifies poor outcome basal breast cancers that may benefit from anti-MET therapies.</description><creator>Ponzo, Marisa Grace, 1980-</creator><date>2009</date><subject>Breast Neoplasms -- genetics.</subject><subject>Mice, Transgenic.</subject><subject>Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met -- physiology.</subject><subject>Mice.</subject><subject>Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental -- etiology.</subject><subject>Breast Neoplasms -- etiology.</subject><subject>Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental -- genetics.</subject><title>Gene expression profiling of Met receptor tyrosine kinase-induced mouse mammary tumors</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6395wc06f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v692t984h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bc386p03h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:45:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The formability of Mg alloy sheet in the as-hot rolled condition depends on the microstructure developed during hot rolling. In general, the formability of Mg alloys is improved by finer grain sizes. 'Microalloying' levels of calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), and cerium (Ce) have been found to refine the as-cast structure, but there is no information as to whether this effect will be reflected in the as-hot worked structure and formability. Thus, in this work, the effects of microalloying levels of calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), and cerium (Ce) on the microstructures (from as-cast to as-hot rolled) and subsequent hot deformation behavior of AZ31, nominally 3% Al, 1% Zn, and 0.3%Mn, were systematically investigated. To include the effect of solidification rate these alloys were cast in different moulds (preheated steel mould, Cu-mould, and water cooled Cu-mould). One-hit compression testing at temperatures between 250°C ~ 400 °C, strain rates of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 s-1 and strains from 0.2 up to 1.0, was performed to investigate the basic hot compression behavior, while two-hit compression testing was conducted to determine the static softening behavior. Hot rolling of the microalloyed AZ31 alloys was then carried out to study the effects of microalloying on as-hot rolled structure under two sets of rolling schedules. To investigate the formability of these microalloyed sheets, tensile tests were completed over a temperature range between ambient and 450°C, at strain rates between 0.1 and 0.0003 s-1. Results show that Ca and Sr act to refine the as cast grain size and the second phases, consistently promoting fine and uniform as-hot rolled grain structure. With regard to grain refinement, calcium has the strongest effect, whereas Ce is most effective for second phase refinement. In addition, microalloying retards grain growth during hot tensile testing. Multiple alloying presents a combined and complementary effect. A refined and uniform grain structure combined with well dispersed and thermally stable second phases significantly improves the hot formability of AZ31 sheets by promoting dynamic recrystallization (DRX) in the matrix, resisting grain coarsening, and retarding the development of cavitation and necking. Under the superplastic condition of 450°C and 0.0003 s -1, the elongation was improved by 17% with Ca only, 26% with Ca and Ce, 51% with Ca and Sr, and 59% with Ca, Sr and Ce.</description><creator>Shang, Lihong.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Aluminum-magnesium-zinc alloys -- Microstructure.</subject><subject>Aluminum-magnesium-zinc alloys -- Formability.</subject><subject>Microalloying.</subject><subject>Aluminum-magnesium-zinc alloys -- Hot working.</subject><title>Effect of microalloying on microstructure and hot working behavior for AZ31 based magnesium alloy</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/12579w76x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bc386p03h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bz60d108c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:45:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Passive (static) and dynamic studies have shown aroma to be an important aspect of food quality, which can be used to differentiate, classify, and grade foodstuffs, and in some cases it can be used to predict other quality characteristics. Monitoring and control of food aroma changes during food processing can significantly improve the quality of the final product in terms of flavour, color, taste, and overall appearance. Hence, it is a prominent and urgent field of study in the post production systems. Passive aroma detection of unprocessed foods and dynamic aroma detection during food processing was undertaken using a fast GC analyzer -- zNose. During the study on the passive aroma detection, the aroma of Chinese spirits (Fenjiu) and mango (Mangifera indica L.) fruits, (i.e., liquid and solid states, respectively) was analyzed. In the study of Chinese spirits, aroma profiles of Fenjiu liquor samples of different quality levels were acquired and used for quality classification and prediction. Measurements of dielectric properties of the samples were also conducted to estimate alcohol concentration. In the study of mango fruits, aroma changes of mango samples were monitored during their shelf life and used to evaluate mango quality. Ripening and rots were detected with 80% and 93% accuracy, respectively. During the study of dynamic aroma detection, a real-time aroma monitoring and control system was developed for use during microwave drying. Aroma signals of a processed food item were detected with zNose and analyzed with a fuzzy logic algorithm to determine the optimal food drying temperature. Phase control was used to adjust the microwave power level to meet temperature requirements. Carrot (Daucus carota L.) and apple (Malus domestica Borkh) were selected as representatives of vegetables and fruits. In carrot drying, samples could be dried in a short time at high temperatures but the interior of some sample cubes was burnt. Drying at a lower temperature extended the drying process, but led to a great loss of aroma in the finished product.' The best results were obtained at 60°C. Based on these results, a fuzzy logic controller was designed and employed to control the drying process according to carrot aroma changes. To investigate the possibility of aroma improvement without zNose assistance, a linear control method was developed whereby a temperature control profile imitated the fuzzy logic control, but aroma control was not included. With these new control strategies, the carrot color and flavour were significantly improved and less time and power were consumed. Similar results were achieved when apple was microwave-dried. Apple aroma was monitored online during microwave drying processes and controlled with similar fuzzy and linear control strategies. Apple color, aroma, and overall appearance remained intact with the new strategies and less time and power were consumed. In contrast to the carrot drying, a different linear temperature profile was required for apple drying in terms of aroma retention.</description><creator>Li, Zhenfeng, 1968 Oct. 9-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Food -- Odor -- Analysis.</subject><subject>Microwave drying.</subject><subject>Fruit -- Drying.</subject><subject>Vegetables -- Drying.</subject><title>Aroma detection and control in passive and dynamic food systems for superior product</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t148fm699.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bz60d108c</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Bioresource Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x346d761m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:45:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this dissertation, the phenomenology of electromagnetic radiation and high transverse momentum jets in relativistic heavy ion collisions is investigated. These are two very important probes to study the strongly interacting matter at extreme temperatures and/or densities and to investigate the possibility of a phase transition between hadronic matter and quark-gluon plasma (QGP). First, a new channel of direct photon production from a charge-asymmetric QGP is explored in the effective theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at high temperature. The photon production from this new channel is found to be suppressed compared to QCD annihilation process and Compton scattering at low baryon density, but might assume significance in baryon-rich matter. Second, the radiative jet energy loss in a three-dimensional ideal hydrodynamical medium is studied for Au+Au collisions at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). A systematic analysis of the nuclear modification factor RAA is presented for pi0 production at high pT in central and non-central collisions, at mid and forward rapidity. Third, jet energy loss by elastic collisions is consistently incorporated in the same formalism and applied to the study of jet quenching at RHIC. It is found that the nuclear modification factor RAA for pi0 in relativistic heavy ion collisions is sensitive to both collisional and radiative energy loss, while the average energy loss is less affected by the inclusion of collisional energy loss. Last, the nuclear suppression of photon-tagged jets at high pT is studied by incorporating not only direct photons, but the additional sources from fragmentation and jet-plasma interaction. We find that these additional sources are very important for a complete study of the correlations between hard photons and hadrons and even dominate in some kinetic regime.</description><creator>Qin, GuangYou.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Heavy ion collisions.</subject><subject>Quark-gluon plasma.</subject><title>Penetrating probes in relativistic heavy ion collisions</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5d86p384r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x346d761m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gq67jv66j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:45:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Two topics, i.e., the scale effects and the geodesics of random heterogeneous materials will be discussed in this work. When the separation of scales in random media does not hold, the representative volume element (RVE) of deterministic continuum mechanics does not exist in the conventional sense, and new concepts and approaches are needed. This subject is discussed here in the context of microstructures of two types - planar random chessboards, and planar random inclusion-matrix composites -- with microscale behavior being elastic-plastic-hardening (power-law). The microstructure is assumed to be spatially homogeneous and ergodic. Principal issues under consideration are those of yield and incipient plastic flow of statistical volume elements (SVE) on mesoscales, and the scaling trend of SVE to the RVE response on macroscale. Indeed, the SVE responses under uniform displacement (or traction) boundary conditions bound from above (respectively, below) the RVE response, and we show via extensive simulations in plane stress that the larger is the mesoscale, the tighter are both bounds. However, the mesoscale flows under both kinds of loading do not, in general, display normality. Also, with the limitation imposed by currently available computational resources, we do not recover normality (or even a trend towards it) when studying the largest possible SVE domains. The second topic is the geodesic (i.e., shortest path) character of strain fields occurring in elasto-plastic response of planar inclusion-matrix composites. The composites' spatially random morphology is created by generating the disk centers through a sequential inhibition process based on a poisson point field in plane. Both phases (inclusions and matrix) are elastic-plastic-hardening with the matrix being more compliant and weaker than the inclusions, and perfect bonding everywhere. A quantitative comparison of a response pattern obtained by computational micromechanics with that found only by mathematical morphology indicates that (i) the regions of plastic flow are very close to geodesics, and (ii) a purely geometric, and orders of magnitude more rapid than by computational mechanics assessment of these regions is possible.</description><creator>Li, Wei, 1970 May 26-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Composite materials -- Microstructure.</subject><subject>Elastoplasticity.</subject><title>Yield and geodesic properties of random elasto-plastic materials</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9c67wr28c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gq67jv66j</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h989r668w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:45:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Recent observations and numerical simulations have significantly improved our understanding of tornadic storms. However, our knowledge of tornado-genesis remains rudimentary. Necessary atmospheric conditions favoring the formation of tornadoes in supercell storms are known, but sufficient conditions remain elusive. The underlying reason is that the processes involved in environment-storm and storm-tornado interactions are not fully understood, as numerical models in the past lacked sufficient resolution to resolve these interactions satisfactorily. In this thesis, an attempt is made to fill this gap by performing a multi-grid high resolution simulation of a supercell storm spawning a tornado-like vortex. Four grids, with grid sizes of 600 m, 200 m, 70 m, and 30 m, are used to allow explicit simulation of storm-tornado interactions. Diagnostic analysis of the modeling results allows an investigation of the origin of rotation at both the storm scale and the tornado scale. The simulation results showed that the origin of vertical rotation at storm scale during the early stage of storm development is due to tilting of the horizontal vorticity in the environment. This so called mesocyclone then further strengthens by the mechanism of stretching and Dynamic Pipe Effect and descends downwards. During the time of mesocyclone intensification, incipient surface vertical vortices form along the outflow boundary created by the rear flank downdraft due to the process of horizontal shear instability. One of the surface vortices experiences an initial exponential growth in its vorticity by interacting with the descending mesocyclone and merging with multiple smaller satellite vortices. The tornado-like vortex (TLV) which forms has a maximum horizontal wind of 103 m s-1 and a minimum central pressure of 927 hPa. Vorticity budgets of the mesocyclone and the TLV are computed to assess quantitatively the importance of various processes for rotation. Sensitivity experiments were also performed to determine the effect of varying the environmental conditions on the mesocyclone and surface vorticity. It was found that as the low-level vertical shear of the environmental wind increases, the mesocyclone intensifies and favors the intensification of near surface vorticity. The presence of drier layers in the upper and middle troposphere eventually produces a weaker mesocyclone and weaker outflow boundaries. On the other hand, inclusion of the ice phase processes produces a stronger mesocyclone and more intense outflow boundaries to enhance the intensification of near surface vorticity.</description><creator>Santos, Jorge Ruben.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Vortex-motion -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Tornadoes -- Forecasting.</subject><title>Numerical study of a tornado-like vortex in a supercell storm</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pv63g363r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h989r668w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k643b4613</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:45:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis contains a collection of results in computational geometry that are inspired from music theory literature. The solutions to the problems discussed are based on a representation of musical rhythms where pulses are viewed as points equally spaced around the circumference of a circle and onsets are a subset of the pulses. All our results for rhythms apply equally well to scales, and many of the problems we explore are interesting in their own right as distance geometry problems on the circle. In this thesis, we characterize two families of rhythms called deep and Euclidean. We describe three algorithms that generate the unique Euclidean rhythm for a given number of onsets and pulses, and show that Euclidean rhythms are formed of repeating patterns of a Euclidean rhythm with fewer onsets, followed possibly by a different rhythmic pattern. We then study the conditions under which we can transform one Euclidean rhythm to another through five different operations. In the context of measuring rhythmic similarity, we discuss the necklace alignment problem where the goal is to find rotations of two rhythms and a perfect matching between the onsets that minimizes some norm of the circular distance between the matched points. We provide o (n2)-time algorithms to this problem using each of the ℓ1, ℓ2, and ℓinfinity norms as distance measures. Finally, we give a polynomial-time solution to the labeled beltway problem where we are given the ordering of a set of points around the circumference of a circle and a labeling of all distances defined by pairs of points, and we want to construct a rhythm such that two distances with a common onset as endpoint have the same length if and only if they have the same label.</description><creator>Taslakian, Perouz.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Musical meter and rhythm.</subject><subject>Music theory -- Mathematics.</subject><title>Musical rhythms in the Euclidean plane</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kp78gk92f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k643b4613</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:v692t985s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:45:14Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We have conducted an experimental investigation of the solubility and speciation of Mo in HCl-, NaCl-, and NaOH-bearing water vapour, and of the partitioning of Mo between coexisting aqueous liquid and vapour at 300 to 370°C and up to saturated pressure. Our results indicate that Mo concentration is enhanced in HCl-bearing water vapour at fHCl &gt; 0.1 bar, and in NaOH-saturated water vapour, but is unaffected by the presence of NaCl. This suggests that Mo speciates as MoO3·nH2O in water vapour at equilibrium with NaCl or fHCl &lt; 0.1 bar. The dependence of SigmafMo on fHCl at higher acidity points to the formation of Mo oxychloride (MoO2Cl 2). For the system MoO3-NaOH-H2O, log Sigma fMo increases with increasing fH2O, and with log SigmafNa in a ratio of 0.28+/-0.4, but Sigma fNa does not change with increasing fH2O. This suggests the formation of a small proportion of sodium molybdate (Na 2MoO4) in addition to MoO3·nH2O. Our partitioning experiments show that at lower temperature and fluid density, Mo partitions more strongly into the liquid than the vapour, but the Mo concentration in the vapour increases as the temperature-pressure conditions approach those of the critical point of water (374°C and 221 bar), surpassing that in the liquid at ~360°C. The results of our experiments indicate that both the liquid and vapour phases may be important for the transport of Mo in porphyry ore-forming systems, and that vapour-phase solubility is enhanced in high fHCl magmatic gases.</description><creator>Rempel, Kirsten U.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Molybdenum -- Solubility.</subject><subject>Molybdenum -- Speciation.</subject><subject>Porphyry -- Inclusions.</subject><title>The solubility and speciation of molybdenum in aqueous liquid and vapour : an experimental study</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vm40xw45w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v692t985s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:br86b6951</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:45:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Extremely huge quantities of mined ore materials are processed annually to obtain the various types of minerals being the barebones of industry. Impounding the waste materials (tailings) of the mined minerals behind a raised embankment is the major and most common method used for the disposal of theses materials. Due to its execution simplicity and low cost, the upstream raising method has been the most common method used for retaining the disposed tailings in spite of being the most failure-vulnerable one. The sophisticated hydromechanocal behavior of the upstream tailings disposal facilities (UTDFs) during the staged construction makes the traditional approaches of consolidation, stability, and seepage analyses inefficient for producing accurate and, in many situations, correct design and evaluation of the UTDFs. The major objective of this thesis is to propose a thorough procedure for realistically evaluating the hydromechanical response of the UTDFs during their staged construction. The procedure incorporates a numerical model that reflects the combination of important realistic features of the UTDFs, namely (i) the partially saturated flow characteristics under the transient state dominating the facility throughout its operation/construction life; (ii) the two dimensional consolidation response of the facility components under both the partially and fully saturated cases considering (a) the full coupled response between the fluid and the solid phases and (b) the large deformation-nature of the tailings; as well as (iii) the appropriate mechanical behavior of the facility materials including a model that can detect the inception of liquefaction in the liquefaction-susceptible zones of the facility. The influences of a number of operational/construction measures that have been reportedly critical for the stability of the UTDFs are investigated in the light of the proposed model. Moreover, the inappropriateness of the traditional approaches for realistically evaluating the UTDF hydromechanical response during its staged construction is substantiated in the analyses carried out in this work. The conclusions and recommendations drawn from this thesis are paramount not only for the feasibility, preliminary design and risk assessment studies of the UTDF during its operation/construction life but also for the on going analytical investigations and monitoring/instrumentations plans carried out throughout such life.</description><creator>Saad, Bassam.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Tailings dams -- Design and construction.</subject><title>Transient coupled analysis of upstream tailings disposal facilities construction</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h415pf13s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/br86b6951</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0g354j78v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:45:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In general, tailings dams are expected to seep. Anomalous seepage, especially when induced by internal erosion, is a major concern for owners and operators. The long established techniques for monitoring water seepage provide sparse information which may not be sufficient to detect and map the seepage path. Hence, there exists a great need for non-invasive techniques that would be sensitive to changing seepage conditions. The non-invasive nature of the techniques is particularly important because drilling and other penetrating (invasive) investigation methods are normally avoided. Non-invasive techniques such as self-potential and high-resolution resistivity have been significantly improved in the past decade and have been successfully used for water retention dam investigation and monitoring. The main difficulty in the use of these techniques in monitoring sulfide rich tailings dams is the presence of electrochemical potentials that renders the interpretation of the acquired self-potential data difficult. Numerical modelling is one of the latest methods in interpreting self-potential anomalies induced by liquid flow. But, in order to model streaming potentials several parameters need to be measured or estimated; (1) the hydraulic driving force and the hydraulic conductivity are required to solve for the hydraulic pressure distribution; (2) the cross-coupling conductivity distribution is needed to calculate the conduction current source parameter; and (3) the resistivity distribution is needed to determine the resulting potential distribution. The zeta-potential and the resistivity of three pyrite rich tailings from the Abitibi region in Quebec were measured over the pH range 2 to 5 in different KCl aqueous solutions for the purpose of estimating the magnitude of electrokinetic effect induced by mine water seepage and the electrical resistivity variation induced by particle migration. The experimental and theoretical results obtained in the present study are pertinent to the interpretation of self-potential data. The zeta-potential was found to vary from -27 to -2 mV and the resistivity of the tailings was found to increase when fine particles are eroded.</description><creator>El Husseini, Bassam.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Sulfides.</subject><subject>Electric currents -- Measurement.</subject><subject>Tailings dams.</subject><subject>Seepage.</subject><title>Streaming potential measurements in sulfide rich tailings</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7s75dh10n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0g354j78v</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4f16c606r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:45:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Tribocorrosion is a term used to describe the material degradation due to the combination of electrochemical and tribological processes. Due to a synergetic effect, the material loss can be larger than the sum of the losses due to wear and corrosion acting separately. In this thesis, the synergy of wear and corrosion was investigated for different types of material, namely the Ti-6Al-4V alloy, the SS316L stainless steel coated with a thin film of Diamond Like Carbon (DLC), and the SS301 stainless steel coated with a thin film of chromium silicon nitride (CrSiN). A tribocorrosion apparatus was designed and constructed to conduct wear experiments in corrosive media. Sliding ball-on-plate configuration was used in this design, where the contact between the ball and the specimen is totally immersed in the test electrolyte. The specimen was connected to a potentiostat to control its electrochemical parameters, namely the potential and the current. Electrochemical techniques were used to control the kinetics of corrosion reactions, and therefore it was possible to assess separately the role of corrosion and wear in the total degradation of material, and to evaluate the synergy between them. For Ti-6Al-4V, it was found that the corrosion and tribocorrosion depend strongly on the structure of the material. The alpha-equiaxed microstructure with fine dispersed beta-phase exhibited the best corrosion resistance. The corrosion resistance was found to decrease when the basal plane was preferentially aligned parallel to the surface, which is attributed to a low resistance to charge transfer in the oxide films formed on this plane. On the other hand, when wear and corrosion were involved simultaneously, the oxide layer protecting the substrate against dissolution was mechanically destroyed leading to a high corrosion rate. It was found that the hardness was the most important factor determining the tribocorrosion behavior of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy; samples with high hardness exhibited less mechanical wear, less wear-enhanced corrosion, and less corrosion-enhanced wear. For DLC coatings, it was found that interface engineering plays a crucial role in the tribocorrosion behavior of DLC films. DLC films with nitrided interface layer (SS\N3h\DLC) were shown to have very poor tribocorrosion resistance; the DLC film delaminated from the substrate after 50 cycles of sliding wear at 9 N load in Ringer's solution. It should be mentioned that a previous study performed at Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal [4] has shown that the same coating resisted 1800 cycles of dry wear at 22 N without delamination. This demonstrates clearly the effect of corrosion on the wear resistance of DLC films. The use of a-SiN:H bond layer between the SS316L substrate and the DLC film improved significantly the tribocorrosion behavior of the coating. This layer acts as a barrier against corrosion reaction; the polarization resistance was 5.76 GO.cm2 compared to 27.5 MO.cm2 and 1.81 MO.cm2 for the DLC-coated SS316L with nitrided interface layer and the bare substrate, respectively. For CrSiN coatings, it was also shown that nitriding treatment of the substrate prior to deposition reduces significantly the tribocorosion resistance of the CrSiN-coated SS301 substrates. This is attributed to the peculiar morphology of the nitrided surface prior to deposition. The high relives at the grain boundaries of the substrate may be the reason for the generation, during sliding wear, of defects in the film, which makes the infiltration of the liquid easier, and consequently leads to the destruction of the CrSiN film.</description><creator>Azzi, Marwan.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Titanium-aluminum-vanadium alloys -- Corrosion.</subject><subject>Thin films -- Corrosion.</subject><subject>Tribology.</subject><subject>Stainless steel -- Corrosion.</subject><title>Role of synergy between wear and corrosion in degradation of materials</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2227mt35j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4f16c606r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bn999b14s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:45:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>High pressure (HP) sterilization of low acid foods is a process involving HP at elevated temperatures. Data available on HP destruction kinetics of pressure resistant pathogenic, spoilage-causing and surrogate bacterial spores are limited, but essential for establishing such a process. While compression heating could be employed to provide the elevated temperature, accurate data gathering under such conditions is difficult due to rapid heat loss during the treatment. The objectives of this research were to first standardize the set up carrying out HP tests at elevated and stabilized temperatures, and subsequently to evaluate HP destruction kinetics of selected bacterial spores under HP elevated temperature processing conditions. The set-up consisted of a thick insulated chamber for holding samples during the test. A relationship was established for the adiabatic temperature rise milk which was used as the main low acid food medium: DeltaTP = -0.306 + 0.0224Ti + 0.0423P + 4.49x10-4T i2 + 1.31x10-4TiP -- 1.24x10 -5P2 (R2 =0.999, n = 50, SE = 0.20°C, p&lt;0.05). Initial temperatures at 83.5, 91.7, 95.8°C and 80.7, 88.9, 93.0°C provided operating process temperature 121, 130, 135°C, at 800, 900MPa, respectively. Destruction kinetics tests were carried with two strains of Clostridium sporogenes (11437, 7955) and Geobacillus stearothermophilus 10149 spores suspended in milk at 700-900 MPa and 70-100°C. These strains were selected for their relatively high pressue and thermal resistance. The survival counts were well fitted by first order linear models. The D values C. sporogenes 11437 varied from 0.73 min at 900 MPa 100°C to 17.0 min at 700 MPa 80°C HP treatments while they ranged from 6.0 to 833 min at 80-100°C under thermal processing conditions. The D values associated with of C. sporogenes 7955 spores were higher and varied from 1.3 min at 900 MPa 100°C to 38.2 min at 700 MPa 80°C HP treatments, and from 12.1 to 156 min at 80-100°C during thermal treatments. The D values of Geobacillus stearothermophilus 10149 spores varied from 0.6 min at 900 MPa 90C to 20.9 min at 500 MPa 70°C HP treatments with 6.3 to 49.4 min for thermal treatments at 110-120°C. Hence C. sporogenes 7955 spores were the most resistant among those studied. The HP destruction kinetics of C. sporogenes 7955 spores were also studied in salmon and were lower than in milk. Pressure resistance screening of selected group I C. botulinum spores was carried out at 800-900 MPa at 90-100°C. Nominal D values of each strain were evaluated which demonstrated that PA9508B, H09504A and CK2-A were the more resistant spores (PA9508B &gt; HO9504A &gt; CK2-A). HP destruction kinetics of C. botulinum PA9508B spores in milk were evaluated in detail at 700-900 MPa at 90-100°C and parallel thermal treatment at 90-100°C. The survival counts were again described by first order linear models (R2 &gt;0.86). The D values varied from 0.35 min at 900 MPa 110°C to 38.9 min at 700 MPa 90°C for HP treatments and 14.4 to 273 min at 90-100°C for thermal treatments. These demonstrated that HP processing combined with elevated temperatures will accelerate the spore destruction rate. However, the associated D values of C. botulinum PA9508B spores in milk were more resistant than those of C. sporogenes 7955 at 90, 100°C, which indicated that the surrogate may not be very effective for using as a target for verification HP at elevated temperature processing conditions. Overall, this work has demonstrated several findings. The non-pathogenic C. sporogenes 7955 spore was the most resistant surrogate but the pathogenic C. botulinum PA9508B spore was even more resistant. D values associated with HP at elevated temperatures were higher than under conventional thermal treatments, and hence provide accelerated destruction kinetics at least for the non-pathogenic spores and hence better spoilage control. However, from safety point of view the conventional thermal sterility requirements would still persist even under HP processing conditions. Milk as a low acid food medium provided more resistance for HP destruction than fish.</description><creator>Shao, Yanwen, 1967-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Clostridium.</subject><subject>Canned foods -- Sterilization.</subject><subject>High pressure (Technology)</subject><subject>Bacillus (Bacteria)</subject><subject>Food -- Microbiology.</subject><title>High pressure destruction kinetics of bacterial spores in low acid food at elevated temperatures</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p5547v97k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bn999b14s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8g84mq92s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:45:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>As a material whose applications are many and growing, zinc oxide still remains a complex system whose photoluminescent (PL), structural, electrical, and photocatalytic properties have not been fundamentally understood. The luminescent properties of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanocrystals (NCs) are very sensitive to crystal structure, and defect states in zinc oxide, which in turn is very sensitive to preparation methods, post-synthesis workup, and thermal treatments. Understanding and managing this rich defect chemistry is critical to controlling ZnO properties. As the surface-to-volume ratio of ZnO increases as materials enter the quantum regime, the surface defects play a stronger role. The exact role of the defect states and their contribution to the physical and chemical properties of ZnO has been studies in great lengths yet still remains controversial.</description><creator>Spina, Carla.</creator><date>2009</date><subject>Semiconductor nanocrystals.</subject><subject>Zinc oxide.</subject><title>Zinc oxide semiconducting nanocrystals : scaffolds for intrinsic and extrinsic defects</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p8418r77b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8g84mq92s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xp68kk705</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:45:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is comprised of three manuscripts, each concerned with the narrative abilities of school-aged French-speaking children as assessed with the Edmonton Narrative Norms Instrument (ENNI). The three studies involved the same three groups of participants: one group of 12 children with SLI between the ages of eight year three months and nine year nine months, 12 typically-developing children of the same age and 12 typically-developing children matched on language abilities. Each child completed narrative tasks, language abilities tasks and cognitive tasks during one experimental session at their home. The first manuscript compares the ENNI narrative production (story grammar and referential expression) of school-aged French-speaking children to those of English-speaking children of the same age. It also provides data on the use of the ENNI with the school-aged French-speaking population with specific language impairment (SLI) by comparing their performance to the performance of their typically-developing (TD) peers. The second manuscript aims to identify which linguistic and cognitive skills contribute to narrative production of children with and without SLI at two levels: the micro- and the macro- levels. Finally, the third manuscript investigates the impact of variations in syntactic demand on the narratives produced by French-speaking children with SLI in comparison to the narratives produced by their age- and language- matched peers. The discussion summarizes the characteristics of French-speaking children's narrative production, the factors contributing to competency in narrative production, and explores the implications of these findings for language processing of children with and without SLI.</description><creator>Gagné, Andréanne.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Language Development Disorders -- Quebec.</subject><subject>Cognition -- Quebec</subject><subject>Child -- Quebec.</subject><title>Narrative discourse in French-speaking school-age children with and without specific language impairment : development, factors contributing to competency, and pragmatics</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kp78gk93q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xp68kk705</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Communication Sciences and Disorders</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:00000353n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:45:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Aluminum 5XXX alloys are of industrial importance and interest as they combine a wide range of desirable strength, forming and welding characteristics with a high resistance to corrosion. The presence of Mg in these alloys ensures favorable mechanical properties. However, the room temperature stretching performance of these alloys is limited. Moreover, Al-Mg alloys are known for being susceptible to the Portevin-LeChatelier effect when deformed at room temperature. Nevertheless, improvements in ductility can be achieved through warm forming, especially when the ductility approaches superplastic levels. The aim of this study was to test for enhanced ductility in three coarse-grained Al-Mg alloys namely, super-pure Al-3%Mg and Al-5%Mg, and commercial AA 5056 alloy. The temperature-dependent flow stress and rate sensitivity behavior of these alloys was investigated by means of tensile testing using ASTM E8M-04 standard samples. Samples were deformed to 10% strain to allow enough deformation to occur such that serrations in the dynamic strain aging (DSA) temperature/strain rate range would be rendered visible on a stress-strain curve. Using this information, the regions of negative and higher-than-normal strain rate sensitivity ('m') were plotted and tensile tests to failure were performed in the vicinity of maximum 'm'. ASTM E2448-06 standard samples for superplasticity tensile testing were used in this case. A maximum ductility of 170% was recorded with these samples and this was found to increase to nearly 300% when the gage length was shortened. It was observed that the DSA serrations were more prominent at lower strain rates, higher temperatures and higher Mg contents. The results of this study show clearly that if the rate sensitivity is high enough, then enhanced ductility in coarse-grained materials is possible at temperatures well below the maximum test temperature.</description><creator>Samuel, Ehab.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Aluminum-magnesium alloys -- Ductility.</subject><subject>Aluminum-magnesium alloys -- Metallurgy.</subject><title>Serrated flow and enhanced ductility in coarse-grained Al-Mg alloys</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0r9677105.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/00000353n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:d217qt39d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:45:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Heat transfer to canned particulate laden Newtonian fluids was studied during free axial agitation thermal processing in a pilot STOCK retort which was modified to simulate the can motion in continuous turbo cookers. Evaluation of heat transfer coefficients (overall, U and fluid to particle, hfp) associated with canned liquid/particle mixtures, while they are subjected to free axial motion is difficult because of the problems involved with attaching temperature measuring devices to liquid and particles without affecting their normal motion. A new methodology was developed to evaluate U and hfp in Newtonian liquids. The methodology involved first correlating U and hfp as a function of input variables for cans in fixed axial mode of rotation in which both particle and fluid temperatures were measured using thin wire thermocouples. Subsequently, only liquid temperatures were measured in cans using wireless sensors in the free axial mode, and hfp values were empirically computed from the developed correlations and the measured temperatures. An L-16 orthogonal experimental design of experiment was carried out to select system and product parameters that significantly influence hfp and U for particles in the Newtonian liquid. With significant parameters selected, a response surface methodology and two full factorial experimental designs were used to relate U and hfp to process variables in each mode of rotation (fixed and free axial modes). Dimensionless correlations were then developed using the evaluated data for heat transfer coefficients (U and hfp), in canned high viscosity Newtonian liquids (with and without particles) using stepwise multiple non-linear-regressions of significant dimensionless groups. In free axial mode, combining the natural and forced convection, Nu = A 1(GrxPr)A2+ A3(Re) A4 (Pr)A5 FrA 6 (rhop/rhop1)A 7 (e/100-e)A8 (dp/Dc) A9 (Kp/K1)A10 yielded a higher R2 (0.93) than using a pure forced convection model when particles were present in the can. Even in the absence of particles, and with the end-over-end mode of agitation where forced convection dominates, introducing natural convection term (GrxPr), improvedR2 from 0.81 to 0.97. Artificial neural network (ANN) models were also developed for heat transfer coefficient predictions and the trained models gave better predictions than dimensionless correlations. All ANN models developed could be implemented easily in a spreadsheet as either matrices or a set of equations.</description><creator>Dwivedi, Mritunjay.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Canned foods -- Sterilization.</subject><subject>Newtonian fluids.</subject><subject>Canning and preserving -- Quality control.</subject><title>Heat transfer studies on canned particulate Newtonian fluids subjected to axial agitation processing</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b5644w20d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d217qt39d</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xw42nc352</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:45:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In recent years, multicarrier modulation techniques have stirred great interest among engineers and researchers working in the field of telecommunications. Multicarrier systems are characterized by the fact that constellation symbols are modulated in parallel onto several distinct subcarriers. One specific form of multicarrier modulation, referred to as OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing), has been deployed in many applications, such as in wireless LAN (local area network) routers, in high-definition television tuners, and in DSL (digital subscriber line) modems. Multicarrier and OFDM systems have proved to be much more robust against impairments such as impulse noise and sudden channel fadings than their single carrier counterparts. Moreover, channel equalization in OFDM systems can be performed at a very low computational cost by a set of per-subcarrier one-tap equalizers. Despite their many advantages, OFDM systems have a few, but important, drawbacks. In particular, OFDM relies on the inverse FFT for modulation purposes, which leads to a very poor spectral containment and a high susceptibility to narrowband noise. To mitigate this problem, we propose in this thesis to perform multicarrier modulation using a perfect reconstruction (PR) DFT filter bank instead of employing the inverse FFT. The design of such filter banks is addressed using a novel method that guarantees the PR property to be satisfied while the spectral containment is being maximized. Equalization in the proposed DFT filter bank transceiver takes advantage of the fact that the filter banks do not contribute to any distortion due to its PR nature. Two equalization schemes are presented. The first one is based on a zero-padded block linear equalization approach, and the second one utilizes a one-tap per subcarrier configuration. The estimation of the channel coefficients in the proposed transceiver is also addressed. A blind estimation method that exploits the inherent cyclostationarity of the transmitted signal is derived. Computer experiments presented in this thesis indicate that the spectral containment of the proposed PR DFT filter bank transceiver is indeed superior to that of the OFDM system. Moreover, simulations conducted in a DSL-like environment contaminated by a narrowband noise show that the achievable bit rate of the proposed transceiver is much higher than that of a conventional OFDM system.</description><creator>Duplessis-Beaulieu, François.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Fourier transformations -- Data processing.</subject><subject>Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing.</subject><subject>Digital subscriber lines.</subject><title>Multicarrier transceivers using DFT filter banks with perfect reconstruction property</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pc289n474.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xw42nc352</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qz20sx372</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:45:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In the past decade, electrostatic layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly has gained attention because it is a facile and robust method to prepare thin polymer films. Due to the industrial importance and natural abundance of cellulose, its incorporation into LBL films is of particular interest. This thesis examines the use of nanocrystalline cellulose, prepared by sulfuric acid hydrolysis of cotton, in polyelectrolyte multilayer films. Conventional solution-dipping and a spin-coating variant of LBL assembly both resulted in chemically defined, reproducible, and smooth films with adjustable properties. Surface morphology was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and film growth was monitored by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and optical techniques. Orientation of the rod-like cellulose nanocrystals imparted anisotropic film properties, and birefringence was calculated from angle dependent and wavelength dependent optical reflectometry measurements. While spin-coating resulted in radial orientation of the nanocrystals, electrostatic adsorption in a magnetic field led to linear alignment. The internal structure, surface orientation and wettability of these materials were investigated. The attractive and repulsive forces acting close to the surface of the multilayer films in aqueous media were measured by colloid-probe AFM and the interaction forces between the film surfaces and charged colloidal-probes were compared to the predictions of the DLVO theory. The applications and advantages of polyelectrolyte multilayers containing nanocrystalline cellulose and their potential as model cellulose surfaces are discussed.</description><creator>Cranston, Emily D.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Nanocrystals.</subject><subject>Cellulose fibers.</subject><subject>Thin films, Multilayered.</subject><subject>Polyelectrolytes.</subject><title>Polyelectrolyte multilayer films containing nanocrystalline cellulose</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3x816r01s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qz20sx372</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nv935642b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:45:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The past decade has seen extensive research on audio classification algorithms which playa key role in multimedia applications, such as the retrieval of audio information from an audio or audiovisual database. However, the effect of background noise on the performance of classification has not been widely investigated. Motivated by the noise-suppression property of the early auditory (EA) model presented by Wang and Shamma, we seek in this thesis to further investigate this property and to develop improved algorithms for audio classification in the presence of background noise. With respect to the limitation of the original analysis, a better yet mathematically tractable approximation approach is first proposed wherein the Gaussian cumulative distribution function is used to derive a new closed-form expression of the auditory spectrum at the output of the EA model, and to conduct relevant analysis. Considering the computational complexity of the original EA model, a simplified auditory spectrum is proposed, wherein the underlying analysis naturally leads to frequency-domain approximation for further reduction in the computational complexity. Based on this time-domain approximation, a simplified FFT-based spectrum is proposed wherein a local spectral self-normalization is implemented. An improved implementation of this spectrum is further proposed to calculate a so-called FFT-based auditory spectrum, which allows more flexibility in the extraction of noise-robust audio features. To evaluate the performance of the above FFT-based spectra, speech/music/noise and noise/non-noise classification experiments are conducted wherein a support vector machine algorithm (SVMstruct) and a decision tree learning algorithm (C4.5) are used as the classifiers. Several features are used for the classification, including the conventional mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features as well as DCT-based and spectral features derived from the proposed FFT-based spectra. Compared to the conventional features, the auditory-related features show more robust performance in mismatched test cases. Test results also indicate that the performance of the proposed FFT-based auditory spectrum is slightly better than that of the original auditory spectrum, while its computational complexity is reduced by an order of magnitude. Finally, to further explore the proposed FFT-based auditory spectrum from a practical audio classification perspective, a floating-point DSP implementation is developed and optimized on the TMS320C6713 DSP Starter Kit (DSK) from Texas Instruments.</description><creator>Chu, Wei, 1966-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Information storage and retrieval systems.</subject><subject>Multimedia systems.</subject><title>Auditory-based noise-robust audio classification algorithms</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hd76s381p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nv935642b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:b27740146</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:45:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Inquiry pedagogy encompasses many strategies and approaches (e.g., student-centered learning, a participatory role among students and teachers in constructing the curriculum, fostering autonomy) that have been identified to increase intrinsic motivation and mastery goal-oriented approaches to learning. However, little if any investigation has been conducted to investigate the motivation that is experienced among bright and average achieving students when engaged in this learning environment. Csikszentmihalyi's Flow theory is considered an optimal form of intrinsic motivation and has been linked to bright students because they appear to exhibit high motivation when engaged in challenging and interesting material. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether Flow was a good theoretical framework in which to explore the motivation that is experienced among high achieving and average achieving students in inquiry education and traditional settings. Participating students (N = 272, M age = 11.68) were from different instructional settings (i.e., traditional, occasional inquiry, and frequent inquiry classrooms) from upper elementary and early secondary school grades (grades five through eight). Data collection consisted of two administrations of questionnaires that targeted Flow experiences, one in a unit that students had recently completed in their particular instructional environment and the other, being more ideal, explored their experiences in their favorite subjects. Flow was measured using the Flow States Scale - 2; goal orientation and intrinsic motivation were used to further validate the Flow construct and were measured using the Goal Orientation Scale, and the Intrinsic versus Extrinsic Orientation in the Classroom Scale. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with each teacher and eighteen randomly selected students. All students regardless of ability report higher Flow states in inquiry settings than students' experiences from traditional and occasional inquiry classrooms. Additionally, high ability students report the highest Flow states when engaged in their favorite subjects. The quantitative results were corroborated by the interview results.</description><creator>Borovay, Lindsay A.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Motivation in education.</subject><subject>Inquiry-based learning.</subject><title>Inquiry education as a context for the experience of flow</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4q77fw147.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b27740146</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sx61dq676</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:45:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Coriolis force has a subtle, but significant impact on the dynamics of geophysical and astrophysical flows. The Rossby number, Ro, is the nondimensional parameter measuring the relative strength of the Coriolis term to the nonlinear advection terms in the equations of motion. When the rotation is strong, Ro goes to zero and three-dimensional flows are observed to two-dimensionalize. The broad aim of this work is to examine the effect of the strength of rotation on the nonlinear dynamics of turbulent homogeneous flows. Our approach is to decompose the rotating turbulent flow modes into two classes: the zero-frequency 2-dimensional (2D) modes; and the high-frequency inertial waves (3D). First, using numerical simulations of decaying turbulence over a large range of Ro we identified three regimes. The large Ro regime is similar to non-rotating, isotropic turbulence. The intermediate Ro regime shows strong 3D-to-2D energy transfers and asymmetry between cyclones (corotating) and anticyclones (couter-rotating), whereas at small Ro regime these features are much reduced. We then studied discreteness effects and constructed a kinematic model to quantify the threshold of nonlinear broadening below which the 2D-3D interactions critical to the intermediate Ro regime are not captured. These results allow for the improvement of numerical studies of rotating turbulence and refine the comparison between results obtained in finite domains and theoretical results derived in unbounded domains. Using equilibrium statistical mechanics, we examined the hypothesis of decoupling predicted in the small Ro regime. We identified a threshold time, t☆ = 2/Ro2, after which the asymptotic decoupling regime is no longer valid. Beyond t ☆, we show that the quasi-invariants of the decoupled model continue to constrain the system on the short timescales. We found that the intermediate Ro regime is also present in forced turbulence and that interactions responsible for it are nonlocal. We explain a steep slope obtained in the 2D energy spectrum by a downscale enstrophy transfer. The energy of the 2D modes is observed to accumulate in the largest scales of the domain in the long-time limit. This is reminiscent of the "condensation" observed in classical forced 2D flows and magnetohydrodynamics.</description><creator>Bourouiba, Lydia.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Coriolis force.</subject><subject>Rossby number.</subject><subject>Atmospheric turbulence -- Mathematical models.</subject><title>Numerical and theoretical study of homogeneous rotating turbulence</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6h440x34m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sx61dq676</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):15200</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
