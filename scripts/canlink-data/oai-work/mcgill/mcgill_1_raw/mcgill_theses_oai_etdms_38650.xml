The use of this model as a development strategy meant specializing in manufactured goods under a regime of state interventionism and a closed economy. However, after many years of inward-looking policies, ISI collapsed. Moreover, with excessive public expenditures and fiscal mismanagements, Mexico's economic stability started to erode. The result was Mexico's first economic crisis, the effects of which could only be alleviated through loans from International Financial Institutions that were contingent on the implementation of defined policies. Thus, Mexico adopted the neoliberal development model as its strategy for economic growth and recovery. Under this model, trade liberalization, outward-looking policies, and state non-interventionism promised economic growth as a necessary precondition for social justice and development. Mexico's implementation of neoliberal policies, on one hand, has aided its integration into a market-oriented economy in which competitiveness, foreign investment, and technology transfers are considered as paths to economic growth and, on the other hand, has widened the gap between the rich and the poor, and has impeded sustainable development.</description><creator>Uribe, Maria Eugenia.</creator><contributor>Janda, Richard (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Mexico -- Economic conditions.</subject><subject>Globalization -- Economic aspects -- Mexico.</subject><subject>Mexico -- Economic policy.</subject><title>Effects that neoliberalism and globalization have brought to Mexico's sustainable development</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rn301311p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5425kc45w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7h149r47x</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Takeovers play an important role in the economy as they serve to reallocate economic resources to more efficient uses and replace inefficient management. Unregulated takeover bids pose a threat to the interests of the target company shareholders. The legislature pays special attention to takeover bids to make sure that the bona fide interests of the target company shareholders are duly protected. This is the primary purpose of the takeover bid regulation in Ontario. The regulation is also aimed at ensuring the horizontal equity among target shareholders and the efficient functioning of the capital market. This thesis analyzes the present regulation of takeover bids in Ontario and argues that while the whole system of takeover bid regulation is consistent with the proclaimed purposes, there are two issues that fall out of the coherent structure. The restriction on free transferability of shares and the adoption by boards of directors of shareholder rights plans do not enhance the protection of target company shareholders and do not correspond to the proclaimed purposes.</description><creator>Petrova, Elena V.</creator><contributor>Stevens, David (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Consolidation and merger of corporations -- Law and legislation -- Ontario.</subject><subject>Tender offers (Securities) -- Ontario.</subject><title>Regulation of takeover bids in Ontario</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tx31qk610.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7h149r47x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5138jg64v</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>FDI plays an important role in economic life.

Reservoir daily inflow forecasts provide a warning of impending floods or drought conditions and help to optimize operating policies for reservoir management based on a fine time scale. The aim of this study was to determine the best model for daily reservoir inflow prediction through linear regression, exponential smoothing and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques. The Hedi reservoir, the third largest reservoir in south China with a 1.144 x 109 m 3, was selected as the study site. The performance of these forecasting models, in terms of forecasting accuracy, efficiency of model development and adaptability for future prediction, were compared to one another. All models performed well during the dry season (inflow with low variability), while the non-linear ANNs were superior to other models in frontal rainy season and typhoon season (inflow with high variability). The performance of ANN models were hardly affected by the high degree of uncertainty and variability inherent to the rainy season. Stepwise selection was very helpful in identifying significant variables for regression models and ANNs. This procedure reduced ANN's size and greatly improved forecasting accuracy for ANN models. The impact of training data series, model architecture and network internal parameters on ANNs performances were also addressed in this study. The overall evaluation indicates that ANNs are an effective and robust tool for input-output mapping under more extreme and variable conditions. ANNs provide an alternative forecasting approach to conventional time series forecasting models for daily reservoir inflow prediction.</description><creator>Xie, Ming, 1973-</creator><contributor>Nguyen, Van-Thanh-Van (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Bonnell, Robert (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Water levels -- Forecasting -- Methodology.</subject><subject>Reservoirs -- Regulation.</subject><subject>Reservoir drawdown -- Forecasting -- Methodology.</subject><subject>Neural networks (Computer science)</subject><subject>Reservoirs -- China -- Regulation.</subject><title>Prediction of daily net inflows for management of reservoir systems</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8336h3608.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pg15bg907</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8910jw41c</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) plays an important role in angiogenesis and wound healing. The major cell type involved in angiogenesis are microvascular endothelial cells. Endoglin, a transmembrane glycoprotein, is highly expressed on vascular endothelial cells and has been shown to bind TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta3 and inhibit TGF-beta-induced responses. Mutation in the endoglin gene has been implicated in hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1 (HHT1), a dominantly inherited vascular disorder. The role of endoglin in regulating TGF-beta function in the microvasculature is not well understood. The initial interactions on the cell surface between endoglin and the TGF-beta receptors may be an important mechanism by which endoglin modulates TGF-beta signaling and responses. In this study, we show for the first time that on human microvascular endothelial cells, endoglin forms a heteromeric association with betaglycan, a TGF-beta receptor with which endoglin shares limited homology. This complex formation can occur in both a ligand-dependent and ligand-independent manner. In addition, we demonstrate the occurrence of three higher order complexes which contain endoglin and the TGF-beta type II and/or type I receptors in different numbers or ratios. Our results suggest that endoglin may modulate TGF-beta signal transduction by interacting with betaglycan and the TGF-beta signaling receptors on the cell surface in different ratios.</description><creator>Wong, Soo Hang, 1971-</creator><contributor>Philip, Anie (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>Characterization of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-_) receptor profiles on human dermal microvascular endothelial cells</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rn3013137.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8910jw41c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Surgical Research</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1v53jz962</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Ribonuclease H (RNase H) family of enzymes selectively degrades the RNA strand of DNA/RNA hybrids. Using a sense strand which contained the minimum natural RNA gap requirement, the kinetic rates of degradation of a series of heteroduplex substrates containing 2'F-ANA antisense oligonucleotides of variable flexibility were examined. Results from these studies implicate flexibility of the antisense oligonucleotides as a major requirements for RNase H catalytic efficiency. In addition to the above, physicochemical studies have revealed the thermal stabilities and relative conformations of these modified heteroduplexes under physiological conditions. All of the above findings offer further insights into the physical binding and catalytic properties of the RNase H-substrate interaction, and have been incorporated into a revised model for the mechanism of action of this crucial enzyme.

Three types of fatty acid SAMs were studied: (i) alkane phosphonates, (ii) alkanoic acids and (iii) hydroxy carboxylates. The samples were produced by adsorbing the surfactants on the metal oxides and were characterized primarily by solid-state NMR techniques. Mixed monolayers were produced by co-adsorbing two different types of fatty acids, one of which was perdeuterated. The degree of miscibility was assessed by 1H-2H cross-polarization magic-angle-spinning (CP/MAS) experiments. Whereas phase separation in bulk fatty acid mixtures could be qualitatively detected, chain end intercalation in the case of mixed monolayers on colloidal substrates made determination of miscibility inconclusive.</description><creator>Yach, Kimberly.</creator><contributor>Reven, L.

These holes (termed cryoconite holes) are formed when wind-blown dust gathers in small depressions in the ice causing vertical melting by absorption of more radiation than the surrounding ice. The communities are complex microbial consortia of heterotrophic bacteria, cyanobacteria, eukaryotic algae, and protists. Samples were taken from cryoconite holes on Canada Glacier, Taylor Valley, Antarctica (77°37'S, 162°55'E) and on White Glacier, Axel Heiberg Island, Nunavut Territory, Canada (79°27'N, 90°40'W). Water from Canada Glacier cryoconite holes contained significantly higher concentrations of nutrients and had higher pH values and conductivities, relative to the White Glacier meltwater. Cryoconite communities on the Canada Glacier were dominated by cyanobacteria, either coccoid or filamentous, while the White Glacier cryoconite holes showed an abundance of either saccoderm desmids or filamentous cyanobacteria. Canada Glacier communities were found to be associated with environmental gradients whereas White Glacier cryoconite ecosystems were not.</description><creator>Mueller, Derek.</creator><contributor>Pollard, Wayne H.

ASP is an adipose tissue hormone that facilitates adipocyte uptake of serum fatty acids and their storage. Mice lacking ASP have less adipose tissue mass, despite increased food intake, than wild-type littermates. We hypothesize that the unstored fuels are oxidized through UCP (thermogenic mitochondrial carriers). In male ASP-deficient mice mRNA levels were measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and the following changes were observed: UCP-1 decreased in all tested tissues, UCP-2 increased by 15% and 6 fold in muscle and white adipose tissue and UCP-3 increased 2.5 and 10 fold in muscle and epididymal adipose tissue, respectively. In female ASP-deficient mice UCP-1 decreased in all tissues, UCP-2 increased by 10% and 40% in inguinal and brown adipose tissue, respectively, and UCP-3 remained stable in all tissues. High fat diet nullified these differences, and decreased all wild-type UCP levels. We propose that UCP-2 and 3 assume the role of UCP-1 in fuel utilization, thus helping mice face an increased energy load in the absence of ASP.</description><creator>Simion, Oana-Maria.</creator><contributor>Cianflone, Katherine (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><title>Uncoupling proteins mRNA levels in mice lacking acylation-stimulating protein</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b5644t31h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rv042v732</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:b8515q186</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The somatosensory neocortex processes extrinsic information from the thalamus and intrinsic information from local circuits. We compared the effects of acetylcholine (Ach) on neocortical field potential responses evoked by stimulation of the whiskers and by local electrical stimulation in the upper layers of the neocortex vibrissae representation ("barrel cortex") of adult rats anesthetized with urethane. The two responses differed in terms of their frequency-dependent dynamics. In particular, the whisker response depressed when stimulated repetitively, whereas the intracortical response did not. The cholinergic system was manipulated in the barrel cortex by application of exogenous Ach using microdialysis, by increasing the endogenous levels of Ach with physostigmine and by applying specific cholinergic agonists. The results revealed that Ach selectively enhances the sensory response relative to the intracortical response via a nicotinic effect. Thus, pathways in the barrel cortex are differentially regulated by cholinergic inputs.</description><creator>Oldford, Elizabeth.</creator><contributor>Castro-Alamancos, Manuel A.

Problems related to computer performance usually occur either because the system is not correctly sized or because its resources are not adequately allocated. Performance analysis of computer systems is the process of evaluating the current performance of a system by monitoring and studying its behavior under different loads. It involves a deep understanding of the functioning of the basic components of a system. Performance analysis is typically followed by performance tuning, in which required changes are applied to the system in order to achieve optimum performance. In this thesis, we discuss the basics of performance analysis. The different resources of a system are described and an overview of performance-monitoring tools for these resources is presented. An application of performance analysis is also included: two new major systems at McGill University are analyzed (the library management system ALEPH and the finance system BANNER).</description><creator>Perucic, Michele.</creator><contributor>Ratzer, Gerald (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Performance analysis of computer systems</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0z708z608.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5138jg654</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1g05fd58t</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:52:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The primary objective of this thesis is to explore the effect of omitting a strong prognostic factor from Cox's proportional hazards model when analyzing data from randomized trials. The secondary objective is to provide an overview of the Cox model. We first present the properties of the model, the method of maximum partial likelihood and the elements available on which to draw inferences concerning parameters. We then discuss various methods used to assess the tenability of the proportional hazards assumption as well as ways to incorporate non-proportional hazards in the model. In the third and final chapter, we address the primary objective of the thesis. In linear regression analysis, unbiased estimates of the effect of the intervention can be obtained even when important but balanced determinants of the outcome are omitted from the model; the precision of the estimates are improved, however, with the inclusion of strong covariates. The logistic and Cox regression (and other non-linear) models do not share this property, however. We discuss the literature on this topic and provide examples to illustrate the problem. We examine the situation for the Cox model in more detail with the analysis of data from an experiment on the effect of increased sexual activity on the longevity of male fruitflies.</description><creator>Ishak, Khajak.</creator><contributor>Hanley, James A.

The present cross-sectional study investigates a hypothesized association between closed contact points in the primary dentition and approximal caries formation. It was carried out using a convenience sample of 286 children receiving dental care at the Montreal Children's Hospital. Bivariate analysis was performed using odd ratios, to determine which independent variables collected by the survey had a significant association with the dependent variable (approximal caries). Significant independent variables were then controlled for in multiple logistic regression analysis.

Within the stands, bats were sampled in the canopy, the understory layer, and within canopy gaps. Forest structure was measured within each of the stands. The activity of bats was compared among forest stand types, within the stands, and in relation to forest structure. Also, maintaining forest wildlife populations requires data on the use of snags (i.e. dead trees). To provide further resolution of the habitat requirements of forest-dwelling bats, radio telemetry and exit counts were used to investigate the roosting ecology of mouse-eared bats (Myotis lucifugus and M. septentrionalis). Characteristics of snags used by mouse-eared bats were compared with randomly located snags and random geographic points, at three spatial scales (focal tree, surrounding forest, and landscape).

During gaze stabilization, we first rotated the heads of three Rhesus monkeys over the frequency range 5--25 Hz. The VOR was compensatory across all frequencies tested; mean gains (eye velocity/head velocity) were near unity, with phase lag increasing only slightly with frequency. Transient perturbations ≥80 Hz were then used to further probe VOR dynamics. During periods of gaze stabilization, VOR response latency to the transient perturbations was 5--6 ms, and mean gain induced was near unity for two of the three animals tested. The same perturbations were then applied at different intervals before, during and following 15°, 40° and 60° gaze shifts. The VOR elicited was generally attenuated compared to that evoked during gaze stabilization, and the level of suppression tended to decrease with time from gaze shift onset. We conclude that models for the control of gaze should be modified to account for the time course of VOR gain changes during gaze shifts.</description><creator>Huterer, Marko.</creator><contributor>Cullen, K.

Using the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans as model system, mutation in twp-1 (t&amp;barbelow;ime w&amp;barbelow;arp) gene was found to significantly delay biological timing and remarkably increase mean and maximum life span. The rate of living in twp-1 is dramatically delayed in all the biological processes we tested, including rates of rhythmic adult behaviors, development, and reproduction. Oxygen consumption, which indicates metabolic rate of an organism, is reduced to approximately two-fold in twp-1 mutant. According to my study, twp-1 and dauer genes, daf-2 and daf-16, interact to determine biological timing and adult life span. twp-1 mutation prolongs life span in a way that is at least partially different from dauer formation mutants, whose longevity might due to their high resistance to stresses, especially oxidative stress. twp-1 gene is cloned and found to encode iron-sulfur protein (ISP) in complex III, which is the major site of mitochondrial superoxide radical production, of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This suggests that twp-1 may live long because they produce less reactive oxygen species (ROS), and thus, result in less oxidative damage. mts-1 (mitochondrial twp-1 suppressor) mutation can fully or partially rescue most of the biological timing in twp-1 mutant, including both developmental and behavioral rates, but except life span. mts-1 encodes another subunit of complex III, cytochrome b, which normally interact with ISP during function. mts-1 might somehow restore the activity of complex III, and consequently, accelerate the rate of living. Paraquat, a herbicide that induces the formation of superoxide, was used to provide an acute oxidative stress to animals. twp-1; mts-1 was found to be highly resistant to paraquat, indicating that twp-1 animals are well capable of coping with oxidative stress.

Throughout the 1999 breeding season, behavioral observations were carried out on eight pairs of captive-reared Hawaiian crows. Due to the limited size of the captive population, and to avoid inbreeding, birds were paired based on their genetic profiles. As a result, there were differences in age and breeding experience within pairs. There were also differences in rearing conditions between mates. It has been suggested that social play and other affiliative behaviors may be important in young birds to form normal social bonds later in life. Affiliative behavior, such as allopreening and feeding other, was common among social-reared crows, but was virtually absent in isolate-reared individuals. Conversely, isolate-reared crows displayed various forms of aberrant behavior, including inappropriate play and self-mutilation, significantly more than the social-reared individuals. Since such behaviors occurred in the nest area throughout all phases of the breeding season, namely nest-building, egg-laying and incubation, it would appear as if early rearing condition plays a role in future reproductive success.</description><creator>Druker, Bill B.</creator><contributor>Titman, Rodger (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Hawaiian crow -- Behavior.</subject><subject>Hawaiian crow -- Reproduction.</subject><title>Rearing and environmental factors influencing aberrant, affiliative, agonistic and nest-building behaviors in the Alala (Corvus hawaiiensis)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3197xn468.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tq57ns71r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cr56n299k</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:52:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The polyamines spermine and spermidine are found ubiquitously in all mammalian cells where they play a role in a variety of cellular processes. In recent years, the interaction of polyamines with a number of structurally and functionally distinct cation channels has been described. These studies have shown that intracellular polyamines cause a voltage-dependent block of currents from inwardly rectifying K+ channels, AMPA and kainate type glutamate receptors, and neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. As result of the voltage-dependent polyamine block, these channels conduct current at negative membrane potentials but do not conduct current at positive membrane potentials. This property is termed inward rectification and likely plays an important role in the function of these channels. The focus of my thesis has been to study the polyamine mediated inward rectification of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). To determine whether spermine causes the rectification of nAChRs in native neurons, I used the Gyro mouse model that lacks spermine due to a deletion in the gene coding for spermine synthase, the enzyme that catalyzes the production of spermine.

It has been postulated that this may be related to the positive effect of nicotine on cognition. We evaluated the effect of nicotine on attention and eye movements, domains in which schizophrenic patients have robust deficits. Patients (n = 19) who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and Controls (n = 15) were given a Nicoderm 14 mg patch in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, and performance on various attention tasks (Continuous Performance Task (CPT), Stroop, Treisman, Dixon-Lupien), and oculomotor tasks (fixation, smooth pursuit, saccades and antisaccade) was assessed. Nicotine significantly improved attention (CPT hit rate) in patients (p &lt; 0.02) and not in controls. Nicotine increased pursuit gain (p &lt; 0.01) and decreased antisaccade errors (p &lt; 0.01) in patients and controls equally. The magnitude of the improvement on eye movement and attention tasks did not correlate with plasma nicotine concentration (measured by RIA). We conclude that nicotinic mechanisms modulate attention and oculomotor functions and that the effect of nicotine on pursuit may be mediated by attention.</description><creator>Depatie, Lana.</creator><contributor>Lal, S.

Without an effective association, state estimation is at risk. Without an efficient state prediction, the performance of an associator can be degraded. In developing an assignment strategy the crucial issue is whether to assign a track or observation as belonging uniquely to another observation or track, or to allow a track to be associated non-uniquely with multiple candidate observations. This thesis presents a comparative study of two assignment alternatives, namely the NC (unique association of a measurement to an existing track) and JPDA (nonunique association of a measurement to an existing track) algorithms. These assignment strategies were combined with an Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) positional estimator, which superiority over the other single scan algorithms has been largely documented. The respective tracking performance of the IMM-JVC and EV1M-JPDAF algorithms for multiple target tracking has been evaluated. After a detailed description of the IMM-JVC and IMM-JPDAF formalisms, and the IMM-JPDAF implementation issues, an analysis of the results of NC association compared to JPDA association is presented. Simulation results obtained on two scenarios involving two closely maneuvering aircraft confirm the superiority of the IMM-JVC.</description><creator>Hadzagic, Melita.</creator><contributor>Michalska, Hannah (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Comparative analysis of the IMM-JVC and the IMM-JPDA algorithms for multiple-target tracking</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z603r0309.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fb494b219</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g445cg17t</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:52:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The activity coefficients of glycylglycine and DL, alpha-aminobutyric acid in four aqueous electrolyte solutions (+NaCI, +NaBr, +KCI and +KBr) were obtained at 298.2K. The mean ionic activity coefficient of the electrolyte in aqueous solutions containing these biomolecules was determined from measurements of the potential differences of a cation and an anion ion-selective-electrodes, each measured versus a double junction reference electrode. For systems containing glycylglycine, the results show that the nature of the anion has a major effect on the activity coefficients of glycylglycine. Comparison of activity coefficient data for glycylglycine with literature data for glycine, both in aqueous NaCl solutions, indicates that the effect of the electrolyte is larger for the peptide than for the amino acid. For the peptide, in all cases, the effect of the electrolyte is more important at low molalities of the electrolyte. The Wilson equation was used to correlate the activity coefficient data obtained. The correlation results were satisfactory for the region of concentrated electrolyte. For systems of DL, alpha-aminobutyric acid in electrolyte solutions, the cation was found to have a significant effect on the activity coefficients of DL, alpha-aminobutyric acid. There exists a distinctively different tendency of the activity coefficients in the dilute and in the concentrated regions of electrolyte in the presence of DL, alpha-aminobutyric acid.</description><creator>Chung, Mi Young, 1972-</creator><contributor>Vera, Juan H.

Other phases, specifically martensite, have not been examined in complex microstructures since there exists peak overlap with ferrite. This research looks at using neutron diffraction as a means to characterize martensite in a multiphase steel microstructure, thus providing a more complete characterization tool. Three low carbon steels, comprised of a dual-phase, ferrite-martensite microstructure, were used in this study. Two diffraction methods were investigated; a direct deconvolution of the martensite peaks from the ferrite peak, and an indirect determination of martensite volume fraction from ferrite peak broadening. Lastly, mechanical properties were investigated in order to determine if a correlation exists with ferrite peak broadening. The results indicate that the martensite phase has a prominent strain broadening effect in diffraction. The nature of this strain effect was hypothesized and a model was developed to confirm the findings. Finally, tensile testing showed that the mechanical properties were dependent on peak broadening and martensite volume fraction.</description><creator>Filippone, Roberto.</creator><contributor>Yue, Steve (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</subject><title>Martensite characterization in multiphase steels using neutron diffraction</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ht24wm072.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vx021h033</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jq085n09c</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:52:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Parallel optical interconnects (POIs) promise to deliver tremendous gains in bandwidth for applications such as massively parallel computing systems and telecommunication switches. At the core of any interconnect solution lies the fundamental problem of reliable transmission. Next-generation optical communication designers are running into hard limits when it comes to increasing data transmission rates and reducing errors. These two factors are typically in opposing balance: minimize bit error rate (BER) and data rates suffer, increase transmission rates and data integrity is compromised. To answer these design challenges, this thesis proposes to use forward error correction (FEC) codes in an attempt to simultaneously improve data throughput, reduce BER and reduce power consumption. To verify that this is indeed possible, an optoelectronic-VLSI (OE-VLSI) chip with a FEC module was implemented in CMOS. This chip was designed in the context of a POI prototype system to demonstrate 1080 optical interconnections between two OE-VLSI chips.</description><creator>Faucher, Julien.</creator><contributor>Plant, David V.

Involuntarily settled at the coast since 1967, the Mushuau Innu have been removed from their traditional way of life through the circumstances of sedentarisation, while concurrently being marginalised with respect to mainstream Canadian and global economies. Currently, they are in the late stages of settling a comprehensive land claim agreement, near completion of a new village settlement in Natuashish at Shango Pond, and involved in Impact Benefit negotiations over the Voisey's Bay mine. This thesis explores the potential for implementing a Harvesters' Support Programme for Innu hunters as a tool within the Mushuau Innu's emerging development contexts. It is concluded, based on considerations of tradition, social organisation, sensitivity to contemporary gender realities, and emerging social and economic realities, that a programme differing from any currently extant could be appropriately implemented.</description><creator>Salsberg, Jonathan S.</creator><contributor>Scott, Colin H.

It focuses specifically on the allophones [J, J] produced by the Flapping (or Tapping) of medial and final alveolar stops in North American English. Through an exhaustive examination of the ESL and TESL pronunciation manuals that have been published in the last thirty years or so, an assessment is first made of the manner and extent to which this widespread phonological process has been dealt with by the authors of such books. These findings are then compared with the opinions expressed by researchers in the field of second language education in order to determine what sort of consensus currently exists on this issue. The general conclusion is that since flaps are demonstrably the most salient of all NAE allophones and occur as phonemes in the first language of many ESL learners, these segments should be given due consideration in any pronunciation curriculum.</description><creator>Picard, Marc.</creator><contributor>Winer, Lise (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>English language -- Phonetics.</subject><subject>English language -- Phonology -- Study and teaching.</subject><subject>English language -- Pronunciation.</subject><title>On teaching the pronunciation of allophones : the case of flapping in North American English</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ws859h425.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qn59q5950</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Second Language Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):38675</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
