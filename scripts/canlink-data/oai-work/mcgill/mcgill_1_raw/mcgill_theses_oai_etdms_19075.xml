Before the advent of the railway, settlement and civilization in the Dominion was confined to the sea coasts and to the banks of our great river systems. These "scattered and weak boundaries" of "a number of inconsiderable colonies”, as one of the Fathers of Confederation with some rhetorical exaggeration phrased it, “isolated and feeble", were dispersed along a narrow belt of territory from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Intercourse with the interior was hazardous and uncertain; the fur trade flourished but commerce, in the modern sense, was unknown.</description><creator>Hubscher, Frank.

Il est un peu a part dans le siècle dans ce canton des "Fables" et des "Contes" dont il est comme prisonnier. Cependant quand il discourt sur son art il semble bien proche de ses amis et se réclame de la même esthétique qu'eux. La première partie de notre travail va consister à voir ce que La Fontaine pense de la poétique classique. On examinera surtout ses écrits "théoriques", ses préfaces, ou des réflexions semées au hasard dans ses oeuvres, pour voir en quoi il est d'accord avec les idées des autres auteurs classiques. Dans la deuxième partie, c'est l'oeuvre même de La Fontaine qui sera passée en revue pour voir si elle répond à cet idéal invoqué par le poète.</description><creator>Holt, Irene.

The scatterer is illuminated by a quasi-plane wave generated by collimating the field from a point source by a microwave lens. It is shown that the back-scattering coefficients of metal discs of radii one to six to wavelengths can be measured with considerable accuracy using a lens thirty-three wavelengths in diameter. Backscattering by circular cylinders also is discussed. Perturbations of the back-scattered fields, due to diffraction by the finite lens aperture are evaluated theoretically. Two new features of the diffraction fields associated with lenses are explained: the field in the plane of a circular aperture, due to incident spherical waves, is predicted by an empirical equation; the field near the surface of a dielectric lens is explained qualitatively. Investigations on an isotropic artificial dielectric, and on a lens constructed from it, are described.</description><creator>Hogg, David. C.</creator><contributor>Woonton, G.

These measurements have revealed a new effect: flicker noise and shot noise, generated within a tube at very low frequencies, modulates the radio frequency oscillation and in doing it produces radio frequency noise. At frequencies close to the carrier this noise greatly exceeds the noise from all previously recognized sources. Spectrum and correlation measurements have been made on bath the audio frequency and the radio frequency noise generated simultaneously by an oscillator tube. The spectra of the radio frequency and the audio frequency noises corresponded. Other measurements showed that the noise trains were as much as seventy percent correlated up to the limit of measurement, namely 10 kilocycles per second different for the carrier frequency. A method is provided for the calculation of the magnitude of the noise arising from this source.</description><creator>Hamilton, Hugh. A.</creator><contributor>Woonton, G.

The description includes about three hundred square miles surrounding the feldspar deposits. The topography of the area is greatly influenced by the structure of the bedrock. Near the sea, where the land surface is low, bays and peninsulas form an irregular shoreline. Shape and location of the bays are determined by the strike and extant of the softer sedimentary rocks which underlie the submerged valleys.</description><creator>Hamilton, Erwin.

The question of minority rights has in general received much more attention in public law than it has in connection with limited companies. The development of principles and institutions for the protection of the political, racial or ethnic minority has no counterpart in the field of company law. In certain democratic states we now have in proportional representation, for example, a technique for stressing minority representation. One hardly finds trace of such emphasis in the commercial law.</description><creator>Gyorgy, Dezso.</creator><contributor>Anglin, J.

The source is designed for a single-focusing mass spectrograph for the mass-identification of radioactive positive ions. Electrons from a hot cathode focused by a weak magnetic field (400 gausses), oscillate in a reflection type electric field to generate positive ions in a metallic vapour issuing from an internal furnace. Positive ions are partially focused by the electron space charge. The source is mono-kinetic within 3 volts. Positive ion currents of 3 x 10-9 A of Cadmium were obtained at moderate furnace temperatures for electron space currents of 15 ul.</description><creator>Groves, Trevor.

Out of the increased need for knowledge of such structural functional relationships has grown the branch of histological study known as histochemistry. Its researches are dedicated to the development of new and useful chemical, physical and biological techniques which may be applied at the cellular or tissue level for the elucidation of such varied functions as, for example, enzyme action, secretion, or reproduction.</description><creator>Greulich, Richard.

Among these concepts belongs that of Time: it is indeed almost certain that in this case no manner of inquiry other than philosophy is suited to provide tools of analysis. On the other hand time necessarily enters as an element of any economic argument unless such an argument is restricted to operating within the framework of most simplified, unrealistic assumptions.</description><creator>Grasberg, Eugeniusz.</creator><contributor>Weldon, J.

No extensive study on the growth rate of the Arctic char has been found, nor has growth been the subject of more than superficial attention in the small number of works discovered which have dealt with it.

In 1952 several proposed methods of evaluating comparative yield trials were compared with the "Standard Method" presently in use at Macdonald College. Inconsistent exceptions precluded the possibility of separating varieties into three distinct classes according to their green yield ranks, with the object of eliminating the class with the lowest yield. A "Whole Ear Method" in which unchopped ears were sampled was of comparable accuracy to the "Standard Method" of harvesting. "Methods of Combining Green Plant Materials" and the "Standard Method" produced comparable data; complications of field operation inherent in the former methods preclude their extended use. It may not be necessary to samp1e every replication for percentage dry matter estimations.</description><creator>Goyette, Louis. E.</creator><contributor>Brawn, R. I.
