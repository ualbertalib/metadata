Numbering some 60,000 at the time of the British conquest of Canada in 1163, the French, by virtue of a high rate of natural increase, have grown to almost 3,000,000 in this country. The traditions and customs peculiar to French Canada center around the most cherished elements of its culture: the French language and the Catholic religion. These, in contrast to English Protestantism, are the main distinguishing factors between the two major ethnic groups in the Province of Quebec. Essentialy local and personal, and wedded to the soil, the traditional French Canadian culture, while protected by constitutional guarantees, developed and expanded in a state of comparative isolation. During the last few decades, however, secular conditions essential to the maintenance of cultural separateness have been disappearing steadily. Economic expansion, spreading from technically more advanced societies to undeveloped regions, has been the universal agent of culture contact and concentration of population in large urban centres.

In general terms, however, it may be said that they have two principal uses: (l) They are applied by a teacher to his pupils in order to determine the effectiveness of his own teaching; and (2) they are also, and more frequently, employed by a teacher or by some external authority to test the eligibility of an examinee for some certain desired award. The nature of the award will obviously vary vrith the conditions of the examination. It may consist merely in a formal recognition of the successful completion of some "course," or of some section of a course; it may be a credential ensuring admission to some more advanced level of educational pursuit or of public service; it may be some coveted honour or material prize; or, as in many cases, it may be a combination of all or any of these elements.

The school leaving age, of course, varies with the standards of the community and its laws. But all public school students, particularly of adolescent age, must sooner or later consider this academic work partly as the training for some specific occupation, career, or job. The important question before the community today, then, is a classification of the relationships between the educations we give and the vocations we seek. Such a problem involves an understanding of the primary school system and its adequacy; the relation of elementary to secondary and higher types of education; the facilities for technical and commercial training, the demands of current and future industry, and the present methods (and lack of them) by which young persons pass from school to employment.

A study of the lignin sulphonic acids obtained from soft and from hard woods has been undertaken, in this investigation, in order to compare the chemical structure of the two classes of lignin.

The work discussed herewith was begun in 1933 as a continuation ot previous efforts of the Washington Experiment Station to improve chemical methods of codling moth control, and in addition, to alleviate the difficulty of removing spray residues at harvest. Most of the expertments were carried on at Wenatchee, Washington, but the analyses of materials as well as some of the arsenical deposit determinations were made at the main station at Pullman, Washington. Since the most significant outcome of this work has been the development of the inverted spray mixture, in principle an innovation for the insecticide field, it appears to merit considerable discussion. The account which follows, therefore, in addition to a brief review of the literature concerning the materials in question, presents in some detail certain of the methods and results of the Wenatchee investigations. Because of the immediate need for practical information on the part of the Washington apple industry, it has not been possible to devote sufficient time to the laboratory part of the work. Some of the experiments could well bear repetition, and repetition might alter present concepts. [...]</description><creator>Marshall, James.</creator><contributor>Brittain, W.

Again, the modern form of democracy grew up with capitalism. For the era of the Industrial Revolution was also the period of political revolutions, both on the continent and in the New World, which undermined despotic forms of rule and proclaimed in the words of Rousseau that "" the real sovereign is the people and law is the expression of the general will" While Voltaire, Rousseau,Hume and Montesquieu were propounding the doctrines of the new rational philosophy, and of governmental reform, Smith,Turgot and Hamilton were presenting to the world the new science of political economy.

They also knew that the addition of lime to an acid soil corrected the acid condition. It was not, however, until science with its nutrient culture experiments secured a foothold that the problems of acid and alkaline soils were put on a firm basis; and as a result, suitable explanations for many of the difficulties were presented. According to Wherry (58) the first paper dealing with the relationship of soil reaction and plant distribution appeared in 1916. It is very interesting to follow the relative importance that has been given to soil acidity as a factor influencing plant distribution and growth since that time.

The capitalist in his attempt to cut down expenses often arouses the enmity of labor, sometimes rightly, sometimes wrongly. Labor in its attempt to obtain what it considers fair wages, hours, and living conditions must necessarily organize. Separately, like a twig the workingman is weak, but collectively, like the bunch of sticks, labor can not easily be broken. The present great depression has hastened the growth of the Committee on Industrial Organization, commonly called the C.I.O. Briefly the C.I.O. is a labor organization, seeking to insure a better deal for labor through a policy of collective bargaining with the employer. It is an all inclusive organization with members from light and heavy industry, crafts and trades, all under the capable leadership of John L. Lewis. It is the purpose of this paper to present an impatial study of the Committee on Industrial Organization, its benefits to labor, and its effects on industry and government. Before presenting such a study, however, it is best to turn back briefly to the beginnings of organized labor in the United States, and thus obtain a background for the birth and growth of the C.I.O.

Hence many apparently characteristic signs of hypophyseal deficiency are in reality due to secondary degeneration of dependent glands, particularly the thyroid and adrenal cortex. As a result of tbe rapid advance in our knowledge of the trophic hormones of the anterior lobe of the pituitary, we are now able to identify, with some degree of certainty, some cardinal signs of hypophyseal deficiency. These are in general more obvious within a few days after hypophysectomy, in contra-distinction to the secondary symptoms which may take as long as three weeks to become fully established, owing to the slow regression in the activity of the dependent gland. The primary signs of pituitary deficiency are also often recognizable by their unique characteristics, not simulated by a deficiency of any other hormone.

The three Foucauldian approaches constitute three original ways for the study of the environment: an archaeology of the natural sciences, agenealogy of social practices and strategic ethics. To illustrate the appropriateness of a Foucauldian approach to the environment, we develop a genealogy of environmental policies in the Canadian context between 1966 and 1990. We notice the emergence of an environmental governmentality characterised by bureaucratic centralisation, and then, starting in the mid-1980s, decentralisation of the effects of power to the whole social body. This Foucauldian approach reveals the mechanisms of the social construction of an environmental subject.</description><description>Les théories de Michel Foucault et celles concernant l'environnement ont proliféré depuis une vingtaine d'année.

Les trois approches foucaltiennes constituent trois façons originales d'étudier l'environnement: une archéologie des sciences naturelles, une généalogie des pratiques sociales et une éthique stratégique. Afin d'illustrer les possibilités d'une approche foucaltienne à l'environnement, nous prenons le Canada entre 1966 et 1990 comme étude de cas et choisissons l'approche foucaltienne la plus prometteuse, c'est-à-dire une généalogie des politiques environnementales. Nous observerons la mise en place d'une gouvernementalité environnementale caractérisée d'abord par une centralisation bureaucratique, puis à partir du milieu des années 1980, d'une décentralisation des effets de pouvoir dans l'ensemble du corps social. Cette approche foucaltienne permet de révéler les mécanismes de la construction sociale d'un sujet environnemental.</description><creator>Darier, Éric.</creator><contributor>Tully, J.

We call these two forms regular. All the 1ntegers not represented by a regular form f coincide with all the positive integers given by certain arithmetical progressions. This is Dickson's definition of a regular form.

The effect of these substances on the luteal phase of the human menstrual cycle has been investigated by estimation of their effect on the pregnanediol output in 24-hour volumes of urine. The estimation of pregnanediol was done by the technique of Venning as published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 119, July, 1937. The cases investigated will be discussed at a later date. The gonadotropic hormone was in the form of antex, (follicle-stimulating factor from mares' serum) phyeex (luteinizing factor from human pregnancy urine). Oestrin was in the fora of oestradiol benzoate or (progynon B) 10,000 i.u. As this thesis is concerned with the effect of the injection of various sex hormones on the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and the resulting pregnanediol excretion, it would seem in order to discuss briefly the ovarian hormones and describe the physiology of menstruation.

[...] At the beginning of the Great War it was generally believed, as the result of animal experiments, that the state of surgical shock was due to a deficiency of the fluid contents in circulating blood. Greatly increased interest was aroused in this condition as a result of the War. On the battlefields shock occurred on an enormous scale, especially when wounds were caused by fragments of shell, bombs and grenades. [...] In most of the treatises on shock a large amount of space has been devoted to the theories of shock which various investigators have enunciated and supported by argument and experiment. However, in spite of the large amount of attention it has received, it has remained an enigma. [...] Exposure to cold, traumatic injuries, excessive muscular exercise, spinal shock, acute infection and intoxication with various drugs will evoke this syndrome if they damage the organism sufficiently. This reaction has been termed the "General Adaptation Reaction," and is divided into three different stages, which are - the "stage of alarm", the "stage of resistance" and the "stage of exhaustion." In the pages to follow the "adaptation reaction" and its three divisions will be discussed in detail. [...]</description><creator>Harlow, Charles M.</creator><contributor>Selye, H.

This family of compounds embraces all those molecules which contain a ring built up of four carbon atoms and a nitrogen atom. The presence of this ring has been established in a series of important vegetable bases, which had previously been regarded solely as derivatives of the six-membered ring pyridine; namely nicotine, hygrine, cuskhygrine, atropine, hyoscyamine, cocaine, tropacocaine, and others. Further, the reduced pyrrole derivative proline (pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid) is a hydrolytic product of nearly all proteins. [...] The above examples provide sufficient illustration of the importance of pyrrole derivatives. Pyrrole itself, the parent substance of this class, is found in coal-tar and bone-tar, and is also present among the distillation products of bituminous shale. [...] Pyrrole is a colorless liquid which turns brown on exposure to the air and smells somewhat like chloroform. It boils at 130° to 131°C under 761 mm. and has a specific gravity of 0.9752 at 12.5°C. It is miscible with most organic liquids, but is only slightly soluble in water. The formula for pyrrole would suggest that it is a secondary base, but its basic properties are extremely weak. [...]</description><creator>Guest, Gordon Hamilton.</creator><contributor>McFarlane, W.

The resulting products have become more satisfactory in every respect as many of the detrimental characteristics have been brought under control and taken care of by changes in the welding details or in the design of the parts. However, it is upon these characteristics that continued study must be made with the object in view of formulating practical procedures to overcome them. Since there are so many variables in the problem and so much depending upon the personal element with regard to the welder, it will be only by well planned and continued research and strict qualification tests that reasonable agreement between the designed and resulting product will be obtained. When all is said and done the joints are the elements of a structure which require most consideration and all types of joints (weld, rivet, etc.) are limited by certain properties of which mere mention of some is included: 1. Stress concentration due to shape of the joint; 2. Shrinkage stresses arising from the joining process; 3. Heterogeneity of structure and composition of plate and added metal (Weld, rivet, etc.) in the joint. 4. Workmanship.

This has been on account of the increasing commercial importance of a few such compounds in the manufacture of synthetic rubbers and similar polymers, and the utilization of by-products of the petroleum and coal-tar industries. In this way much information about the properties and reactions of 1,3-butadiene, isoprene, chloroprene, 2,3-dimethylbutadiene-1,3 and 1,4-diphenylbutadiene-1,3 has been accumulated. The subject of this thesis, 2,3-diphenylbutadiene-1,3, has not been studied to any great extent; but, before dealing with this compound in detail, the general reactions of the conjugated dienes will be considered. While some of these hydrocarbons, such as the terpenes ocimene and myrcene, [...] and the carotenoid hydrocarbons occur in nature, and while several of the simpler members can be prepared by the pyrolysis of oils and petroleum, most members of this group must be prepared synthetically. The methods used are generally special cases of those elimination reactions used to prepare ethylenic compounds. A common method is to eliminate the elements of water from a suitable glycol or unsaturated alcohol. [...] This method of preparation is often the most convenient, as the starting materials are generally easy to synthesise. In many cases elimination can take place in more than one way and a mixture of isomers is obtained. [...]</description><creator>Eliot, Charles Graham.</creator><contributor>Stevens, P.

The specific factors studied were the effects of temperature, liquor composition and pretreatment of the wood sample on the rate of delignification. [...] Experimental methods were chosen so that as many of the variable factors as possible could be held constant, and one isolated variable studied at a time. [...] The experimental data has been presented chronologically and is divided into two, almost completely separate parts. The first deals with the effect of various types of pretreatment on subsequent delignification, and the second is concerned only with the effect of varying the liquor composition and the temperature, on the rate of delignification of untreated wood. There is a general section dealing with experimental methods common to the work as a whole, and in addition, specialized sections preceding each part. Because of the nature of the work, some discussion is given along with the experimental data. However, each section is concluded by a summary and a more general discussion. An attempt has been made throughout to distinguish clearly between any speculation and the actual experimental facts on which it is based.

The first is that the ability to produce such growths is present in a very wide variety of organisms. Malignant tumours are found in every class of vertebrates and in many invertebrates. The second is that although tumours are known to occur in many different groups, their frequency and kind in each of these is markedly different. The ability to form neoplasms is a probably universal characteristic of organized tissues, but some tissues and some genetic constitutions have greater tendencies towards tumour production than others. This difference in tendency is in itself evidence of an hereditary influence on tumour susceptibility. That such an influence does exist has been amply demonstrated in the case of a number of organisms. [...]</description><creator>Howard, Alma C.</creator><contributor>Huskins, C.
