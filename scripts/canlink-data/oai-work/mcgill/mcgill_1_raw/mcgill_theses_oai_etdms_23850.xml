An integral but often ignored part of the nationalistic alternative theatre movement, PWM has developed and supported the work of hundreds of English playwrights both within and outside of the Montreal area. This study examines the work of PWM in an historical context, and as revealed in the organization's records and in contemporary reports. The written documentation is supplemented by interviews with persons who have worked with PWM. A number of these have made important contributions to Canadian dramaturgy on a national scale.</description><creator>Curtis, Ron</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Playwrights Workshop Montreal -- History</subject><title>A history of Playwrights' Workshop Montreal, 1963-1988 /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5h73px18t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cj82k827k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bn999784v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:05:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Extrudate swell is an important phenomenon in polymer extrusion, affecting many polymer processes. The ability of predicting swell, using rheological properties of the resin, would help the design and operation of plastics processing equipment. Different techniques for predicting swell are reviewed. A computer program has been written to predict steady-state, isothermal extrudate swell in annular and circular dies. The equations of motion and continuity have been solved along with selected constitutive relations. Newtonian, power-law and the viscoelastic Maxwell and Giesekus rheological models were chosen. The Galerkin formulation of the Finite Element Method has been used to solve the system of differential equations. The predictions for Newtonian, power-law and Maxwell models have been verified with existing experimental or numerical results when available. The results for the swell of Maxwell and Giesekus fluids have been compared at the same levels of elasticity. The effects of inertia and gravity on extrudate position and swell have been studied. Different geometries of an annular die (converging, diverging) were also examined.</description><creator>Brousseau, Patrick</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><subject>Plastics Technology.</subject><subject>Applied Mechanics.</subject><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Numerical study of extrudate swell in circular and annular dies</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9c67wn98f.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bn999784v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cn69m5273</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:05:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>As the applications being modeled by discrete event simulation become more complex the resources required for these simulations become prohibitively large. Distributed simulation offers a promising solution to this problem, but creates a new set of issues and trade-offs. This thesis focuses on distributed simulation algorithms based on a conservative approach with clustered processes. A multiprocessor based, distributed simulation testbed PARADIS, has been designed and implemented on a hypercube iPSC/2. Using this testbed, the performance of the TNE/DLTNE algorithms is investigated. A distributed knot detection algorithm and a distributed artificial deadlock algorithm were developed in order to detect, respectively, inter-processor deadlocks and artificial blocking. The later algorithm avoids PARADIS having to call the knot detection algorithm too quickly. Empirical performance evaluation of PARADIS showed that a significant speedup over a serial simulation might be obtained. The experiments showed also that the number of processes that are assigned to a single processor and the lookahead play an important role in the speedup of the simulation.</description><creator>Boukerche, Azzedine</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>The performance of distributed simulation with clustered processes /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dr26xz44g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cn69m5273</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:00000114j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:05:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis presents the phenomenon of communal habitation--from a traditional scene to a contemporary vista--in terms of a historical progression. It exhibits a hypothesis that attempts to justify the reason behind the deterioration of identity, livability and of neighborliness in contemporary neighborhoods. Although this thesis, in accordance with some contemporary community planning theories, pronounces the relevancy and importance of physical as well as social planning, it articulates, in line with annals of contemporary urban history, their incompetency to constitute the virtues of a good living place. In other words, urbanization, according to this thesis, is neither a mere physical pattern exhibited by fellow architects and planners, nor a sole social model manifested by some social reformers. Rather, it is a communal art the beauty of which is adorned by dwellers' goodwill and their spirit--a spirit that consequentially achieves a pleasing physical milieu, and attains a pleasant social environment.</description><creator>Ali-Zadeh Rastan, Soheil</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Neighborhood</subject><title>The neighborhood : a progressive presentation from the traditional to contemporary</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128nf75x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/00000114j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hm50ts757</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:05:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The present study aims to understand the subject matter of the Shajarat al-Kawn.

MPASS consists of a questionnaire administered on a computer program. The questionnaire was designed to assist individuals to recognize perceived physical, social, and environmental barriers; to increase their awareness of the benefits of physical activity; and ultimately to increase their awareness of suitable physical activities which would thus be perceived as enjoyable. Forty female volunteers between the ages of 24 and 45 completed the MPASS Tour and subsequently the Evaluation Questionnaire. Results showed a positive response to the MPASS Tour. The participants generally enjoyed using the computer program and indicated that the MPASS Tour had increased their awareness of their attitudes, preferences, and goals related to physical activity. They also had an increased self-awareness of those barriers which had prevented them from maintaining regular physical activity in the past. To a lesser extent, the MPASS Tour increased their awareness of their personal fitness and sport skill levels.</description><creator>Finkelstein, Kathleen Standish</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Questionnaires -- Data processing</subject><subject>Physical education and training</subject><title>The development and evaluation of the McGill Physical Activity Selection Service System /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6108vc62z.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bn9997854</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physical Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1g05fc83z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:05:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study examines the influence of home, classroom and book-reading conditions on emergent and early readers' developing literacy abilities. The study, done with 60 grade 1 children from the inner-city and more affluent areas of Montreal uses complex multivariate designs to assess how these three conditions influence children's developing literacy abilities. Results indicate that variations in the home environment and children's interactions with print have a significant effect on book and code knowledge and print awareness before school instruction. The combined effect of the classroom and home environments have a significant influence on print awareness and reading fluency. After 4 months of instruction children improve significantly in book and code knowledge, print awareness, accuracy and fluency. Across classrooms, children differ in print awareness, fluency and word-reading accuracy. Assisted and unassisted reading conditions with an unfamiliar, patterned book indicate that use of strategies changes as a function of time and assistance given.</description><creator>Sollars, Valerie</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Literacy</subject><subject>Children -- Books and reading</subject><title>The influence of conditions of reading on early literacy development /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3r074w28b.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1g05fc83z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h415pb534</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:05:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Mitochondrial myopathies are a group of diverse neuromuscular disorders. Defects in electron transport chain (ETC) subunits have been implicated in pediatric and adult onset cases. Skin fibroblasts from four patients were studied to elucidate the biochemical defects. Cells from two patients with ETC complex I deficiency, showed reduced oxidation of alanine with normal oxidation of succinate. Analysis of complex I subunits indicated deficient synthesis of the 20 kDa subunit in the severely affected patient. In the milder patient, subunit abnormalities were not detected. Fibroblasts from a patient with facioscapulohumeral disease (FSHD), showed reduced oxidation of alanine and succinate through the ETC. A fourth patient, with decreased activity in several complexes in muscle and liver, was found to have a heteroplasmic mtDNA population in fibroblasts.

Incremental Modification of Hypothesis Fragments (IMHF) is a new algorithm for processing instances of concepts incrementally, discovering a consistent hypothesis after presentation of each example. A modular connectionist approach using the back-propagation learning algorithm was taken to implement the IMHF algorithm. A shell called Parallel Unconnected Neural Networks (PUNN) was developed to give back-propagation the additional power of modularity and provided for the needed complexity to model IMHF.

As the work progresses, this theme becomes omnipresent, in the narrator under the guise of a wish; this theme is travel. At first glance, it is the very movement of travelling (real and imaginary) which propels the text. Although all Proustian characters travel, the richness of this theme is most eloquently expressed in Marcel. For this character, travelling takes on many forms: dreamed, accomplished, and written; it becomes at once real and mythic. It has often been said that the Recherche told the story of a literary career. Given this, it seems that the search for writing is an integral part of this narrative of travel. Let us say that the very construction of the story, which is more related to the imaginary than to a real description of Venice, emphasizes the transition of reading to writing. It is this passage we wish to illustrate in this master's thesis; for Marcel, the act of reading is intimately connected to his desire of travel.</description><creator>Gaudreau, Marie-Josée</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Venice (Italy) -- In literature.</subject><subject>Proust, Marcel, 1871-1922 -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><subject>Travel in literature</subject><title>La Venise de Proust : le voyage comme élaboration du livre</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fx719n50v.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d504rm52k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3f462664c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:05:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of two types of videotape instructions on the resequencing performance of female tennis players at the novice, low, medium, and elite skill levels. Resequencing performance on the tennis serve and forehand drive was examined. Three different treatment conditions were administered: a control group was required to simply resequence the twelve still photographs of the tennis serve, another group were presented a videotape replay of the tennis serve played at regular speed, then three times in slow motion and then a final showing at regular speed, and a third group viewed a videotape replay augmented by skill cues. A posttest was administered. Similar procedures were carried out for the forehand drive. The results indicated that the resequencing performance was related to expertise in tennis. The slow motion and slow motion replay with augmented information treatments improved the resequencing performance of all the players on the tennis serve but not on the forehand drive.</description><creator>Gendron, Stanley C.

Scalar quantization is the first approach evaluated. Results show that Line Spectral Frequencies require significantly fewer bits than reflection coefficients for comparable performance. The second approach investigated is the use of vector-scalar quantization. In the first stage, vector quantization is performed. The second stage consists of a bank of scalar quantizers which code the vector errors between the original LPC coefficients and the components of the vector of the quantized coefficients. The approach is to couple the vector and scalar quantization stages. Every codebook vector is compared to the original LPC coefficient vector to produce error vectors. The second innovation into vector-scalar quantization is the incorporation of a small adaptive codebook to the large fixed codebook. Frame-to-frame correlation of the LPC coefficients is exploited at no extra cost in bits. The performance of the vector-scalar quantization using the two new techniques is better than that of the scalar coding techniques currently used in conventional LPC coders.</description><creator>Grass, John</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Quantization of predictor coefficients in speech coding</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/00000115t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/js956h147</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k35695584</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:05:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The thesis examines a select amount of poesie by the artist Jean Cocteau, and through interpretation, explores the architecture of his work. This process of interpretation poses two questions: What is the role of the architect today, compared with his role as understood throughout history? How does the production of architecture today reflect the mechanisms of capitalism with its division of knowledge and labour, compared with an architecture which is inclusive and reconciliatory? A clear message emerges from Cocteau's Poesie as a response to the two aspects of Orpheus: the first is represented by the processes of individual creativity, and the second by the collective realization of a project, whether it be a work of theatre, the production of a film, or the design and realization of a building.

The model used is a direct extension of the Pink model for the main transition of pure lipid bilayers. Cholesterol is introduced as a bulky, rigid molecule with no internal degrees of freedom. The model is able to account for the chain melting of lipid molecules, and is expected to be valid at low cholesterol concentrations. A minimal model for the transport of ions across membranes is used to predict the changes in the passive permeability of lipid-cholesterol bilayers for different cholesterol concentrations and different lipid chain lengths. The model assigns different probabilities of transfer to bulk, clusters and interfaces. The main assumption is that, defects due to bad packing at interfacial regions, cause the membrane to be leaky and allow the ions to permeate it. Therefore the model assigns a high probability of transfer to the interfacial regions. A peak in the permeability is observed near the transition temperature, which is in accord with experimental data. The results show an increase in the passive ion permeability for increasing cholesterol concentration for the three systems under consideration. Also, an increase in the membrane permeability is predicted for decreasing chain length for all the cholesterol concentrations studied.</description><creator>Corvera Poiré, Eugenia</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Physics, Molecular.</subject><subject>Biophysics, General.</subject><title>Permeability of lipid bilayers containing cholesterol</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2n49t319h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g732db06b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ng451j68v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:05:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is an architectural investigation of perception, depth and representation. It explores the changing historical relationship between "two-dimensional" representation and architecture in an effort to understand the effects of modern perspectival depth on the making of architecture. The non-perspectival, medieval representations studied in this paper, are not looked upon as primitive forerunners of renaissance perspective, but as being expressive of a completely different notion and location of depth. In an attempt to access this "other" depth, the move from nonperspectival to perspectival perception and representation is looked at in relation to the change in perceptual values, brought on by the move from the largely oral culture of the Middle Ages, to the increasing textual culture of Renaissance and Modern ages. Perhaps without the fixity, neutrality and disengagement inherent in both perspectival and textual perception, architectural depth might return to the active world of human experience.</description><creator>Fluck, Katherine</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Perspective</subject><subject>Architecture, Medieval</subject><subject>Architecture -- Composition, proportion, etc.</subject><title>Medieval topics : perception, rhetoric and representation in the Middle Ages</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hm50ts77s.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ng451j68v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1g05fc85h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:05:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Sentence processing strategies by 10 bilingual speakers (Spanish: L1 and English: L2) were compared to 10 monolingual speakers of Spanish and 10 of English. Word-by-word reading times for ambiguous and non-ambiguous sentences were recorded. A paraphrasing task was used to determine the attachment preferences for a prepositional phrase placed after the verb. Multivariate analyses of the data showed that bilingual speakers combined strategies from both languages when processing ambiguous sentences in L2 that are non-ambiguous in L1. Furthermore, overall results showed that the three groups were sensitive to the attachment of the prepositional phrase.

Those novels were published in the midst of a debate on a possible reform of the educational system of Quebec. This debate is summarized in the introduction. The author's critiques can be divided into three main themes: the deficiencies of the school system, the difficult teachers' condition and the questioning of the authorities. It will be shown, in the conclusion, that the question of education is one of the main elements in a vast project of social criticism formed by the three novels.</description><creator>Forest, Michel</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Bessette, Gérard.

The structures, primarily of the form A$ ell$-Bi-Se-metal were fabricated by depositing thin films of the elements involved with evaporation techniques. All the diodes prepared showed rectification, which was strongest for the T$ ell$ samples and weakest for the Pt samples. Measurements made on the diodes included current-voltage, as well as, capacitance and resistance as a function of bias and frequency. In addition, preliminary photoelectric measurements were carried out for the first time on the Se-metal devices to determine the Schottky barrier heights. At low frequencies, an anomalous non-Faraday inductive effect was observed in many of the samples and in Se-T$ ell$ devices in particular. In these samples, the effect appeared to be correlated to the presence of the semiconducting compound SeT$ ell$, which was detected by x-ray diffraction in the samples after several days of storage. With Pt counterelectrode samples, inverse rectification was observed, due possibly to the formation of an ohmic counterelectrode contact but a rectifying back contact. From current versus voltage and capacitance versus voltage measurements, it was found that, despite the presence of interface states, the Schottky barrier heights determined for freshly made samples decreased with increase of metal work function.</description><creator>Clark, William Robert</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Electrical measurements of thallium, bismuth and platinum contacts to sellenium</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ng451j70w.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hq37vp71n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g158bj341</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:05:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>An outbreak of pulmonary tuberculosis in a Canadian Native Indian family was analyzed. Of 66 evaluated subjects, 52 (79%) became newly-infected, twenty-four (46%) of which developed disease. Chest radiography was the single best diagnostic test (sensitivity 92%; specificity 100%), after which neither demographic variables nor skin test reactivity detected additional disease in a multivariate discriminant analysis. Without radiography, tuberculin skin test reactivity and the subject's age together were significant but poor predictors of disease (model sensitivity 74% and specificity 64%). All diseased adults, but only 46% of children, produced culture-positive specimens (p = 0.006). Therefore, children with suspected disease should be treated, regardless of culture results. No linkage was found between HLA type and disease occurrence in any model. Higher lod scores were obtained by reclassifying subjects' phenotypes, but linkage was excluded up to a recombination fraction of 0.20. Neither HLA class I loci nor a closely-linked recessive susceptibility locus is a major factor in tuberculosis disease development in this Canadian Indian family.</description><creator>Miller, Mark A.

A brief chapter introduces the reader to Boiotia, the setting, which gives the relevant background to later developments. In chapter II, it is argued that Boiotia participated rather extensively in emigration during the Dark Age, leaving the homeland, with the exception of a few refuge settlements, somewhat denuded of its previous population. The following chapter not only builds on this latter point archaeologically but also looks at the development of settlement, focusing primarily on the fact that settlement, and presumably population, grew steadily in Boiotia until well into the Classical period. The final chapter is divided into two parts; it first examines the secure cases of Boiotian colonisation and then the doubtful or possible instances. After considering possible socio-political factors, the discussion is taken in another direction. The search for metals is suggested, and the study ends with a plea for a systematic study of whether land-shortage was really as paramount a cause of Greek colonisation as presently believed.</description><creator>De Angelis, Franco</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Voiōtia (Greece) -- Colonization</subject><subject>Voiōtia (Greece) -- Population</subject><title>Boiotia in the geometric and archaic periods : population, settlement, and colonisation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zk51vh804.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8p58pf126</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Classics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z029p5767</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:05:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Three experiments were carried out to evaluate the applicability of the intensive management system to barley production in Quebec. In the first experiment, the effects of three levels of nitrogen fertilizer and ethephon (Cerone) on the performance of cultivars were tested. The aim of the second experiment was to test the effects of fungicide application and row width. In the third experiment, conventional and intensive management techniques were tested on three soil types. High levels of nitrogen increased the grain protein content and thus improved the feed quality of spring barley. Application of ethephon reduced plant height but also reduced the number of grains per head. A fungicide by row width interaction resulted in a reduced seed size and weight in the narrow rows. The effects of intensive management on yield were inconsistent and were influenced to a large extent by the prevailing weather and soil conditions.</description><creator>Maloba, Elizabeth Wanga</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Barley -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Barley -- Yields.</subject><title>A study of some aspects of intensive management of spring barley in south western Quebec /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s4655h808.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z029p5767</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Plant Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9c67wp02t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:05:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Electric field levels between 30 and 1000 MHz were predicted using a free space propagation model, and then measured in three major hospitals in downtown Montreal. The measurements were performed using industry-standard techniques and new broadband, omnidirectional, triaxial, electrically small (BOTES) techniques. Although the absolute values of predictions were often unreliable, they acceptably predicted the type of electromagnetic environment actually observed at different hospitals. Results from both sets of measurements were closely related, suggesting continued future development of lower-cost BOTES measurement techniques. None of the fields encountered were above the limit prescribed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) susceptibility standard for medical devices. Correlations of survey results and of previous reports of device malfunctions in the rooms surveyed suggest that compliance with the FDA standard should be mandatory rather than voluntary. Results obtained by industry-standard techniques were used to simulate the effect of measured electromagnetic environments on typical biomedical equipment, and the simulations show that disruptions of the normal operation of medical devices are to be expected.</description><creator>Boisvert, Philippe</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>The ambient electromagnetic environment in metropolitan hospitals /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8p58pf13g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9c67wp02t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4f16c393g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:05:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The lectins Ulex europaeus 1 (UEA 1), Ricinus communis 1 (RCA 1), Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA), and Lens culinaris agglutinin (LCA) which are specific for L-fucose, D-galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, and D-mannose respectively, have been used to localize cytochemically the presence of these sugar residues in certain human, mammalian, and amphibian cell types. Thin sections of Lowicryl K4M-embedded human distal colon, rat duodenum, and frog dorsal root ganglion were incubated with UEA 1-gold, RCA 1-gold, WGA/ovomucoid-gold, or LCA-gold. UEA-1, RCA-1, and LCA binding sites were present in the nuclei of human colonic cells, rat duodenal goblet and columnar cells and frog dorsal root ganglion neurons, satellite cells, and Schwann cells. Most of the nuclear binding sites were localized in the euchromatin compartment, while extranuclear labelling was largely restricted to sites known to contain glycoproteins. WGA binding sites were present in the nuclei of rat duodenum columnar cells and frog dorsal root ganglion neurons, satellite cells, and Schwann cells, but no labelling of human colonic cell nuclei was observed. Thus, we report the presence of these sugars in the nuceloplasm of human colonic cells (with the exception of WGA), rat duodenal villous columnar cells, and frog dorsal root ganglion cells examined.</description><creator>Paniccia, Rocco</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Biology, Anatomy.</subject><title>Detection of nucleoplasmic glycoconjugates using lectin cytochemistry</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9z903112p.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4f16c393g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anatomy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vt150k37g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:05:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The primitive New Zealand frog Leiopelma hochstetteri shows exceptional karyotypic variation. On the North Island, females carry univalent W chromosome and both sexes have 0 to 15 supernumerary chromosomes. Frogs from Great Barrier Island have a conventional 2n = 22 karyotype, with no sex chromosome differentiation in C-banded mitotic chromosomes. However, the lampbrush chromosomes of a Great Barrier Island female show evidence of heterogamety. This suggests that presumed ancestral female heterogamety has persisted on Great Barrier Island and given rise to a WZZ-female/ZZ-male sex chromosome system on the North Island. A repeated sequence, Lh1, varies greatly within populations in copy number and distribution on genomic EcoRI fragments. In situ hybridization revealed the variable presence of large Lh1 arrays on supernumerary chromosomes and two autosomes. The extensive Lh1 variability implies that, like the supernumeraries, it is more selfish than functional in the L. hochstetteri genome.</description><creator>Zeyl, Clifford</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Leiopelmatidae -- Evolution.</subject><subject>Leiopelmatidae -- Genetics.</subject><title>Genome evolution in the primitive frog Leipelma hochstetteri</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h989r424d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vt150k37g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hq37vp72x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:05:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We consider various properties of the general three-way layout in experimental design, and begin with the information or C-matrices that play a key role, particularly with row-column and two-way elimination of heterogeneity designs.
