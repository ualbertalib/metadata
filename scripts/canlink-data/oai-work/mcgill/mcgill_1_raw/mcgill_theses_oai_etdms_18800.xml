S. Lashley (1929) introduced two important concepts into the body of theories of brain action. They were "equipotentiality" and "mass action." Both concepts were supported by impressive experimental evidence; a number of further studies have tended to confirm them (these will be summarized later), and both terms are firmly established in the literature. Nonetheless, this state of affairs has not been entirely satisfactory. It is difficult to reconcile mass action and equipotentiality with the results of many studies on animals higher than the rat.</description><creator>Smith, Charles. J.</creator><contributor>Hebb, D.

There are no coal deposits in the Province, oil has not, as yet, been found, and natural gas has appeared only in limited quantities; therefore, water power, the white coal, must be relied upon to supply the power required for industrial development. Electric power output is often considered an index of industrial growth. In 1900, prior to the inception of long-distance transmission of electricity, Canada's economic basis was agriculture, and the total hydraulic installation was about 173,000 horse power.</description><creator>Sinclair, Martin.

The possible importance of other stimuli in the organism's environment has been neglected, or such stimuli have been considered important only as possible “distractions”, likely to disorganise behavior and reduce efficiency.</description><creator>Scott, Thomas.

Or, "histochemistry deals with the chemical characterization of substances in their natural locations within cells and tissues." These definitions furnish the introductory statement to two excellent reviews on the subject by Gersh (1941) and Dempsey and Wislocki (1946). Histochemistry is a relatively young science. As evidence for this, one may cite the very recent publication of the first textbook of Histochemistry (Pearse, A.G.E.: Histochemistry, Little, Brown and Co., Boston, 1953), and the establishment of the first journal devoted to publications within this field (Journal of Histochemistry and Cytochemistry, The Histochemical Society, 1953).</description><creator>Ravaris, Charles.

After a traditional Islamic education, Zahawi fell under the influence of Western philosophy and science and became a free thinker, as well as cm ardent liberal and social reformer. He played a certain part in politics and in the Arab national movement both before and after the 1914-1918 war, but the importance of his work lay in the realm, not of politics, but of ideas.</description><creator>Qaysi, Abdul.

The assumption of winter dress by some mammals and of breeding dress by some fishes are familiar example of the former. The colour changes of the chameleon illustrate the redistribution phenomenon. Mere distribution of pigment itself may come about in several ways. It may result from the response of contractile tissue or from those of pigmentary effector organs.</description><creator>Purvis, John. L.</creator><contributor>Denstedt, O.

This is not the place to enter into the fascinating subject of its history; therefore let us immediately embark on our attempt to show in what direction the likelihoods point. In balancing the positive and negative aspects of the strictly literary-historical evidence against each other we soon come to the conclusion that this evidence overwhelmingly ascribes the play to Shakespeare.</description><creator>Puhvel, Martin.</creator><contributor>Duthie, G.

Excluded from this study, for similar reasons partially, are the courses in manual training, industrial arts, and domestic science, which are often given in elementary and secondary schools; moreover, a study of these courses has already been made by Orville White, in The History of the Practical Education Courses in Canadian Secondary Schools, McGill University Thesis, April, 1951.</description><creator>Price, John.

Accordingly, attention has been directed not only to those crops which can be used as an immediate source or food but also to those which only serve to provide fodder for domestic animals. Red clover is a plant of the latter type. The intermediate climatic zones of the Eurasian and North American continents constitute the main areas of distribution of red clover. </description><creator>Povilaitis, Bronys.</creator><contributor>Boyes, J.

To the best of my knowledge this theme has never before been treated on the scale of a book. J. Canning's work, The Economies of Accountancy, deals with the topic, but his is a static approach; he interprets accounting classifications economically. On the other hand, while Kenneth Boulding's latest book, A Reconstruction of Economics, is dynamic, using the balance sheet in all phases of economic analysis instead of merely in Money and Banking as heretofore, the emphasis is upon economic analysis.</description><creator>Potter, Calvin.

These included both laboratory and field studies but covered a relatively small number of species of the bursate nematode group. In the laboratory the worms were usually subjected to various artificially imposed conditions and then were compared in their reactions and appearance to nematodes kept under natural conditions.</description><creator>Poole, John.
