It includes most of Lanark and part of Leeds counties. Within the county of Lanark there are parts of the townships of Dalhousie, Drummond, Montague, Bathurst, North Elmsley, South Sherbrooke and the entire township of North Burgess. The county of Leeds includes parts of the townships of North Crosby, South Burgess, South Elmsley, Bastard and Kitley. The largest towns in the map-area are: Perth, the county town of Lanark, which is in the central part of the area and has a population of 4,500, and Smiths Falls which is on the eastern edge of the map-area and has a population of 8,500. Perth was founded in 1816 by Scottish soldiers disbanded after the war of 1812 and was for a long time a military town. Highway No. 15 from Ottawa and Highway No. 7 from Toronto join at Perth, which is at 50 miles from Ottawa. Highway No. 29 from Brockville and Highway No. 15 from Kingston cross the southeastern part of the map-area. A network of secondary roads provides easy access to all parts of the map-area and allowed detailed mapping to be made in a few months. Lot fences also form a good grid for surveying. The map-area can also be reached by railroad, the Canadian Pacific line from Montreal to Toronto going through Perth and Smiths Falls. Other railroads connect Smiths Falls with Brockville, Kingston, Carleton Place and Ottawa. [...]</description><creator>Dugas, Jean.</creator><contributor>Clark, T.

The measured dosage rate was 6.1 ± 2.7 x 10^5 rep/second. Irradiation times varied from one to eight minutes. Fragments of gram molecular weight estimated at 1000 were round in sedimentation experiments on serum albumin irradiated with 7.3 x 10^7 rep. These fragments did not absorb at 2920 Å. It was concluded that molecules of serum albumin in which a single primary ionization occurs are broken preferentially at one point to give fragments of this size. Sedimentation experiments on haemoglobin irradiated with dosages of protons up to 3 x 10^8 rep showed that little fragmentation had occurred. For serum albumin, the ultra-violet absorption at 2576 Å and 2920 Å increased by a factor of three after a primary ionisation had occurred in 93% of the irradiated molecules. The absorption of haemoglobin at the same wavelengths increased by 50%. These changes were attributed to a shift in the maximum absorption band towards the visible end of the spectrum. At 3906 A the absorption of haemoglobin decreased by 50%.</description><creator>Eadie, Frank Stewart.</creator><contributor>Foster, J.

Studies on the part played by wood-boring insects in the deterioration of the standing, burned timber were initiated the following year. Most of the damage to the firekilled trees was found to be caused by two cerambycids, Monochamus notatus (Drury) and M. scutellatus (Say). The biology of these beetles is discussed by Craighead (1923, 1950). The two species are commonly separated on the basis of colour (Knull, 1946). M. notatus is dark brown with lighter brown elytra and is covered by a greyish-white pubescence, while M. scutellatus is usually a shining black (Plate 9). The scutellum of each bears a dense, white pubescence which, in M. notatus, is divided by a bare, median line. Such a line also occurs in M. scutellatus but it is usually incomplete. The elytra of the females are generally marked by elongate spots. Length is also used to separate the two species. For example, Chagnon (1938?) gives the range of length for M. notatus as 27-32 mm. and that for M. scutellatus as 19-24 mm. Actually, no such clear-cut difference in size ranges occurs; instead, a very considerable overlap is found in the field. It was also apparent in the field that the two species acted almost as one population. Both caused the same type of damage, and bred freely in the same locality at the same time and in the same host trees.

These simple steps, or elementary reactions, generally involve free atoms or radicals. The existence of free radicals was first demonstrated by Gomberg (1) in 1900 in his classical identification of the triphenylmethyl radical in solutions of hexaphenylethane. In 1925, Taylor (2) suggested that simple radicals auch as the etbyl radical, C2H5, could be responsible for the observed high yields of ethane when ethylene and hydrogen mixtures were caused to react by mercury-photosensitization. It was first shown by Paneth and Hofeditz (3) that free radicals could be detected by their reaction with a metallic mirror deposited on the walls of a tube through which a carrier gas, together with the radicals, was flowing. The half-life ot the methyl radicals was shown to be about 0.006 sec., a value which was considered to be quite appreciable for a free radical. Rice and co-workers (4) soon obtained evidence to indicate that such free radicals were found during the thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons, and suggested that the majority of organic substances decomposed by a free radical mechanism. However it was still necassary to account for the fact that most organic decomposition reactions followed a first-order rate law, and that the experimental activation energies were usually smaller than the strength [...]</description><creator>Gesser, Hyman.</creator><contributor>Winkler, C.

The present project is actually an outgrowth of a previous investigation whose purpose was to determine whether Listeria monocytegenes, or any part thereof, could stimulate the production of sheep erythrocyte agglutinine in rabbits. This initial study has already been reported on (Girard, 1950) and the whole problem has been extensively reviewed by us as a result of this study (Girard and Murray, 1951), reprints of which are submitted. Work was already underway to attempt the isolation of a monocyte-producingagent (MPA) by ourselves in this department from the lipid constituants of the organism, L. monocytogenes, in the Fall of 1949, when an article by N.F. Stanley (1949) appeared that described the isolation thereof. Using his technique we successfully extracted the biologically active material which would, upon intravenous inoculation into rabbits, produce a rapid, marked increase in the number of circulating monocytes (Girard, 1950). Our extraction, however, was made with Listeria monocytogenes 10 XXVIII from Professer E.G.D. Murray’s collection. Upon the receipt of the Australian strain some weeks later and the examination thereof, similar results were obtained, though the Australian variety seemed to be more biologically potent in this respect.[...]</description><creator>Girard, Kenneth F.</creator><contributor>Murray, E.

Feldberg in 1942, as did other early workers, confirmed the synthesis of acetylcholine in tissue slices and in the cellular debris of homogenates; the enzyme involved apparently remained fixed to the tissue or debris and was not obtained in solution. The enzyme, “choline acetylase”, was first obtained as a “cell-free” extract from rat brain and electric organ (Electriphorous electricus) homogenates by Nachmansohn and Machado (1943). “Choline acetylase” was extracted from peripheral nerve (Nachmansohn and John, 1945) and more recently in a highly active form from squid head ganglia homogenates and dried preparations (Nachmansohn and Weiss, 1948). Nachmansohn and his co-workers (1945b, 1946) concluded that the enzyme is present in all nerve tissue free of cell bodies and nerve endings, i.e., is present in motor and sensory nerves as well as in the optic nerve. Feldberg and Mann (1946) consider it to be absent from non-cholinergie nerve (3) fibres, i.e. from the posterior roots and the optic nerve. “Choline acetylase” has been demonstrated in heart auricular tissue (Bülbring and Burn, 1949) and in striated muscle (Nachmansohn, Barman and Weiss, 1947).

The method followed was to assemble all published information relating to acid volcanics; to plot on maps such data as can be shown graphically and to summarize the rest.

Frequency conversion is the term now given to the process of combining two frequencies, the signal and local oscillator frequencies, to produce a third called the intermediate frequency. It is a process of modulation that was originally called heterodyne detection and later first detection. If one tube combines the function of oscillator and modulator, then that tube may be logically termed a converter. If, however, separate tubes or other devices are used for the oscillator and modulator portions of the converter, the latter tube or device is called a modulator or mixer.

There is ample historical evidence to indicate that knowledge of its fundamental principle - the strong cooling effect exerted during the evaporation of a liquid - was already possessed by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks, who applied it to make small quantities of ice (206, 246). Modern mechanioal refrigeration dates back to Dr. William Cullen (225), who in 1755, contrived an apparatus tor cooling water by evaporation, equipped with a suction pump to discharge the water vapor into the atmosphere. Although some improvements were introduoed by Nairn in 1777, it was not until 1805 that Evans suggested a closed cycle, thereby conceiving the idea of the compression system. Experimental work by Sir John Les1ie, carried out around 1810, marks the beginning or the absorption refrigeration cycle. He used water as a refrigerant and accelerated the removal of the vapor by employing sulphuric acid along with reduced pressure. A sulphuric acid machine, working on this principle, was invented by John Vallance in 1824. The compression system was first proposed by Hagen in 1834. Jacob Perkins patented that same year a unit using ether as a refrigerant and based on the Evans closed cycle. This was the first power driven compressor and included the four principal parts of the conventional system - compressor, condenser, expansion valve and evaporator.

Many methods are known to industry for its isolation and purification. This alkaloid finds use in medicine as one of a group of spasmolytic drugs with a paralyzing action on the smooth muscles of the intestines and blood vessels. However, in common with other pharmacologically useful alkaloids derived from the opium poppy, the availability of natural papaverine is ltmited by the stringent international controls on the cultivation of this plant. While several methods have been developed for the synthesis of papaverine, up to this decade, it was doubtful if they could compete economically with even the small yield extracted from natural sources. German research carried out during the last war, and brougnt to light in very recent B.I.O.S. reports, now indicates that synthetic papaverine may compete with, and even displace, the natural product. It seems reasonably certain that any economically successful synthesis of papaverine must employ vanillin as a principal reactant. Althougn vanillin could now be obtained in almost unltmited amounts and at reasonable cost from the waste liquors of the sulfite pulping of softwoods, its production has hitherto been limited by the lack or adequate commercial uses. The present research had the object of exploring still further the possibility of utilizing vanillin for the synthesis of papaverine.

However, relatively little work has been done on the diffusion of polymers, with the result that the experimental information about polylmer diffusion lags behind the theoretical treatments available. Some attention has been given to the problem in this laboratory during the past few years, and the present thesis represents a continuation of the effort to provide a more adequate experimental background. There have been several theoretical treatments of polymer diffusion, all but one of which regard the solvent as a continuous medium, and a polymer molecule to move as a unit. In the exceptional theory, the solvent is regarded as containing holes, and the polymer chain as moving by coordinated motion of its many segments from one hole to the next. The various theories must first be outlined briefly as a basis for understanding the experimental work to be discussed later.[...]</description><creator>Hiltz, Arnold Aubrey.</creator><contributor>Winkler.

Sulfonamide therapy was started immediately; all animals, healthy or sick, receiving one-half grain per pound body weight of sulfamethazine every day in their drinking water. Sera, to be used as complement for the serological laboratory, was always obtained from large healthy guinea pigs. During the pneumococcal outbreak, greater care than ever was taken to see that only healthy animals were used, but in spite of the precautions taken, it soon became evident that the complement was unsatisfactory. In the light of this, it was suggested that an investigation into complement activity during sulfonamide therapy would be of value.</description><creator>Johnston, Constance Anne.</creator><contributor>Kalz, G.

Howerver, it is becoming recognized more and more as a behaviour disorder arising from a personality abnormality.  Disorders of personality arise, to a very large extent, from unsatisfactory relationships within the family such as subjecting the child, during the early period of his development, to unwholesome and adverse parental attitudes, to unusual forutnes and to seduction by adults and older children.  Children within the school may also cause the child to truant.  He may be bored with a stereotyped school routine or find the curriculum, with its accent on verbal learning, discouraging.  He may interpret the teacher’s impatience as a personal affront.  From situations such as these, a child often chooses turancy as an escape.  In a community lacking in recreational facilities, a child may seek outlets for his excess energy in unhealthy ways.  In the community, too, he may suffer from discrimination on social or religious grounds.  If the frustration arising from such conditions is carried over into the classroom, he may react by truanting.  The Community Service Society of New York concludes that, “...truancy is found in conjunction with a complicated set of difficulties....(it is) a response to a general disturbance of the personality and the environment. As a result, children have not been able to adjust in the school setting.” [...]</description><creator>Johnston, Robert S.</creator><date>1952</date><subject>Social Work.</subject><title>Truancy in children referred to a child guidance clinic.</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0c483n47m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/70795c02w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zk51vm209</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T18:15:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Using white rats, a feeding trial in which levels of fat and of mineral (bone char) supplement were varied showed apparent digestion coefficients of better than 92% for bydrogenated peanut oil or m.p. 42°C.

By obtaining resonance-curves of a high-Q resonant cavity at 270 mc/s measurements have been made of the dielectric constant and loss tangent of dry air and three dry non-polar gases. The loss tangent of each of the gases at N. T. P. is shown to be less than 5 x 10-6. Preliminary similar measurements on dry air have been made at 2970 mc/s.

During the next 18 years, the most eminent mathematicians and physicists contributed lively discussions to account for the reception of signals. Finally, the idea that radio waves could be guided along the surface of the earth, much as electromagnetic energy can be conducted along wires, was examined theoretically and experimentally. Shortly after the feasibility of transmitting electromagnetic waves for commercial services became apparent, engineers undertook a large number of carefully conducted experiments to determine the value of signal strength under a given set of conditions. Thus, in 1930, considerable knowledge had been obtained concerning the behaviour of propagation in the radio spectrum, up to frequencies of about 30 megacycles. Until such time, it was felt that propagation of higher frequencies was not practical since it displayed very poor characteristics. A few years later, when electronic components became more efficient and commercial services required more space in the radio spectrum, the frequencies above 30 megacycles were investigated more seriously. It was then found (1,2,3,4) that at these very high frequencies, the relation of the wavelength to the size of material objects was such that many aspects of the theory of propagation [...]</description><creator>Kelton, Michel Robert.</creator><contributor>Howes, F.

During the past 25 years, the Diesel engine has been found to be both mechanically and economically superior to many of the other types ot combustion engines, both internal and external, commonly used in heavy-duty haulage trucks and locomotives, and hence, at the present time its use in these fields has become very extensive. However, in underground haulage operations, the use of Diesel engines has been severely curtailed, chiefly because of the problems presented by the noisome and noxious gases that issue from the engines as exhaust. Other difficulties, such as the fire hazards presented by the storage of large quantities of fuel oil or by the possible ignition of gaseous combustible materials, such as methane or coal gas, in contaot with the hot engine or its exhaust, have also placed great restrictions on the use of Diesels underground. But the toxicity of the exhaust gases still remains the most pertinent reason inhibiting widespread adoption of Diesel powered locomotives in mines on this continent. The hazards presented by the use of Diesel engines in mines and tunnels have been investigated extensively in Europe (21,30,66), and later, in America (3,7,8,30,39). As a result of these investigations, considerable research has been carried out in an attampt to eliminate these hazards.

This pest is of particular economic importance in Essex County, Ontario, where cucumber culture under glass is a major commercial practice. Each year mite infestations result in a ten to fifteen per cent loss of a $3,000,000 crop. The recently developed aerosols of parathion and related phosphoric acid esters have been highly effective against active forms but have had little or no ovicidal effect. Such controls are costly as they must be repeated at intervals of time to prevent further mite population build-up from the unaffected eggs. The most effective of these chemical controls have on occasion resulted in the selecting out of resistant strains of the pest, thus defeating their own effectiveness. Many workers have, therefore, turned their attention to the investigation of non-chemical methods of controlling these mites on greenhouse plants. One suggestion has been that controls might be effected by the manipulation of plant nutrients in the soil (Page, 1946; Rodriguez and Neiswander, 1949). This led the writer to undertake a controlled nutritional experiment at the Dominion Entomological Laboratory, Harrow, Ontario, in an attempt to ascertain the effect of various levels of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium on the fecundity of the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus bimaculatus Harvey.

For sheep, the index was useful only if the ration contained 35%, by weight, of a ground non-roughage material. Limitations were pointed out in the regression method of determining indirectly the digestibility and metabolizable energy of sheep and pig feeds. Associative digestibility complicated these determinations. It was also emphasized that relatively large amounts of supplement must be added to a basal ration to obtain reliable digestion coefficients for the former. In calculating the physiological fuel values of a feed for sheep, need was indicated for a specifie determination of the urinary and gaseous energy lasses. Following a change in sheep or pig ration composition, a length of time, considerably longer than the usual preliminary feeding periods used for these species, was required before digestibility became constant and maximum.</description><creator>Lloyd, L.

The observed deviations have been attributed to the sizes and shapes of the polymer configurations. An aliphatic hydrocarbon of low molecular weight can adopt many different configurations, depending upon the number of degrees of freedom. The possibility of these different configurations is due to the existence of more or less free rotation about the carbon-carbon bonds. When the number of carbon atoms is increased the number of possible configurations becom.es larger. When a long chain hydrocarbon, auch as polyisobutylene is dissolved in a solvent of low molecular weight, each macromolecule, as a result of Brownian movement of the surrounding solvent, can undergo coiling and unooiling to an extent whioh depends upon the interaction between the polymer and solvent, the temperature and concentration. Because of this irregular coiling and uncoiling of a long chain polymer, the extent of which depends on its inherent flexibility and enviromnent, the shape of a single macromolecule is essentially an instantaneous characteristic. However, by observing the macromolecule for a sufficiently long time, it is possible to consider an “average shape” and to discuss a change of shape as it refera to increase or decrease in the average extent of coiling.

Since its introduction as an insecticide, DDT bas become very well known as a pest control in various parts of the world. The popularity ot DDT was greatly enhanced by the demands of the armed forces during the second World war. The introduction ot DDT resulted in a large number of studies on the toxicity of this insecticide to animals as well as to insects. Despite many intensified studies on the toxicity of DDT, its fate in the insect body has never been completely described. Several theories have been proposed to explain the mode of action of DDT in the insect. Most of these theories have been contradicted and none have been entirely satisfactory. Early workers attributed the toxiciy of DDT to certain structural groups in the molecule. Recent workers consider the size and shape of the molecule more important. An intensive study of the action of DDT on insects bas been undertaken by the Entomology Department at Macdonald College. It vas decided to use C14 labeled DDT in the following studies:- (a) Penetration of DDT into the integuement of the insect, (b) Translocation of DDT in the insect body, (c) Determination of the organs affected by the insecticide. With this end in mind radioactive DDT was prepared. The active molecule contained C14 at the point of attachment of the two p-chlorophenyl rings.
