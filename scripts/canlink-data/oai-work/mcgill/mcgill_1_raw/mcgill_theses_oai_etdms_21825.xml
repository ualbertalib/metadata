A survey of dextrous hand systems and their related technologies is also provided. As part of an effort to characterize the UMDH system as a whole, a nonlinear mathematical model of the actuator is given including detailed representation of the jet pipe element, orifice areas and fluid dynamics. Model parameters are identified and the model formulation is validated through experimentation and simulation. The performance of the actuator under closed-loop control is examined. Experimental results show that feedforward control is useful in eliminating any steady-state offset and that a stable bandwidth of 80 Hz is achievable using a simple proportional feedback controller. A linearized model of the actuator is presented and compared with the nonlinear model. Results show that linearized model adequately describes the actuator dynamics at the specified operating point. The agreement between simulations and experimental data indicates that the mathematical models presented are potentially valuable tools, whether to aid in the analysis and design of actuation systems, or for use in model-based control.</description><creator>Henri, Paul D.</creator><contributor>Hollerbach, John M.

Iron removal is carried out in the jarosite conversion circuit which consists of ten continuous stirred tank reactors in series. In this study, the first five tanks of the jarosite conversion circuit were piloted and process identification experiments were carried out. Step changes in the flows of the raw acid, spent acid, jarosite slurry and zinc ferrite slurry streams were performed. The goal of these experiments was to collect transient response data which could be used to validate a dynamic conversion circuit model. The process was found to be most sensitive to changes in the flow of the raw acid stream. The zinc ferrite dissolution rate constant calculated from the experimental data agrees with literature values. Using a jarosite precipitation rate expression from the literature, it was found that jarosite precipitation is negligible in the first reactor but cannot be ignored in the second tank. The dynamic model provides a good representation of the first two tanks of the jarosite conversion circuit and can be used for both process control and optimization studies on a full-scale facility.</description><creator>Holcroft, Gillian L.

Parallel processing systems are introduced and analysed for this application. A parallel microcomputer system is used and a new method of direct kinematics for displacement analysis is implemented. The selected microcomputer system is integrated in an IBM 286 compatible personal computer. Finally, a parallel software program is implemented, which allows for efficient control of three actuators driving the three degree of freedom planar manipulator. Hence, introducing a new processing method for the control of this manipulator.</description><creator>Helmy, Ahmed</creator><contributor>Vrooman, J. L.

PA activity (change in absorbance/h/mg wet tissue weight, three gilts per treatment group) was elevated in both granulosa cells (GC) and theca interna cells (TIC) prior to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration (0.582 $ pm$ 0.171 and 0.718 $ pm$ 0.221, respectively) but returned to basal levels in these two compartments (0.023 $ pm$ 0.013 and 0.052 $ pm$ 0.024, respectively) at 29 h post-hCG. PA activity remained basal thereafter in GC but increased approximately ten-fold in the TIC (0.549 $ pm$ 0.239) at the time of ovulation (three gilts at 41 h and one of three gilts at 38 h). PAI activity did not change in TIC over the pre-ovulatory period but increased in GC as ovulation approached. PAI activity in GC peaked at 38 h (being significantly different (p $&lt;$ 0.05) to all other times except 41 h). Although indomethacin (INDO) effectively inhibited both PG synthesis (1.1 $ pm$ 0.2 vs. 9.2 $ pm$ 0.9 ng/ml in controls) and ovulation (0 vs. 27-61% in controls), elevated PA activity (0.801 and 0.349) was detected in the TIC of two out of nine INDO-treated gilts. Levels were basal (0.074 $ pm$ 0.028) in the other gilts. These inconclusive results are believed to reflect the occurrence of ovulation earlier than predicted, in as many as 40% of control gilts, and the short duration of increased PA activity at this time. In conclusion, elevated PA activity, in GC and TIC prior to ovulation induction, may play a role in follicular development. Elevated TIC PA activity may play an important role in the ovulatory process, but is probably PG-independent.</description><creator>Grant, Gerald F.</creator><contributor>Downey, B. R.

The ultimate goals of software reuse are: to improve the quality of software produced; reduce the costs of software development; and increase the productivity of software developers. However, the present situation, and the concern amongst researchers, is that software reuse is not living up to its original expectations (FBPD$ sp+$91). Although there have not been very many scientific studies that validate the claim, it is nonetheless a strongly held belief among researchers and developers that object-oriented software offers great potential in terms of software reuse (Mey88). Much as object-oriented programming allows for the creation of more reusable components, it is the reuse of the design of an application that is most promising for attaining the goals of reusability. For this reason, our work concentrates on application frameworks, an important object-oriented technique to facilitate design-level reuse. We have spent the last year developing a fairly large object-oriented application called Macrotec, using an application framework called ET++ (WGM89). Through-out this paper, we will refer to our experience, and in-experience, in working with application frameworks. In particular, we will introduce the different levels of reuse we have identified when developing from application frameworks. We address the present lack of adequate design representations by introducing a new technique for the representations of abstract designs. Also, a new approach to documenting application frameworks is presented, complementing the proposed representation of abstract designs. We strongly believe that application frameworks have the potential of drastically improving the current reuse crisis. We sincerely hope that our work will become a first step in solving the current lack of knowledge in how to use and reuse application frameworks effectively.</description><creator>Lajoie, Richard</creator><contributor>Keller, Rudolf (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Madhauji, Nazim (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Using, reusing and describing object-oriented frameworks</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bc386k070.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pg15bf812</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nv935383z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:52:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Since glucose is the principal substrate used during exercise and is also the main metabolic fuel for the developing embryo and fetus, exercising during pregnancy could induce a competition for fuel between fetus and exercising muscles, perturbing glucose homeostasis. To determine if exercise during pregnancy would predispose the fetus to increased risk, pregnant rats were randomly assigned to a low (4%), moderate (12%) or high (60%) carbohydrate diet, and either rested or exercised on a rodent treadmill at a moderate (15.5 m/min) or high (24.3 m/min) intensity from day 16-21 of gestation. When food intake was controlled for in the statistical model as a covariate, the level of maternal dietary carbohydrate significantly influenced maternal liver weight, heart glycogen, insulin, amniotic fluid glucose and lactate, but not maternal plasma glucose, liver or skeletal muscle glycogens. In contrast, a restricted level of maternal dietary carbohydrate, lowered fetal weight as well as fetal plasma glucose, insulin and liver glycogen. Exercise intensity significantly altered only maternal lactate levels. The results indicate that acute exercise during pregnancy can have detrimental effects on fetal development only if carbohydrate energy is restricted. Otherwise, adequate carbohydrate in the maternal diet appears to protect the fetus.</description><creator>Cobrin, Mona</creator><contributor>Koski, Kristine (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Pregnancy -- Nutritional aspects.</subject><subject>Rats -- Reproduction.</subject><subject>Exercise.</subject><title>The interaction of the level of dietary carbohydrate and exercise intensity during pregnancy on fetal growth and development /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n296wz854.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nv935383z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:b2773w46p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:52:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A comparison of the CDF (Collider Detector at Fermilab) central calorimeter electron response between 1991 test beam electron data and the CDF full detector simulation, using six variables that are used to identify electrons in CDF, is performed.

In its uncomplicated form, this anemia is due primarily to reduced production of erythropoietin (EPO) by the diseased kidney. The present study was carried out in order to determine the relative role in the anemia secondary to CRF of EPO and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a recently recognized important regulatory factor of erythropoiesis in the normal physiological state. A mouse model of CRF was employed in this investigation. Six weeks after the surgical induction of renal failure, the mice were characterized in terms of biochemical and hematological parameters which included the response to a 3-week treatment with recombinant human EPO (r-HuEPO). Additionally the kidneys, liver and bone marrow were harvested for the determination of the mRNA expression of EPO and IGF-1 as assessed by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction followed by Southern blotting. Normal mice and mice rendered anemic by phlebotomy were included in all experiments.

These signals can be classified by their solubility properties. Hydrophilic signals, in the form of peptides or small hydrophilic molecules, interact with extracellular receptors located on the surface of target cells. Binding of ligand to its receptor leads to transduction of an intracellular signal via a second messenger. Lipophilic signals (steroids, vitamin D$ sb3$, thyroid hormone, and retinoids) traverse the plasma membrane and bind to specific intracellular proteins, known collectively as nuclear receptors, rendering them active. These ligand-receptor complexes then regulate the transcription of target genes. In this thesis, transcriptional regulation by two different systems has been studied. First, recent evidence suggests that expression of the parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) gene is sensitive to elevated levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Second, vitamin D$ sb3$ is activated in the kidney by hydroxylation and functions by diffusing across the plasma membrane of target cells and binding the vitamin D$ sb3$ receptor (VDR).

Sixty-four daughters and sons of parents in three long-term care facilities completed interviews and questionnaires. Events related to the parents' behaviour and cognitive status were more frequently appraised by their children as stressful and were appraised as more stressful than those related to assisting parents with activities of daily living or to events associated with the long-term care facility itself. Characteristics of the parent were more significantly related to the appraisal of caregiving events as stressful than were those of the adult child or the caregiving situation. In general, adult children were most confident in managing the stress associated with assisting their parents with activities of daily living and least confident in dealing with the stress related to interactions between their parents and the staff and between themselves and the staff.

This study was initiated during the development of native fisheries in northern Quebec. Coregonine populations from 6 lakes of the Nottaway watershed were sampled to determine infection patterns of T. crassus in relation to age and size of fish, and to document interlake differences in prevalence and number of T. crassus. Interspecific and interlake differences in the infection dynamics of T. crassus were described in relation to capsule types, sizes and plerocercoid conditions. Infection dynamics were also investigated with age of fish. All coregonine populations were infected with T. crassus, and cisco more so than lake whitefish where the two species co-occurred. Prevalence and number of T. crassus were independent of fish age and size in most lake whitefish populations. Number of T. crassus increased with fish age and size in all cisco populations, but prevalence increased only in the populations from the largest lakes. Interlake differences in prevalence and number of T. crassus were detected for both coregonine species, and were related to feeding behaviour of the fish and lake biophysical characteristics. Heavy infections in one lake whitefish population were mainly associated with piscivory. Interspecific and interlake differences in the infection dynamics of T. crassus were also observed. Differences in the proportions of capsule types, sizes, and plerocercoid conditions suggest that population turnover of T. crassus in cisco is faster than in lake whitefish.

Controversy exists on whether glucose or lipid is the optimal source of non-protein energy. A randomized clinical trial was conducted for one week to compare the effects of TPN providing 34% of non-protein energy as lipid (Group 1; n = 7) to those of hypertonic glucose TPN (Group 2; n = 6). Indices of nitrogen retention, metabolic abnormalities, physiologic stress, and fat clearance were measured. The energy and protein intakes of Group 1 exceeded those of Group 2 from days 0 to 7 (p $&lt;$ 0.05). Nitrogen balance improved significantly in both groups (p $&lt;$ 0.005). Group 1 achieved zero nitrogen balance within two days; Group 2 never achieved net positive nitrogen balance. Significant elevations in insulin levels (p $&lt;$ 0.025) were associated with both TPN admixtures. However, between the two groups the changes in nitrogen balance, albumin, glucose, fructosamine, insulin, liver enzymes, bilirubin, cortisol, and free fatty acid levels were not statistically different. It would appear that the lipid-carbohydrate TPN is more beneficial for patients who require TPN for a short period of time, but due to the small sample size and short study period further research is recommended.</description><creator>Aguzzi, Anna</creator><contributor>McArdle, A.

The rain spectra are broadened and shifted on the velocity axis due to turbulent air motions. Information in the clear air mode is used to correct for these effects, leaving in the rain spectra the reflectivity-weighted distribution of drop fall speed, from which the drop-size distribution can be computed. The fast Fourier transform and two iterative methods of deconvolution were applied to simulated Doppler spectra. We concluded that the iterative methods of deconvolution are more appropriate than the fast Fourier transform. Of the two iterative methods, Jansson's method of deconvolution, including prefiltering of the data, was found to give better results than Van Cittert's method. Jansson's method was applied to biomodal spectra obtained from the HARP project of 1990 in Hawaii and to spectra obtained from a similar radar operated in Montreal. Evident is the different characteristics of rainfall in both regions and the appropriateness of the same deconvolution method to different classes of spectra.</description><creator>Boodoo, Sudesh</creator><contributor>Rogers, R.

The purpose of this is to integrate object-oriented concepts into the relational model. RELIX is a database progamming system based on the relational model. Inheritance and nesting are two important features which are desirable to have in a database. Therefore, our aim was to incorporate these features in RELIX. The implementation was done using RELIX's existing relational functionality, without any modification. Inheritance and nesting were implemented using the natural join, showing that they could be implemented using relational operations. New syntax was added to RELIX to enable the user to take advantage of inheritance and nesting, thus giving the programmer an object-oriented view on a relational database. We also took advantage of the dependence of inheritance and nesting on the natural join, and implemented an alternative algorithm for it based on the concept of a join index. This algorithm improves the performance of natural joins for low activity operations such as those associated with inheritance and nesting.</description><creator>Baroody, Ramzi</creator><contributor>Merrett, Tim H.

A preponderance of heritability (h$ sp2)$ and genetic (r$ rm sb g)$ experiments are performed under laboratory conditions which are characterized by low levels of environmental variability. This thesis describes the investigation of the effects of environmental heterogeneity on phenotypic components of variance and covariance. Full-sib families of the field cricket, Gryllus pennsylvanicus, were split between a homogeneous laboratory environment and a more variable field environment. The values of h$ sp2$ were, on average, lower in the variable field environment, with a mean reduction of 19%. Development time was an exception, exhibiting high levels of additive variance in the field. Substantial decreases in generic components of variance contributed to the lower field h$ sp2$ estimates, as well as the expected increases in the components of environmental variance. Within-environment r$ rm sb g$ among morphological traits were not found to differ between the two environments. Laboratory measures of r$ rm sb g$ involving life history traits, though, were not found to reflect the same correlations measured in the heterogeneous environment. A significant negative genetic correlation between fecundity and development time was found in the field environment, yet was not observed in the laboratory. Male-female genetic correlations between morphological traits were high (all r$ rm sb g&gt;0.73),$ and were consistently higher in the field environment than in the laboratory. The genetic correlations between the sexes in development time followed the same trend, but gonad weight showed no similarity between the sexes in either environment. Across-environment correlations within each trait are also discussed.</description><creator>Simons, Andrew M. (Andrew Michael)</creator><contributor>Roff, D. A.

Merr.) yield in acid soils in many developing countries is the purchasability of liming materials. For many low income farmers, liming to the 'ideal' soil pH of 6.5 using conventional methods is usually too expensive. Pot and field studies were conducted to determine whether satisfactory soybean growth could be obtained by reducing the amount of lime applied and the volume of soil limed. The Quebec soils used in these studies were a Gray-brown Luvisol (pH 5.1) and a Humic Gleysol (pH 5.3) in the pot study and a Gray-brown Luvisol (pH 5.1) and a Dark-gray Gleysol (pH 6.1) in the field study. Results suggest that localizing the lime in acid Quebec soils would be a more efficient use of the liming material. Further studies in tropical acid soils are required to determine if the localized placement of lime is a viable practice for third-world, low income farmers.

D. Hibler (1979) was applied to the Lancaster Sound/Barrow Strait channel in an effort to simulate the observed ice environment. The simulation covered a ten month period, from October 1985 until August 1986. The impact of atmospheric and oceanographic forcing on the development of characteristic ice features that develop seasonally within the channel was examined. The importance of the ice interaction component of the model when simulating a restricted channel ice environment was also examined. The model was able to simulate regional scale processes and conditions within the channel. Small scale localised processes and conditions which control the spatial variability and complexity of the ice regime were not accurately reproduced. Simulation results provided insights into the effect and importance of both the model and geophysical variables examined. The study highlighted concerns that need be addressed in future modelling work in the Lancaster Sound/Barrow Strait channel.</description><creator>Heacock, Tony</creator><contributor>Lewis, J.

Total aggression rate per fish and the proportion of long chases decreased in larger groups and increased during short periods in which food was unavailable. The proportional use of the area near the food source was maximal at intermediate group sizes suggesting that use of the feeding area was reduced by aggressive defense at low densities and by passive interference at high densities. Air-breathing frequency tended to be lower when food was available than when it was not, suggesting that gouramis reduce their use of atmospheric oxygen when it may result in loss of food to competitors.

The procedure in all 3 experiments involved assessing conditioned responding to a Light that was compounded with either perfect or imperfect auditory signals for food. In Experiment 1 a partially reinforced Light which signaled 100% of the food pellets acquired a greater ability to elicit a conditioned response when the auditory cues with which it was paired were relatively poor predictors of the food. In Experiment 2 the Light was still a moderate positive predictor for food, but food was presented both in the presence and absence of the Light. Responding to the Light again was reliably higher when the auditory cues were poor predictors of food. Experiment 3 replicated the results from Experiment 2 and included two control conditions to assess sensitivity to the absolute validity of the Light. In both control conditions the Light was uncorrelated with the US. In one condition the number of food presentations was the same as in the experimental condition, while in the second the number of Light-food pairings was maintained. Results suggested that regardless of the absolute contingency of the Light responding was higher when the auditory cues were uncorrelated with food. These findings suggest that associative models of cue competition make accurate predictions of conditioned behavior following exposure to multiple predictors of reinforcement.</description><creator>Murphy, Robin A.

The transposition of observations to literary images is subject to cultural and personal constraints that the present thesis aims at deciphering and analysing. We have entitled Informational intent the first section of our research, in which we have discovered that intelligible descriptions tend to the fragmentation and the categorization of the middle eastern woman. This approach has led us to find that the authors' perceptions are often limited to appearances. Moreover, our literary analysis have confirmed that the representations follow the laws and patterns established by centuries of oriental studies. The second section, entitled The narrative organization shows that the episodes where women are involved have been organized into quasi-autonomous narrative entities reflecting the rhythm of the travel. On the other hand, the autobiographical expression serves as a unifying element. In the last section, The woman as part of a global interpretation of the Middle East, we have realized that her representations are influenced by the attitudes and cultural context of the time as well as the specific poetic world of the authors.</description><creator>Der Kaloustian, Léna</creator><contributor>Pascal, Gabrielle (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Asians in literature</subject><subject>Women in literature</subject><title>La femme orientale dans deux récits de voyage de Nerval et de Flaubert /</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zk51vh562.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fb494935f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8k71nh88t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:52:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis traces the history and development of Ms. magazine, in its three incarnations, between 1972 and 1992. Since its inception as a distinctly feminist monthly, Ms. has drifted between two categories of popular cultural artifacts (mainstream consumer culture and feminist counterculture) while distingishing itself as the only national feminist monthly in the United States, a key economic and symbolic feminist institution. The author compares the economic bases, ideological orientations and readerships of Ms. three incarnations in order to examine and the ways in which an ideological vehicle negotiates a consumer setting like the women's magazine industry. While serving to highlight debates surrounding the limitations of liberal feminist ideology, the history and development of Ms. magazine also raises questions concerning the validity of categories like "mainstream consumer culture/feminist counterculture" where contemporary women's media are concerned.</description><creator>Clark, Caroline</creator><contributor>Robinson, Gertrude J.

The radioligands ($ sp3$H) DHA and ($ sp3$H) YOH were used to identify $ beta$- and $ alpha sb2$-adrenoceptors respectively. The determination of receptor criteria indicated that the optimal protein concentration for the simultaneous binding of both receptor types was between 0.35 and 1.0 mg/ml. Pharmacological specificity for both $ beta$- and $ alpha sb2$-adrenoceptors was demonstrated using receptor specific antagonists and an agonist. Saturation isotherms indicated that ($ sp3$H) DHA and ($ sp3$H) YOH labelled with high affinity, a homogenous population of non interacting $ beta$- and $ alpha sb2$-binding sites respectively. Scatchard analysis of the saturation data for ($ sp3$H) DHA revealed a Kd value of 8.1 nM and a Bmax value of 420 fmol/mg protein, while ($ sp3$H) YOH binding had a Kd value of 7.0 nM and a Bmax value of 68 fmol/mg protein. The variation in $ beta$- and $ alpha sb2$-adrenoceptor binding parameters was then investigated on the abdominal fat pad adipocytes of male and female broiler chickens at 4, 6 and 9 weeks of age. Scatchard analysis of the binding data for $ beta$-adrenoceptors indicated that Bmax values were greater in male and female broilers at 9 weeks of age (p $&lt;$ 0.05) and that overall Bmax values were greater in females than in males (p $&lt;$ 0.05). Scatchard analysis of $ alpha sb2$-adrenoceptor binding revealed that in females Bmax values remained constant but differed at all ages in males. The $ beta$-adrenoceptor Bmax values were always significantly greater (p $&lt;$ 0.05) than the corresponding $ alpha sb2$-adrenoceptor Bmax values. These results established for the first time the existence of adrenergic receptors on broiler chicken adipocytes using a radioreceptor binding assay. Although the physiological implication of these receptors is not known, it is a critical step toward the understanding of the influence of the adrenergic system on adipose tissue metabolism in avian species.</description><creator>Desjardins, Paule</creator><contributor>Lague, Paul C.

The herbicides under investigation were prometryn on an organic soil, and metolachlor on a sandy soil. Both soil and groundwater were collected and analyzed. The results presented are those obtained in the first two years of the project. In the organic soil, herbicide leaching was greatly reduced due to the management of the water table. The pesticide remained higher in the soil profile, preventing leaching to the drains and allowing degradation. The opposite effect appeared to have occurred in the sandy soil. The higher water table resulting from subsurface irrigation may have induced the leaching of the contaminant into lower soil levels and into the ground water.
