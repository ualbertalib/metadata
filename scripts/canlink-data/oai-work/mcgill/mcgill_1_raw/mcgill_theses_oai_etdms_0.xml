The objective is to build and demonstrate a representative subset of an electro-optical "Intelligent Optical Backplane" system capable of handling terabit data rates. This thesis describes the construction and demonstration of a prototyping printed circuit board (PCB) known as the ATMCard. The goal of the ATMCard is two-fold. The first is to develop an electronic PCB supporting ATM switching which can be connected to the 1998 CITR optical backplane demonstrator with minimal adjustments. The second goal is to serve as an initial step towards the specification and development of a more advanced electronic PCB designed for an optical backplane capable of supporting a bandwidth on the order of 10 Gbit/s. ATMCard functions include the extraction of ATM cells from SONET frames, ATM cell header translation, cell queueing, access to the CITR optical backplane, and the extraction of ATM cells from the backplane. The ATMCard is also a reconfigurable and reusable hardware prototyping platform, enabling rapid testing and verification of digital systems. The first objective of this thesis, the successful demonstration of an operational ATMCard which can be connected with minimal adjustments to the 1998 CITR demonstrator, has been achieved. Furthermore, the detailed descriptions of the ATMCard design and implementation included in this thesis provide the framework for the construction and demonstration of more advanced second generation boards. Thus, the second objective of this thesis has also been achieved.</description><creator>Kim, Michael C.</creator><contributor>Szymanski, T. H.

Presently, the borehole technique is used to evaluate the orientation of the cracks and the mechanical properties of the concrete. High costs are associated to this method as well as the need to extrapolate results between adjacent boreholes. Nondestructive testing is seen as a possible solution for reducing high inspections costs and increase the precision of crack location. This thesis presents the theoretical and practical aspects of a nondestructive method called the Miniature Seismic Reflection (MSR Impact-Echo) system. The system can evaluate a crack profile and determine the quality of concrete from one test surface. The objective of the research is to extend the capabilities of the system to crack detection in large scale concrete structures. Results are presented with respect to inclined crack detection, the minimum crack thickness detectable, and tests performed on a section of a concrete gravity dam. The experiments are part of a long term research project between McGill University and the "Institut de Recherche en Electricite d'Hydro-Quebec (IREQ)".</description><creator>Guevremont, Philippe.</creator><contributor>Hassani, F.

This last development has been mainly due to recent significant advances made in underground communications technologies. A new robotic mining environment is being created that will see mobile machinery as well as stationary equipment fully integrated with a mine-wide information system overseeing all aspects of the mining operation via a high-bandwidth communications network. Teleoperation of multiple semi-automated machines by one operator from a remote site (control room on surface) forms the basis of current efforts in underground hard-rock mine automation. This thesis attempts to outline the state of teleoperated mining systems in use today and highlights some of the key issues encountered when introducing this new technology into actual production settings. An actual case study on teleoperated uphole Data Solo drills at Inco Limited's Stobie Mine in Sudbury, Ontario, is used to demonstrate these issues during the various phases of project implementation.</description><creator>Golde, Peter V.</creator><contributor>Scoble, Malcolm (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Engineering, Mining.</subject><title>Implementation of drill teleoperation in mine automation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h702q826p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2514nn343</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ks65hf13t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T20:59:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Due to advances in computing technologies, the field of Virtual Reality is undergoing an intense developmental stage, with numerous applications being developed in various fields. These applications are diverse, ranging from architectural walk-throughs and virtual manufacturing environments to the entertainment industry and legal police investigations. One very active research area within the field of virtual reality is that of human figure modeling, design, and articulation. With virtual environments becoming more elaborate and involved, there is an increasing need for synthetic human models to act as "inhabitants" of such worlds, and to further contribute to the level of realism and immersion in the virtual world. This thesis describes the design and implementation of a synthetic human model to be incorporated into a virtual reality training system. The human model represents the persona of the user in a virtual world, embodied in the form of an articulated human figure, that is capable of autonomously enacting task simulations, as well as mimicking the user's maneuvers in real-time. The realism of the human model was further enriched with audio cues, and the model itself was augmented with a voice interface for vocal control.</description><creator>Faraj, Mazen.</creator><contributor>Malowany, Alfred (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Design and implementation of a human model for virtual reality applications</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1v53k0025.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hf13t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:v118rg44w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T20:59:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This report studies variable-block size motion estimation in time-varying imagery. An image can be partitioned into variable-size blocks where one vector represents the motion of each sample point within a block. The goal is to reduce the number of displacement vectors that can faithfully represent the motion field across an image. The approach builds on established gradient-based methods. The same concepts regarding the temporal consistency of the image information and spatial smoothness of the motion field are used to reach at an image partitioning algorithm and a corresponding formulation of the problem statement. Various aspects of the solution method are discussed. These include experimenting with an orientation specific smoothness term and optimization of the objective function.</description><creator>Fakhouri, Elie Michel.</creator><contributor>Dubois, Eric (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Variable block-size motion estimation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0v8382496.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v118rg44w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1z40kv82z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T20:59:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Strain and temperature gradients are developed through the cross-section during the hot rolling of steel rods. These gradients are of particular interest because of their potential effects on the homogeneity of the resulting microstructure during rolling as well as in the final product. Strain and temperature can strongly influence recrystallization and transformation behaviour. A three-dimensional, temperature-dependent viscoplastic finite element analysis was used to predict the strain distribution developed for the hot rolling of steel square billets using the software package ABAQUS/EXPLICIT$ sp{ rm TM}.$ Constitutive parameters were determined from previous experimental data generated at McGill University and at the Metals Technology Laboratory (MTL), CANMET. McGill-CANMET's Property Prediction Model was used to determine the microstructure during rolling and the final properties at room temperature. Results from the mechanical and microstructural models were validated with experimental data from literature and from rolling tests performed at MTL-CANMET. With these two models, several different hot rolling scenarios were generated to examine how the two models would predict their results by varying a single parameter.</description><creator>Chin, Brown.</creator><contributor>Yue, Steve (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</subject><title>Finite element analysis of the rolling of hot steel rods and its application to microstructural prediction</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/794080140.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1z40kv82z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p2676x67d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T20:59:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This is an investigation of the response of a double fixed-ended pultruded fiberglass tube subjected to large lateral displacements, in both quasi-static and dynamic conditions. The experiments yield a two-mode response of the tubing to loading. The first mode, referred to as the local mode, is dominated by crushing of the cross-section. The second mode, referred to as the global mode, consists of beam flexure and shear components. An analytical model, based on deformed geometry, has been developed to predict the response of the tubing under quasi-static loading conditions. Model results compare well with experiments and minimal computation time is required. Dynamic tests demonstrate a significant rate dependency, which is more pronounced in the globally-dominated portion of the behavior. The model has been used to demonstrate that steel tubing, commonly used as beams or energy absorbers, may successfully be replaced by fiberglass tubing produced by pultrusion or filament winding.</description><creator>Brunet, Louis, 1969-</creator><contributor>Nemes, James A.

The algorithm distinguishes itself from other similar, existing solutions in that it lends itself to a fast implementation, yet provides results which are reliable and accurate enough for use on a real mobile robot system without any a priori knowledge of the robot's egomotion. The algorithm builds on previous work by Frazier and Nevatia but adds two key enhancements in order to realize a working system. First is the ability to efficiently and continuously update the robot's egomotion parameters by way of the focus of expansion (FOE). This is accomplished by minimizing an objective function which computes the percentage of "apparently moving" edges in the dynamic map for various estimates of the FOE position. The search space of this objective function is significantly reduced by utilizing the notion of the Fuzzy FOE. Second is the inclusion of a maximum likelihood (ML) classifier to provide a means for automatic thresholding to differentiate between static and moving objects. Results for both simulated and real data are presented and indicate that algorithm is fast and reliable.</description><creator>Bhanji, Altaz.</creator><contributor>Levine, Martin D.

The code is capable of solving unsteady conduction. and convection-diffusion problems in two or three dimensions using cylindrical coordinates. The complex problem of the workpiece cooling, was decomposed into smaller sub-problems corresponding to the different cooling zones. For each sub-problem an inverse-problem approach was applied using data from cooling experiments as a reference. As the result, the heat transfer coefficients were determined for a workpiece cooling in air, including the effect of the chuck, and by impinging coolant jet. The latter is defined by a distribution function. The thermal field calculated using the heat transfer coefficients determined in this research was found to be in reasonable agreement with the thermal field obtained from experiments conducted during cutting.</description><creator>Arenson, Mordechai.</creator><contributor>Kops, L.

In this thesis, we examine the DCT-LMS algorithm and we emphasize on the role played by the Discrete Cosine Transform. This fixed transformation reduces the eigenvalue spread of the input autocorrelation matrix by partially decorrelating the inputs. The autocorrelation matrix of speech signals is often rank-deficient. During the low rank phases, some of the transform-domain tap coefficients become irrelevant to the adaptation process and stop adapting. When the autocorrelation matrix gains full rank, there will be no longer any "frozen" weights. However, the weights that have been frozen are "far" from the optimal point; they require additional convergence time to track again the changes in the room impulse response. In this dissertation, we present a new method that uses the information contained in the other coefficients to move the frozen weights closer to the optimal point and, consequently, reduce the overall convergence time.

Autonomous grasping requires continuous information gathering by sensors. In this thesis, I examined the use of miniature amplitude based infra-red proximity sensors which are useful in this context since they can be placed directly in the robot's end-effector and thus guarantee unobstructed sensing. Unfortunately, using these sensors in a network leads to problems of local interference. To eliminate such problems, I synchronized and modulated the frequency of commercial sensors to enable their use in a network. In addition, I have developed two approaches which provide useful tools for autonomous grasping of a planar object with known geometry and surface properties. The first approach utilizes a network of three sensors and an on-line extended Kalman filter to localize the object and estimate it's six states (two positions, one orientation and three velocities). The second approach is heuristic and uses four binary sensors to localize and grasp a stationary object without the need for scanning. Both approaches have been tested experimentally, and in each case the objective was successfully achieved.</description><creator>Abdul-Baki, Iyad.</creator><contributor>Buehler, Martin (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>A proximity sensor network for autonomous grasping /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pc289k943.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w0892c822</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6108vd447</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T20:59:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Debate has raged over terminating treatment for demented patients, those neither permanently unconscious nor terminally ill. Ronald Dworkin argues that the substituted judgment principle should be adhered to in making treatment decisions for demented patients, honoring the prior preference of even a "pleasantly senile" patient to reject treatment. Rebecca Dresser proposes adherence to a best interests standard focusing only on the current welfare of the patient, even if this would ignore her advance directive. Few courts have directly faced the issue: When should treatment of demented patients be terminated? No court has justified its decision on the ground that the family of the demented patient should have the preeminent role in decisionmaking for their loved ones. Courts purport to apply the substituted judgment standard, but reach inconsistent results. I argue that we need not choose between Dworkin's rigid adherence to a substituted judgment principle or Dresser's exclusive focus on the patient's current interests. I propose a new model: When a dilemma is in the moral "gray" zone--with no clearly right answer--the family decision should be granted presumptive validity so long as it is in the range of reasonable options.

Social scientists identify the CAP as a transitional situation in which people must learn to function simultaneously in different cultural systems, typically circumscribed into a dual categorization: 'the traditional' versus 'the modern'. Taking place between these two conditions, the CAP is influenced and constrained by socio-economic macrostructures and processes that define cultural change. This thesis explores rural migrants' CAP by analyzing the material culture of Chalco, a squatter settlement located in the outskirts of Mexico City. Self-help transformations of migrant housing produce a unique phenomenon. House forms and the selection of building materials, for instance, are defined not only by spatial or functional needs, but also by social priorities for adaptation. Preconceived aspects of housing evolution such as comfort or the reproduction of rural life are not necessarily priorities for migrants. On the contrary, the informants in Chalco favor the use of distinctive material signs that may help them to create their identity as urbanites. Hence, it is essential to view rural migrant housing as a physical expression of both residents' attempts to adapt to the urban culture (i.e., to participate in social mobility) and of the reproduction of social inequalities resulting from the nature of urbanization and development processes.

A large rural surplus labor force has transformed itself into irresistible migration waves sweeping across most of China's big cities. An essential question is how could Chinese cities avoid going through the same process of trial and error as other Third World cities, or what are the feasible ways to accept and integrate migrants within the existing urban systems. The answer to this question could only be explored to a large degree by examining the current situations in existing migrant communities. This thesis focuses on the study of the use of domestic space in migrant houses as a means to examine the question from an architectural perspective. A case study of Zhejiang Village, the most influential migrant community in Beijing has been conducted. From 30 survey samples, 15 are analyzed according to the range of economic activities pursued by the migrants. Two other samples from Zhejiang vernacular houses are also examined in order to conduct a comparative study. Detailed drawings and analysis are arranged to show how ingeniously they combine their businesses within their meager domestic space. The study shows that economic activities and cultural traditions are the vital factors that influence the use of domestic space in migrant houses. It also confirms that the physical integration of migrants must take into account their cultural background and spatial traditions.</description><creator>Liu, Xiaoli, 1964-</creator><contributor>Bhett, Vikram (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Housing -- China -- Beijing</subject><subject>Working class -- Dwellings -- China -- Beijing</subject><title>The use of domestic space in migrant houses : a case study of Zhejiang village in Beijing</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4t64gq249.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8910jw560</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:b8515q38p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T20:59:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Safety of a building's occupants is of primary concern in the design of a building. However, geophysical hazards such as earthquakes, still pose dangers to occupants of buildings. In an earthquake-resistant structure, even during a moderate shake, objects which are part of non-structural systems, accelerated by the sudden motion of the building, can hurt building occupants and cause damage to their property. The adoption of simple earthquake precautionary measures, could almost entirely eliminate this hazard. The adoption of these actions is the responsibility of occupants themselves, as part of their response to earthquake risk. Previous personal experience with earthquakes has been identified to be a major component of response to hazard risk. This response relates to the incorporation of earthquake risk into daily life, by the adoption of earthquake precautionary measures, which could make a substantial difference in reducing loss of life and damage to property during an earthquake. Therefore, the investigation of occupants living patterns in relation to earthquake safety gives an insight on their vulnerability and level of adoption of earthquake precautionary measures, particularly in a city constantly exposed to ground shakes such as Mexico City. This research project concentrates in the study of the internal layout characteristics of the dwellings in a social housing complex built after the 1985 Mexico City earthquake.</description><creator>Lara Navarro, Manuel Efrén.</creator><contributor>Bhatt, Vikram (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Earthquake resistant design -- Mexico -- Mexico City</subject><title>Earthquake precautionary measures in post-disaster housing with reference to Mexico City, Mexico</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qn59q612f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b8515q38p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9c67wp717</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T20:59:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis examines the construction practices in the traditional domestic architecture of Kerala in India. In doing so, it identifies two vital aspects of the architecture, namely the Vedic planning principles of the Vasthushasthra and the indigenous craft practices. The thesis pays tribute to both: the theories of Vasthushasthra in the construction of houses are examined in detail; the craft practices are documented and analyzed through a field study of 24 houses in Kerala selected across the caste, class and religious structures of the society. The thesis arrives at the proposition that the construction practices in the domestic architecture of Kerala, as evident in the case studies, are the result of a simultaneous presence of both these aspects. The Vedic principles were adapted to the contingencies of the context. The craft and techniques prevalent in Kerala at that time are part of a larger picture of cross-cultural transfer of techniques that occurred in the early historic times. Thus in Kerala, practice and theory worked together towards making a traditional domestic architecture that was meaningful and relevant in the socio-cultural, political and religious context at that time.</description><creator>Koduveliparambil, Jacob Joseph.</creator><contributor>Bhatt, Vikram C.

The Russian scholar Michail Lomonosov played a key role in the grammatical and lexical organization of the Russian literary language around the middle of the century. His contributions are reviewed and their importance analyzed in the present thesis. Chapter One provides an analysis of the linguistic situation during the first half of the XVIIIth century. The role and the functions of different linguistic elements are examined, including West European lexical borrowings, the native Russian, the Church Slavonic, and their mutual interactions. Chapters two and three analyze M. Lomonosov's role in the standardization of Russian grammar and vocabulary by examining his two major philological works: the "Rossiaeiskaeiia Grammatika" and the article "Predislovie o polbze knig tserkovnikh v rossiiskom yazike." Although Lomonosov's merit is widely acknowledged among scholars, the importance of his stylistic theory has been challenged lately. In Chapter Four, Lomonosov's linguistic contributions to the development of the modern Russian literary language are weighed and assessed against these critical arguments.</description><creator>Zingg, Olgica.</creator><contributor>Austin, Paul M.

An A-B design was used and participants included 5 boys (ages 7, 5, 6, 5, and 6) and their parents and teachers. Children evidenced improvements in target behaviour from baseline to treatment at home or at school (effect sizes = $-$6.48 to +1.77). Preliminary evidence was obtained indicating that treatment gains generalize to non treatment settings, however z scores were not significant. Overall, children's social skills increased, problem behaviour decreased, and internalizing difficulties decreased (Reliable Change Indices $-$4.71 to 4.75). In addition, preliminary evidence of the positive relationship between effect size and perceptions of goal attainment was obtained.

From April 1838 until February 1841, legislative power was vested in an appointed Special Council. This was a authoritarian institution, designed to facilitate the passage of a single legislative agenda, and not to act as a forum for debate. Even if the creation of the council marked a moment of imperial intervention, the changes imposed by the council were largely those envisioned by a Lower Canadian political movement, the Montreal Constitutional Association. As time went on, the Special Council's membership, powers and legislation increasingly reflected Constitutionalist values. However, not all Special Councillors shared the Constitutionalists' goals. Men like Pierre de Rocheblave and John Neilson consequently found themselves alienated from the council and its work. But those who opposed the Constitutionalists found themselves powerless to alter the course of events. In the end, the authoritarian nature of the Special Council meant that only one vision of the province's future could be put forward in the institution's legislation.</description><creator>Watt, Steven.</creator><contributor>Young, Brian (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Lower Canada.

There are many references to abl al-kitab in the Qur'an which may be grouped into two categories: the sympathetic verses which give ahl al-kitab a status similar to that of Muslims and the ambivalent verses which condemn the ahl al-kitab. In this study, surat Al 'Imran (3): 64, 113, 114 and 115 are chosen as examples of sympathetic verses. Six major works of selected classical and modern exegesis, from different schools of thought, are used in the analysis of these verses. Classical exegetes do not suggest any development of the concept of ahl al-kitab, while the modern exegetes include all religious communities in addition to Jews, Christians and Muslims. The Qur'an itself recognizes the existence of good people among the ahl al-kitab and invites people of diverse faiths to come to a "common word" (kalimatin sawa'in) to establish mutual understanding through critical dialogue. This would, in turn, enable all people to work together to build a new civilization and greater harmony. This thesis avails itself of the fundamental teachings of the Qur'an on ahl ak-kitab and of Muslims' exegesis, as well as secondary scholarship on this topic. The concept of ahl al-kitab is shown to have novel relevance for our religiously pluralist world both today and for the future.</description><creator>Wahyudi, Jarot.</creator><contributor>Boullata, Issa J.

It requires scrupulous deciphering in order to understand the author's sense of direction. This is accomplished by studying the movement of madness, that of writing itself. This movement is heliocoidal, spiral shaped; it is a collection of repeated themes nourished with redundancies, replications, insistence and depth. The spiral symbolizes the cyclonic tendency of the characters' torment, a tendency reaching to embrace the heart of this torment. But this insanity cannot be reasonably revealed. The mystery that sustains Chaurette's plays remains complete. This study brings out the repetitive spiral structures present in each text in order to explain their presence and their dynamic. It is an attempt to spell out what the text's language remains unable to say: the essence of one soul's insanity.

Red de Argentinos is explored as an example one of such spaces. Red emerged as an email based solidarity network of the Argentine diaspora and is now a community attached to multiple locales, for which cyberspace has a central articulatory role. These locales include the homeland but, as well, the variety of places in which individuals identifying themselves as Argentinian may be found. This project analyzes some of the factors that allow these types of virtual communities to develop. Special attention is placed on the elements that ensure bonds between members. Self-organization, solidarity, and positioning in relation to the Argentine social reality are seen here as factors that foster the development of a sense of citizenship that is constructed from below in this particular online social space. The need to include the Internet practices of diasporas as part of emerging online cultures in Latin America is finally suggested as an avenue for future exploration.</description><creator>Touza, Leopoldo Sebastián.</creator><contributor>Straw, Will (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Computer networks -- Social aspects.</subject><subject>Argentines -- Ethnic identity.</subject><subject>Internet -- Social aspects</subject><title>Red de Argentinos : identity and citizenship in a virtual community</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xp68kj254.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3484zj68j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Graduate Communications Program</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):25</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
