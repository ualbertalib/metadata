(1499). This study focuses on differing Mediaeval attitudes with respect to passionate love, mostly from the point of view of medical treatises but including specific theologians and moralists. The thesis presented as a medical vade mecum is organized in four chapters. The introduction gives a brief overview of amor hereos and indicates the objectives of the thesis. Chapter one is devoted to the etiology of the sickness and locates the process in La Celestina. The second chapter analyses the symptoms of amor hereos and their manifestations in Calisto and Melibea. Having studied the symptoms, the third chapter is a diagnosis of the sickness suffered by the two main protagonists. The fourth chapter discusses the prognosis and the treatment recommended by the medical profession. Finally, the conclusion describes and compares the physical treatment recommended by medical writers in order to cure the amor hereos of Calisto and Melibea and to what extent their course of treatment agrees with that proposed by Celestina.</description><creator>Blanco Fernández, Julia.</creator><contributor>Magallon, Jesus Perez (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Rojas, Fernando de, d. 1541.

I explore the construction of an Aboriginal identity among residents at the House as an issue of context, where, as Gregory Bateson (1979) suggested, "It is the context that fixes the meaning". Aboriginal identity among residents at Nechi House, I argue, represents an intersection of imbricated discursive practices and personal narratives of self within a highly problematic and contentious symbolic socializing space. Space as I am using the concept in this dissertation is presented as analogous to language and speaks to the larger social order.</description><creator>Brass, Gregory M.</creator><contributor>Norget, Kristin (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Healing -- Religious aspects.</subject><subject>Indians of North America -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- Ethnic identity</subject><subject>Halfway houses -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><subject>Indians of North America -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- Counseling of</subject><title>Respecting "the Medicines" : narrating an aboriginal identity at Nechi House</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xs55md718.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ff3657101</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anthropology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vh53wx70k</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:59:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis, we will try to approach Cioran's work using the fragmentary theory. The different types of fragments (anecdotes, maxims, aphorisms, bio-moments, short essays...) that constitute Cioran's work and that mark its variations, appear to result from sloughing (multiple passages and displacement), so that the one who "sloughes" is never the same but does not fundamentally change. In this perspective, the writing of the fragment may not be a deficiency, a collapsing or a fetichism of the part, but rather a matter of instinct, of experimentation that (re)totalizes as it is been written...like a victory over time and death, like a moment of eternity, like a fragment-trophy.</description><creator>Bolduc, Alexandra.</creator><contributor>Rivard, Yvon (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Cioran, E.

On the one hand, she studies the title of the work, particularly the wide connotation field he alludes to and, on the other hand, the set of themes that links the poetical defence of Dolet to the texts that are added to it. On the basis of that analysis, the author tries to demonstrate the essentially argumentative function of the paratext and she explains how the Second Enfer, in his original architecture, relates to the infernal tradition.</description><creator>Bismuth, Nadine, 1975-</creator><contributor>Desrosiers-Bonin, Diane (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Dolet, Etienne, 1509-1546.

In the contemporary technological context such "untidiness" is effectively erased through instrumental methods of production. A great divide exists between instrumental and poetic modalities of disclosure which is no more apparent than in the arts of cinema and architecture. The motion picture camera is the emblem par excellence of the voyeuristic sensibility of the disembodied 20th century spectator who inevitably is the very same "body" which inhabits the built world. The British artist-filmmaker Peter Greenaway calls into question numerous aspects of traditional and technological ways of looking and making relevant to architectural creation as similarly constitutive of both functional and poetic realms. Rather than suppress or deny the traces left upon a work, he valorizes and amplifies them to create a self-reflexivity between work and working as an intertwining of the process and work horizons. His ultimate concern is for "content" or poetic meaning as the aesthetic experience of depth which he sees as a matter of the form and style of making.</description><creator>Jemtrud, Michael.</creator><contributor>Perez-Gomez, Alberto (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Space (Art)</subject><subject>Greenaway, Peter -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><title>Work as process : Peter Greenaway's twisting of technology</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s1784n55w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z316q3409</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0r967558x</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:59:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Aguascalientes is a medium-sized city in Mexico. Its location and industrial policies have proven favorable to the continuing arrival of many industries. Immigrants are easily inserted into the labor market, but the access to low-cost housing for the workers is difficult. Nevertheless, the city continues to attract newcomers. The economy in Mexico collapsed in the early 90's, and many housing programs at the local level were cancelled, and housing prices became expensive. Consequently, people opted for less expensive housing solutions. One of the alternatives was to build on the ejido land, (expropriated lands handed over to land-less people in the form of collective holding and tenancy) a sui-generis tenure of land that has existed in Mexico since 1917. The analysis of both the ejido lands as a target of irregular human settlements and the consolidation process of these areas is the subject of this study.</description><creator>Hernandez, Carlos, 1968-</creator><contributor>Bhatt, Vikram (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Squatter settlements -- Mexico -- Aguascalientes -- Case studies</subject><subject>Housing -- Mexico -- Aguascalientes -- Case studies</subject><title>Irregular settlements in Mexico, 1990-2000 : case study : ejido lands in Aguascalientes, Mexico</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/37720f79f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0r967558x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:tm70mx374</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:59:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis examines the relationship between women's empowerment and low-income housing sustainability.

The focus of this study is on his paintings of perspectival illusions and his treatise on perspective entitled, Perspectiva pictorum et architectorum published in two volumes in 1693 and 1700. This thesis seeks to understand the work of Pozzo in light of contemporary philosophical debate over the deception of the senses and their ability to distinguish truth from illusion.

This is primarily due to insufficient initial conditions and inadequate convective parameterization schemes (CPSs). This thesis serves to illustrate how these difficulties may be overcome in a real-data simulation of the Garden City, Kansas, tornadic thunderstorm, which occurred during the VORTEX (Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment) field experiment of 1995. Using a sophisticated mesoscale model at 18 km horizontal resolution, a successful reproduction of the environment over southwestern Kansas is obtained. However, modifications to the CPS are required to trigger the Garden City storm at the correct time and location. Utilizing severe weather parameters, it is found that the simulated atmosphere is susceptible to tornadic supercells. The results of a sensitivity study also indicate that a neighbouring storm may have influenced tornadogenesis in the Garden City supercell.</description><creator>Anselmo, David.</creator><contributor>Yan, Peter (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</subject><title>A modelling study of the Garden City, Kansas, storm during VORTEX-95 /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hd76s2033.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b5644t45v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wp988m97h</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:59:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Coronary arteries obstructed by atherosclerosis can be cleared by a balloon angioplasty accompanied by a permanent scaffolding implant ("stent"). There is, however, a 25--45% occurrence rate of excessive thickening of the treated vessel wall a few weeks post-angioplasty, leading to a re-obstruction of the vessel ("restenosis"), and recurrent symptoms. Endovascular radiotherapy, a potential preventive treatment against restenosis, can be delivered by a stent impregnated with radionuclides. The present thesis examines the local dosimetry of radioactive stents. A computer algorithm, D OSECOP, was developed based on the dose point kernel theory, to calculate the dose distribution created by a 32P-implanted stent in the surrounding vessel wall. The dosimetric significance of four parameters is also assessed, namely: (1) mechanical distortions of the stent, (2) the exact location of radionuclides on the stent, (3) the self-attenuation of the stainless steel stent, and (4) the width of the stent's struts in the calculation models.</description><creator>Corbett, Jean-Francois.</creator><contributor>Corns, Robert A.

I sought to find out if these factors played a role in the streaming of Black youths in basic or vocational programs and, if so, to what degree. While looking at the issue, I examined the narratives of both middle-class and working-class students and parents. The study found that a student's socio-economic background largely determine her/his educational stream, be it basic, general or advanced. For example, all the participants in the vocational stream were working-class students while the participants that were streamed into the university bound program were from middle-class families. Teachers within the system also treated the parents differently. Middle-class parents had a greater degree of reciprocity between themselves and teachers compared to working-class parents.</description><creator>Haynes, Janet M.</creator><contributor>Leonard, Peter (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Poor -- Education -- Ontario -- Ottawa.</subject><subject>Blacks -- Education -- Ontario -- Ottawa.</subject><subject>Women -- Education -- Ontario -- Ottawa.</subject><title>The streaming of black socio-economically disadvantaged youths in Ottawa's educational system : a black feminist perspective on educational inequality in Ottawa</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5999n5165.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36v0443</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6w924d592</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:59:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>I use a brand of social contract theory derived from David Gauthier to delimit precisely what might be permissible in the methods of conception and gestation of a child. More specifically, Gauthier posits a rule that is supposed to govern behavior among individuals prior to but in anticipation of the rise of social interaction. I argue that this rule can be appropriately applied to the interactions between a parent and her unborn child. I review other social contract models in an effort to show that Gauthier's is preferable to these. I also address other accounts concerned with parental obligations to the unborn, to see how these fare against Gauthier's. I conclude that, because of its breadth of applicability, as well as its plausibility, Gauthier's model is a powerful force for guiding us through these issues.</description><creator>Sepinwall, Amy J.</creator><contributor>Stroud, Sarah (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Human reproduction -- Social aspects.</subject><subject>Human reproduction -- Moral and ethical aspects.</subject><subject>Gauthier, David P.</subject><subject>Responsibility.</subject><subject>Social contract.</subject><title>Determining parental obligations to unborn children using a social contract theory</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fq977w95x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6w924d592</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Philosophy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q237ht65h</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:59:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>More and more frequently, incidents caused by passengers occur on board commercial aircraft. Disruptive passengers behaviour varies from case to case. They can consist for example in being abusive towards crew members or other fellow passengers, in refusing to follow safety instructions or even in committing acts of violence against persons on board. All these behavioural patterns often jeopardize aviation safety. Airlines have recently become aware of the seriousness of this phenomenon and of the danger it can be for safety. ICAO itself has put a study group in charge of evaluating the situation and making suggestions. The following study analyses at first the answers given to the problem of disruptive passengers by the international conventions related to aviation safety while pointing out that these solutions yet contain serious loopholes. It then examines the question of the airlines liability resulting from acts committed by disruptive passengers and, briefly, the disruptive passengers liability towards the victims of their acts. Finally, after a brief overview of the solutions given by U.S. law, the following study addresses the question of the need of a new international instrument.</description><creator>Schrenzel, Guy.</creator><contributor>Milde, Michael (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</subject><subject>Law.</subject><subject>Transportation.</subject><title>Les passagers perturbateurs : perspectives juridiques</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mg74qn924.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q237ht65h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:794080094</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:59:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Publicists, scholars, and practitioners of international law have yet to produce a sustained analysis of the law of war as applied to armed conflict in outer space. Though no reported cases of armed conflict in space exist, the principal spacefaring nations have contemplated space warfare for decades. Concluding that the general legal regime regulating means and methods of warfare will apply to space combat, should it occur, this thesis attempts a preliminary examination. Chapter One presents a hypothetical space warfare scenario, followed by a chapter on the history of space militarization with a review of existing (and foreseeable) technology useful for space combat. Chapter Three analyzes the international legal regime governing armed conflict, drawing conclusions for space warfare where possible. Chapters Four and Five analyze the legal regime governing the corpus juris spatialis (space law proper), as well as related treaties and instruments supplementing the legal norms for human activity in space, respectively.

It examines the role of the ITU and the WTO in that process and addresses the question of the extent to which globalization and telecommunications liberalization can contribute to development in an increasingly unequal world. It also studies in detail the shift in the institutional regime of telecommunications in Venezuela, whose Telecommunications Bill is analyzed in light of the regulatory principles outlined in the Reference Paper and Venezuela's commitments under the Fourth Protocol to the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). We provide recommendations aimed at adapting the regulatory framework that is currently being discussed to new global market realities without ignoring Venezuela's development concerns and regulatory capabilities.</description><creator>Montero, Julio, 1972-</creator><contributor>Janda, Richard (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Telecommunication -- Law and legislation.</subject><subject>Telecommunication -- Deregulation.</subject><subject>Telecommuncation policy -- Venezuela.</subject><title>The mirage of global telecommunications liberalization : from the post-privatization to the global liberalization era of telecommunications in Venezuela</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s1784n565.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nk322g247</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:f7623f486</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:59:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>International investment has become one of the most important issues on the Post-Uruguay Round Agenda of trade negotiations. The rapid growth of and the critical role in today's global economy played by international investment, as well as its essential link to trade flow necessitates a comprehensive study of the possibility of inserting broad investment provisions in the framework of an organization with trade liberalization objectives, the World Trade Organization. The inclusion of such rules requires: (1) an extensive examination of the existing investment-related provisions of the World Trade Organization Agreements, and the evaluation of their utility, followed by the examination of the recent practices of this Organization with respect to investment; (2) tracing the development of international negotiations on investment measures, from the Uruguay Round to the recent movement to launch a Multilateral Agreement on Investment. This thesis attempts to assess the ground upon which a proposal for a new agreement on investment in the framework of the World trade Organization could be achieved.</description><creator>Salem Haghighi, Sanam.</creator><contributor>de Mestral, A.

Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) converts 5,10-methylenctetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, the folate derivative required for homocysteine remethylation to methionine, the precursor of S-adenosylmethionine. Approximately 45%--50% of the general population is heterozygous for a common substitution (677C → T, A to V) in MTHFR. Due to loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in cancer cells, individuals who are heterozygous for MTHFR in their constitutional DNA may contain only one of the above alleles in their tumor DNA. Loss of heterozygosity of MTHFR was observed in 40% of ovarian carcinoma tumor samples and in 16% of colon carcinoma samples suggesting that the chromosomal location to which the MTHFR gene maps (1p36.3) undergoes frequent LOH. Examination of cell viability of human fibroblasts and of human colon carcinoma cell lines in minimum essential media (MEM) lacking methionine found both cell types to be extremely sensitive to the methionine deficiency. Replacing methionine with homocysteine and vitamin B12 restored the growth of normal fibroblast lines to levels that approached those of replete MEM, but the transformed lines increased proliferation only slightly under these conditions. These results support earlier reports regarding the increased methionine dependence of transformed lines. Targeting specific MTHFR variants with the antisense oligonucleotide resulted in ~50% decreased survival of two carcinoma cell lines (V/V genotype), possibly due to MTHFR's involvement in methionine synthesis. Allele-specific targeting of MTHFR could therefore provide an effective approach for cancer therapy. Furthermore, cancer patients with the V/V genotype may require less aggressive anti-folate chemotherapy since V/V carcinoma lines were highly sensitive to drug treatment (IC50 &lt; 25 nM) whereas the A/A lines were more variable in response.</description><creator>Pereira, Perpetual A.</creator><contributor>Rozen, Rima (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Methionine -- Synthesis.</subject><subject>Cancer -- Chemotherapy.</subject><subject>Folic acid -- Antagonists.</subject><title>Evaluation of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase for targeted therapeutics in cancer</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128ng56x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7d278w14b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4x51hm11g</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:59:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Objectives. The prevalence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Manitoba North American Indians (NAI) is hypothesized to be increased above that of Caucasians (CAUC), but little studied. To evaluate this we studied the prevalence rate of SLE in a population of 1.1 million. Methods. The provincial arthritis center database and the medical records of all rheumatologists, hematologists, nephrologists, and general internists with ≥1 SLE patients were searched for cases of SLE diagnosed between 1980 and 1996. A subset of 175 medical records was reviewed for demographics, SLEDAI scores, SLICC/ACR damage indices, clinical manifestations and therapy. A random survey of 15% of family physicians serving this population suggested that &gt;85% of all SLE cases were identified. Conclusions. The prevalence of S:E was increased twofold in this NAI population. NAI patients had higher SLEDAI scores at diagnosis, more frequent vasculitis and renal involvement, required more treatment later in the disease course, accumulated more damage following diagnosis, and increased fatality.

Porins form water filled channels and allow the diffusion of small hydrophilic solutes up to 1400 Da including nutrients and small antibiotics across the OM. The crystal structures of porins solved to date indicate a conserved motif of a barrel composed of 16 anti-parallel beta-strands. Molecular genetic techniques were used to introduce a hexahistidine tag into surface-exposed loops, loop 4 and loop 8, of Hib porin. Loop 4 was modified by addition of nine amino acids including six consecutive histidine residues following Val-174. Loop 8 was modified by splicing seven amino acids including six consecutive histidines following Thr-321. Plasmids harboring the mutant porins were transformed into a strain of H. influenzae deleted for the wild-type ompP2 gene. The mutant porins, designated OmpP2.H6(L4) and OmpP2.H6(L8), were purified by metal chelate chromatography using Ni-NTA superflow and POROS 20 MC media.

The method improves efficiency by at least a factor of five, and also provides measures of other aspects of behaviour, without the loss of statistical power of the results. Formalin-induced behaviours were examined over the entire range of commonly used formalin concentrations, for a prolonged period of time. The pain response increased dose-dependently up to 2% formalin in the first phase and up to 10% in the second phase if behaviour was scored for at least 90 minutes postformalin. Significant residual pain occurred only at 10% formalin. When morphine dose-effect relationships were examined at varying formalin concentrations, there was a systematic rightward shift in the morphine dose-effect relationships up to about 2% formalin, at which point, further increases in formalin concentration did not produce any further shift, and morphine appeared to noncompetitively antagonize formal in-induced pain.

Recent work in the laboratory has shown that protein tyrosine kinase Csk and protein tyrosine phosphatase PEP form a complex that inactivates Src kinases in the context of antigen receptor signalling. In this manuscript, I demonstrate that this interaction depends on the SH3 domain of Csk and a typical SH3 domain-binding motif (PXXPXR) present within PEP. Moreover, I show that the Csk SH3 domain recognizes sequences flanking the proline-rich core for in vitro and in vivo binding. In a very different mechanism, negative regulation of Jaks seems to depend, at least in part, on a recently cloned SH2 domain-containing adapter protein, termed suppressor of cytokine signalling-1 (SOCS-1). Recent evidence suggests that the inhibitory effect of SOCS-1 on Jak catalytic activity is tightly regulated by transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms. In this report, I propose an additional regulatory mechanism in the form of translational control. I show that SOCS-1 protein levels are strongly repressed by its GC-rich 5' untranslated region. The implications of these results will be discussed.</description><creator>Gregorieff, Alexander.</creator><contributor>Veillette, Andre (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Determinants of the Csk-PEP complex and translational regulation of suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS)-1</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3f4627329.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4f16c4558</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8049g6911</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:59:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The mitogen Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) has been linked to cellular proliferation in atherosclerosis and pulmonary fibrosis. We hypothesized that the PDGF may also be involved in the change in airway smooth muscle (ASM) mass following allergen challenge. Allergic bronchoconstriction was confirmed in the airways of OA sensitized and challenged Brown Norway (BN) rats, a model of allergic asthma. To examine PDGF mRNA expression, total lung RNA was extracted and amplified by RT-PCR for PDGF-A and PDGF-B isoforms. Both PDGF isoforms were found in the control and OA challenged groups. PDGF-B expression was increased after OA challenge in the small airways and parenchyma but no difference was detectable for PDGF-A. Western blotting on the lung tissue homogenate indicated that PDGF-B levels increased after OA challenges. Immunocytochemistry was used to localize the expression of PDGF-B in the ASM and epithelium. Morphometric analysis of the lung sections revealed increases in PDGF-B in the ASM and epithelium of the OA group. Our results indicate that PDGF-A and PDGF-B mRNA are expressed in BN rat lung. Also, PDGF-B protein is upregulated in the airways following allergen challenge. We postulate that aspects of remodeling might be explained by the increased expression of PDGF-B.</description><creator>Greenstone, Elliot Ari.</creator><contributor>Martin, James G.

Intensity can be encoded by response magnitude as well as response latency. The effects of sound intensity and pulse repetition rate on the auditory responses of the tympanal nerve were investigated. Adaptation, a decline in the response due to repeated stimulation, is greater for higher pulse rates and higher intensities. Since sound intensity is louder at the ear closer to the sound source, adaptation is more pronounced in the ipsilateral ear. As a result, the interaural difference in response magnitude decreases. Therefore response magnitude cannot be a reliable cue for sound location. I found that response latency also adapts: it increases over time. However, this change is not intensity dependent. So interaural latency difference is stable over time. The results show that interaural latency difference is a more reliable cue than interaural magnitude difference to locate sound.</description><creator>Givois, Véronique.</creator><contributor>Pollack, Gerald S.

To date, no proposed system for this measurement has been adopted universally. The aim of this study was to evaluate, for the first time, B-mode ultrasound and a new video-bronchoscopic technique in the measurement of the subglottic lumen diameter. This was a blind prospective animal study of 62 recently sacrificed rabbits. Different standardized diameters of the subglottis were measured on each intact animal using ultrasound followed by a video-bronchoscopic technique. These measurements were compared with the corresponding direct caliper results once the subglottis was surgically exposed. Statistical analyses revealed clinically significant convergent values between both indirect (ultrasound and video-bronchoscopic) and direct (caliper) measurements. The study results clearly demonstrate that B-mode ultrasound and this new video-bronchoscopic technique are both precise measuring modalities for the subglottic lumen diameter.</description><creator>Giguère, Chantal Margaret.</creator><contributor>Manoukian, John J.

Merr.] is a tropical to subtropical legume that requires root zone temperatures (RZTs) in the 25 to 30°C range for optimal symbiotic activity. The inability of soybean to adapt to cool soil conditions limits its development and yield in short season areas. In particular, nodulation and nitrogen fixation by this crop species is sensitive to cool RZTs. The isoflavone genistein, which is the most effective plant-to-bacterium signal in the soybean nitrogen fixation symbiosis, has been used to pretreat Bradyrhizobium japonicum inocula. This resulted in increased soybean nodulation and nitrogen fixation in several studies, indicating that genistein preincubated inocula could overcome low RZT inhibition of plant growth and yield. The effectiveness of isoflavones was found to vary among soybean cultivars. Some legume cultivars apparently supply limiting amounts of the flavonoids. The objective of this thesis was to determine how soybean cultivars of different maturity groups would respond to genistein incubation of B. japonicum prior to inoculation. Two field experiments were conducted in 1997 and 1998 involving eleven soybean cultivars of three maturity groups organized in a randomized complete block design. Cells of B. japonicum, treated with genistein or not, were applied onto seeds in the furrow at the time of planting. The results of this study indicated that genistein application increased nodule number and nodule dry matter per plant, increased plant nitrogen content, grain protein and grain yield of all cultivars. There was no interaction between maturity group and genistein application, and there was no correlation between maturity groups and increase in nodulation, total biomass, nitrogen content and yield due to genistein treatment. Thus, responses of soybean cultivars of different maturity groups to genistein treatment are not related to maturity and/or yield potential.</description><creator>Belkheir, Ali Mohamed.</creator><contributor>Smith, Donald L.
