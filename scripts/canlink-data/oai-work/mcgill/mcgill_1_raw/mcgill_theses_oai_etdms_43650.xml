Included are four Canadian novels  published after 1970 that fictionalize the circumstances leading to notorious  criminal trials: Margaret Atwood's Alias Grace (1996), Lynn Crosbie's Paul's Case:  The Kingston Letters (1997), and Rudy Wiebe's The Temptations of Big Bear (1973) and  The Scorched-Wood People (1977). They represent commentaries on the justice or  injustice done to convicted murderer Grace Marks (whose trial took place in 1843),  to rebel Cree chief Big Bear and Metis leader Louis Riel (1885), and to serial  rapists and killers Karla Homolka and Paul Bernardo (1993, 1995). Each work reproduces excerpts from the original trial yet also  represents a response to the historical trial's unfolding. This adversarial response  takes the form of a trial-like narrative (or counternarrative) that engages with the  original trial. Consequently each of these works is what I call a 'trial novel' that  raises fundamental questions about justice and citizenship. Chapter One analyzes Atwood's Alias Grace and lays bare the  fictional constructs included in a trial narrative. Chapter Two looks at Crosbie's  Paul's Case and pits the judicial system's claim to sober neutrality against a more  populist version of justice based on affect and revenge. Finally, Chapter Three,  which is devoted to Wiebe's novels, studies the conflict of normative universes  implicit in trials for treason and posits that rebel nomoi are as coherent as the  dominant ones that quash them. Three communities are implicit in these novels and enter into a  debate with one another: at the core of each work is a historical community of  persons (the accused, attorneys, the judge, jurors, and members of the Canadian  public) mobilized around an actual crime. This original community and its judgment  provide the inspiration for the fictional community of the novel, which grapples  with its own version of the crime and trial. Finally, an imaginative community of  readers deliberates upon the questions raised both by the original trial and by the  'trial novel'.</description><creator>Blanc, Marie Thérèse, 1960-</creator><contributor>Cooke, Nathalie (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2004</date><subject>Wiebe, Rudy Henry, 1934- .

The MTDC system enables several AC systems to be integrated by way of a DC  network. Potential applications of the MTDC system are: off-shore wind farms, city  center feeds. The complexity of the combined AC/DC circuits and their  cross-coupling make it difficult to adjust the VSC control parameters to eliminate  sustained oscillations and instability which appear frequently. The control part of  the thesis is a systematic investigation which addresses the  problems. Firstly, the mechanism of sustained oscillations is discovered  to be cross-converter resonance between the AC and DC circuits of a VSC system.  Secondly, the unstable modes have been identified by establishing the small signal  perturbation model of the entire MTDC system and applying eigenvalue analysis. The  general philosophy adopted in the solution consists of reducing complexity by  partitioning the MTDC system into several independent subsystems by applying DC  voltage decoupling and AC current-tracking techniques at each VSC station. This  eliminates the cross-converter resonance. It is found that the addition of damping  filters stabilize the MTDC. Because AC fault protection is standard know-how, the thesis  focuses on protection against faults in the DC network of MTDC system. After gaining  knowledge on DC fault characteristics, four protection strategies (which have  different costs to be balanced against restoration times) are developed. The  location of the faulted DC line and its isolation (so that the remainder of the DC  network can resume service) is a most challenging task. The Handshaking Method is  invented to handle this problem. Selective fault detection schemes, which ensure,  for example, that AC faults are not mistaken for DC faults, are also developed.  During a DC fault, the DC capacitors can become unbalanced and a method of balancing  the DC capacitors during the restoration stage is developed. Digital simulations have been used to demonstrate the  feasibility of the control and protection strategies.</description><creator>Tang, Lianxiang, 1970-</creator><contributor>Ooi, Boon-Teck (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Control and protection of multi-terminal DC transmission systems based on voltage-source converters</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rr171x74w.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mw22v592z</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6t053g55j</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:24:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this thesis is to provide new evidence on the  pricing of foreign exchange risk in the stock market by testing international asset  pricing models (IAPMs) under varying market structures and different exchange rate  measures. It is composed of three essays. In the first essay, I test unconditional  asset pricing models with exchange risk using country, portfolio and firm level data  from nine emerging markets (EMs). It is shown that unlike the case for developed  markets where unconditional tests often fail to detect a significant exchange risk  premium in stock returns, exchange risk is unconditionally priced in EMs. However,  when local market risk is introduced in the model to take into account potential  segmentation effects, exchange risk premia are totally subsumed by local risk premia  for most countries especially at the firm level. The second essay examines the  significance of exchange risk in conditional IAPMs using multivariate GARCH-in-Mean  specification and time varying prices of risk. The model tested assumes partial  integration and uses real exchange rates to account for both inflation risk and  nominal exchange risk. The main empirical results support the hypothesis of  significant exchange risk premia in EMs equity returns even after accounting for  local market risk. The exchange risk premia are also economically significant as  they represent on average 18 percent of total premium, and may reach up to 45  percent of total premium for some countries over sub-periods. In the third essay, I  test for the pricing of exchange risk in stock returns using globally diversified  sector portfolios. The purpose of this test is to examine the effect of  cross-currency diversification on the global price of foreign exchange risk. Since  there is no previous evidence on this issue, I use data on the G7 countries and EMs.  The results suggest that the effects of exchange risk may be less significant in  pricing global assets such as global s</description><creator>Majerbi, Basma</creator><contributor>Carrieri, Francesca (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Errunza, Vihang (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Foreign exchange</subject><subject>Capital assets pricing model.</subject><subject>Stocks.</subject><title>Essays in international asset pricing and foreign exchange risk</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h702q685f.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6t053g55j</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Management</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rx913q41s</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:24:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is an attempt to examine Anglo-American relations at  the end of World War One, when Great Britain was no longer preeminent in world  affairs and the United States was as yet unwilling to continue the responsibilities  that it had taken during the war. Lloyd George who sought to keep the threads of  power in his hands appointed Auckland Geddes as Ambassador to the United States, a  man who was personally loyal to him, thus seeking to bypass Lord Curzon's authority  as Foreign Secretary. Matters were complicated by the declining influence of  President Wilson and the growth of isolationist sentiment in the United States. The  advent of the Harding administration created further difficulties as Harding felt  compelled to yield to the influence of public opinion which rejected the Treaty of  Versailles and the League of Nations. Various issues had to be resolved, the future of the  Anglo-Japanese Alliance, the war debt, differences over the mandate of Yap, and the  question of oil from the Middle East. Here the dealings of Anglo-American relations  during Curzon's tenure at the Foreign Office are examined. Curzon took a  conventional approach to Anglo-American negotiations. While Great Britain struggled  to improve conditions with the United States, the outcome was nothing like the  special relationship that manifested itself after 1945. Curzon's conventional view  of foreign policy clashed with Lloyd George's essentially personal approach to  foreign affairs. Geddes who was intended to be the Prime Minister's confidential  agent proved, except on the question of the war debt, inadequate to the  task.</description><creator>Blake, Timothy R.</creator><contributor>Elbourne, J.

Potential benefits include  fewer overdoses, decreased rates of HIV, Hepatitis, and other blood-borne viruses, a  reduction in open drug use, increased opportunities for health services and  treatments, and cost savings to society. A pilot safer injection site is expected to  open in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside in September 2003. This study assesses  community attitudes and concerns with respect to SIFs. Focus groups with police  officers, street nurses, and injection drug users in February and March 2003  revealed that they are supportive of the sites. Concerns related to the community  impacts, external supports, administration, process, safety, and special populations  (e.g. women, youth) were indicated. Special attention should be paid to the  involvement of injection drug users in planning and programming, the inclusion of  peer workers, the relationships between injection drug users, the wider population,  and the police, and safety for marginalized populations. Recommendations to address  concerns and ensure inclusive processes are provided.</description><creator>Malowaniec, Leah</creator><contributor>Rowe, William (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Injecting drug users -- British Columbia -- Vancouver</subject><subject>Harm reduction -- British Columbia -- Vancouver</subject><subject>Vancouver (B.C.) -- Social conditions</subject><subject>Hypodermic needles -- Health aspects -- British Columbia -- Vancouver</subject><title>Determining community attitudes and concerns with respect to the establishment of safer injection facilities in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sx61dm83z.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hc680</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0v838107g</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:24:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This multi-case study compared the practices and knowledge of  six experienced teachers who perceive themselves to use an inquiry approach to  instruction, to those of two teachers who do not, and compared their  conceptualizations to a portrait of the inquiry literature. The inquiry teachers  were purposively selected from three levels---elementary, secondary, and  university---and different subjects. They and two non-inquiry teachers contributed three interviews  each. Transcripts were coded using codes derived from the literature, then open  coding using the teachers' own words to represent categories. Four postulated  constructs of inquiry, process, content, strategy, and context, were found in the  literature and in experienced inquiry teachers' detailed conceptualizations of  inquiry as shown in their definitions, interviews, and concept maps. Inquiry  teachers were distinguished from the non-inquiry teachers by the relative difference  in the frequency of their use of the four constructs. The inquiry teachers each had  one predominant construct that they emphasized more in their teaching, and their  identity could be expressed in terms of their pedagogical use of these four  constructs. The non-inquiry teachers made fewer inquiry statements when compared to  the literature and when compared to their own personal statements. Inquiry teachers'  background, education, and informal experiences were also directly related to their  conceptualizations of inquiry.</description><creator>Manconi, Lynn</creator><contributor>Aulls, Mark W.

To  investigate these impacts, vertical profiles of delta13C, delta 15N, Corg,  Corg:Ntot, FeHC1 , MnHCl, Ptot, PHCl, SO4 2-, AVS, Hgtot, and Hgpyrite in sediment  cores collected throughout the bay were acquired. These profiles were then used to  identify tracers of aquaculture activities and their impact on the redox zonation of  the sediment. In addition, representative samples of fish food as well as farmed and  wild salmon were analyzed to determine their Hg tot content as well as delta13C,  delta15N, Corg, Corg:Ntot. Our results show that, as by-products of salmon aquaculture  (e.g., uneaten food, feces, antibiotics, and anti-fouling agents) accumulate in the  sediments, their reactive organic carbon content increases and generate a greater  oxygen demand. Subsequently, an upwards migration of the oxygen penetration depth  and redox boundaries in the sediment column occurs, which is confirmed on the basis  of the distribution of redoxsensitive phases (e.g., authigenic metal oxides and AVS)  in the sediments. High resolution voltammetric microelectrode measurements show that  the FeHCl and MnHCl distributions overestimate the oxygen penetration depth in the  sediments. The total phosphorus distribution in the sediment record is shown to be a  suitable tracer of marine aquaculture, reflecting the recent history of residual  feed and fecal matter accumulation in the sediments. Elevated mercury concentrations in sediments under fish pens are  explained by its strong affinity for organic carbon. Although the source of  additional Hg has yet to be resolved, as the organic carbon content of the sediments  increases in response to the input from fish farming activities, so does the  associated Hg. Mercury also partitions strongly to authigenic pyrite in the deeper  sulfidic sediments. Of the few farmed Atlantic salmon analyzed, mercury levels were  not elevated compared to the concentrations of mercury in the wild salmon captured  in two rivers of the Canadian east coast.</description><creator>Musclow, Sandy Lee</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Geochemistry.</subject><subject>Agriculture, Fisheries and Aquaculture.</subject><title>Impact of salmon aquaculture on sediment chemistry and mercury loading</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wp988k41f.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dz010q53v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hh63sw351</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:24:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The semiconductor ZnO has a band gap of 3.3 eV and has potential  in applications as transparent and conducting layers for electronic devices. In the  present work, experiments have been carried out to deposit thin films of ZnO on  glass and silicon substrates by RF magnetron sputtering. The deposition experiments  were performed at substrate temperatures in a range from room value to  400°C. Resistivity measurements were performed on the films. The resistivity  increased as the substrate temperature was increased from room value to  400°C. The films on the silicon substrates were then processed into  ZnO(n)-Si(p) heterojunctions whereas the ones on glass substrates were processed  into metal-ZnO-metal MSM devices. Dark current-voltage and capacitance-voltage  characteristics of the fabricated devices have been studied in order to determine  the effects of substrate temperature during the deposition. In addition, post  deposition heat treatment experiments were performed and the effects were examined  by the electrical measurements. For the samples deposited at room temperature, the  resistivity was observed to decrease drastically after a heat treatment at  150°C for 30 minutes. Illuminated characteristics of both the heterojunctions and MSM  devices were also studied in a wavelength range from 300 to 700 nm. It was observed  that UV responsivity for the ZnO-Si heterojunctions shows an increase from 210 to  300°C and a large decrease at 400°C. Under illumination, the current  at given voltage increases for all samples and this has been confirmed to be mainly  due to the bandgap absorption. From the post deposition heat treatment experiments  carried out at low temperatures, the dark current was observed to increase with heat  treatment time. However, the photocurrent was also observed to increase with the  heat treatment time.</description><creator>Wang, Ting,</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Physics, Condensed Matter.</subject><title>ZnO heterojunctions and schottky junctions for ultraviolet detectors</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c534fp459.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hh63sw351</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pc289j48s</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:24:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study investigated the possibility of three approaches in  determination of soil moisture in the root zone. The aim of the study was to  contribute to the development of soil moisture monitoring methods to better help  crop best management practices. Two fields were examined, one at the Macdonald Campus of McGill  University and the other near St. Jean-sur-Richelieau. Three approaches were used;  (1) a hand-held hyper-spectral sensor (350-2500 nm), (2) a Geonics RTM EM-38  conductivity meter and, (3) gravimetric soil moisture sampling. The first experiment (at St. Jean-sur-Richelieu) investigated  the possibility of monitoring soil moisture with the EM_38, in the presence of field  elevation and soil texture. The second experiment (at Macdonald Campus) investigated  the possibility of using hyper-spectral sensor data for determination of soil  characteristics in the root zone, in the presence of such factors as (a) irrigation  (main treatment), (b) nitrogen (sub-treatment), and (c) weed control  (sub-sub-treatment). Statistical regression analyses and Artificial Neural Network  models were used to select the best waveband region for determination of soil root  zone moisture. The coefficients of determination obtained by the statistical  analyses ranged from 0.75 to 0.94. The wavebands most frequently identified by these  analyses ranged from 1100 nm-1900 nm. The performances of the ANN training models were considered  acceptable (R2 from 0.6 to 0.8). The lack of sufficient data greatly impacts this  approach.</description><creator>Erindi-Kati, Anila</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Corn -- Effect of stress on -- Québec (Province) -- Remote sensing.</subject><subject>Soil moisture -- Québec (Province) -- Remote sensing.</subject><subject>Multispectral photography.</subject><title>Remote sensing and root zone soil moisture</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nv935349n.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pc289j48s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Bioresource Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rn301192g</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:24:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM), a member of the saposin like  protein (SAPLIP) family, is a lysosomal hydrolase that converts sphingomyelin to  ceramide. The deficient activity of ASM causes a variant form (i.e., type A/B) of  the inherited disorder Niemann-Pick disease. The lysosomal targeting mechanism of  ASM has not been conclusively identified. Previous studies suggested that ASM could  use another membrane-associated receptor as well as M6P receptor to target  lysosomes. Sortilin, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, belongs to a novel family  of receptor proteins. Both the luminal domain and the cytoplasmic domain of sortilin  show structural features typical of receptors involved in lysosomal or vacuolar  targeting. Using a dominant-negative sortilin construct lacking the cytoplasmic  tail, I proved that sortilin was involved in the lysosomal targeting of ASM.  Confocal microscopy revealed that truncated sortilin partially inhibited the  lysosomal targeting of ASM in COS 7 cells and completely abolished the lysosomal  targeting of ASM in I-cells. Pulse-chase experiments also suggested that sortilin  was involved in normal sorting of newly synthesized ASM. Over-expression of  truncated sortilin accelerated and enhanced the secretion of ASM from COS 7 cells  and I-cells. Co-immunoprecipitation assays further confirmed the interaction between  sortilin and ASM.

The goal of the present study was to investigate  whether high frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (HFS STN), for the  treatment of motor signs and symptoms characteristic of Parkinson disease (PD), has  detrimental consequences for cognitive processing. Methods . An extensive battery of  neuropsychological tests was administered to 15 PD patients with bilateral  implantation of high frequency stimulators of the subthalamic nucleus for the  treatment of PD. Patients were tested in two sessions: during one session the  stimulator was set to a satisfactory therapeutic level and in the other the  stimulator was set to OFF. Results. Statistically significant differences between  sessions were not observed on task variables measuring executive function, verbal  working memory, attention, language, visuospatial perception and verbal and  visuospatial memory. In contrast, significant improvements with stimulation were  observed for motor signs and symptoms and on tasks measuring skilled motor function.  Conclusion. We investigated the specific cognitive effects of HFS STN in  non-demented patients diagnosed with late stage PD. Our findings suggest that in  relatively young patients with no symptoms of dementia or psychiatric disorder, the  impact on cognitive processing is minimal.</description><creator>Fraraccio, Maria</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Effects of high frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus on cognitive function in Parkinson's disease</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1j92g807b.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/np193961g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cv43nx47p</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:24:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is caused by  mutations of the PKD1 or PKD2 genes. Cyst cells exhibit sustained expression of  fetal genes such as PAX2. Normally, PAX2 is involved in kidney development and is  rapidly downregulated after birth. Overactivity of the canonical beta-catenin  signaling pathway has also been linked to the formation of renal cysts. To determine  whether beta-catenin activity is linked to the level of PAX2 expression in vivo, we  created a transgenic mouse overexpressing PAX2 in mature proximal tubules of the  kidney. Here we report that the canonical beta-catenin signaling activity is  increased in mice bearing the targeted PAX2 transgene. There is also evidence that non-canonical Writ signaling may be  involved in the development of renal cysts but this pathway is uncharacterized. We  therefore studied the ontogeny of a downstream marker of this pathway (NFAT) and its  localization in the developing kidney. Here we report that NFAT activity is high in  early stages of kidney development and is rapidly downregulated at birth. The NFAT  signal is diffuse and is expressed in both mesenchymal and epithelial cells of the  developing kidney.</description><creator>Patenaude, Anne-Marie</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Wnt signaling in kidney development and implication in polycystic kidney disease</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z316q196r.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cv43nx47p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Human Genetics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1g05fc09p</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:24:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The effects of feeding soy protein (SP) or SP plus isoflavones  (IF) (150 and 400 mg IF/kg diet) on bone metabolism were assessed in female weanling  and retired breeder (RB) rats fed low calcium (Ca) for five weeks.

Furthermore  the considered surfaces are mostly convex and non-undulating. Here, I attempt to  expand on some of the previous results, by examining the frequency characteristics  of the global motion of specular markings on random, undulating surfaces subject to  a lateral camera motion with constant velocity. I first expand the notion of a  bowtie in the Fourier domain introduced by Langer and Mann[7] to accommodate the  case of a smooth undulating surface, and then attempt to show that in most cases the  global motion of the specular components for the considered surface and motion  display roughly a similar power spectrum signature as the Lambertian components,  characterized by a continuum of motions plane intersecting at the origin, which I  call a blurred bowtie. The subtle discrepancies between the frequency profile of the  Lambertian and specular components are also examined in the scope of this  thesis.</description><creator>Farasat, Yousef</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Motions of specularities on undulating surfaces</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1c18dg24j.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qv33rx180</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hq37vp07m</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:24:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Many liver diseases such as Alcoholic Liver Disease and  Hepatitis C are associated with the production of autoantibodies. One of these  autoantibodies is Rheumatoid Factor (RF), which binds to IgG and can aid in host  defense. Since little is known about the role of RF in liver disease, we  characterized the production of this autoantibody in three murine models of liver  damage using alcohol, anti-Fas antibodies and carbon tetrachloride. RF was induced  in response to chronic alcohol consumption as well as intraperitoneal injection of  anti-Fas antibodies. RF was not produced in response to treatment with carbon  tetrachloride for four weeks. Concurrent treatment with an E. coli glycolipoprotein  which induces RF protected against liver damage as measured by a decrease in liver  enzymes. Importantly, RF induced by this glycolipoprotein did not contribute to  damage in the liver, suggesting that in the context of liver damage RF is not  necessarily pathological.</description><creator>Nowak, Urszula</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><title>Rheumatoid factor production in response to liver damage</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pv63g071t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hq37vp07m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bv73c101k</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:24:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Ribonucleic acids (RNA) are polymers of ribonucleotides linked  together by 3',5'-phosphodiester linkages and play a prominent role in protein  biosynthesis. Much less common are ribonucleic acids based on 2',5'-phosphodiester  linkages (2',5'-RNA). In this study, the synthesis, physical and biological  properties of several 2' ,5'-linked oligoribonucleotides are  described. One aspect of this thesis deals with the synthesis and  structural studies of 2',5'-dodecaribonucleotides. Their base sequence was designed  to promote intramolecular folding by base pairing leading to the formation of  "hairpin loops". The hairpins consist of a tetranucleotide loop and a 4  base-pair duplex (stem). The thermodynamic stability and conformation of these  hairpins were assessed by UV, CD and NMR spectroscopy. Melting experiments (UV)  revealed that with a few exceptions, hairpins comprised of 2',5'-(UUCG) loops  exhibit greater thermodynamic stability (e.g. Tm) than the corresponding hairpins  with 3' ,5'-linked loops. The 'extra' stability imparted by the 2',5'-UUCG) loop was  found to be virtually independent of the sugar composition of the stem. For example,  the 2',5'-tetraloop stabilizes hairpins whether their duplex stem is based on  double-stranded DNA or RNA. In contrast, the 3',5-tetraloop stabilizes hairpins only  when their stem duplex is double-stranded RNA. NMR studies revealed that the  2',5'-tetraloop (UUCG) is self-stabilized by a wobble U·G base pair,  extensive base stacking and sugar-base contacts. A more striking feature is the  protrusion of the cytosine residue into the solvent without participating in any of  the loop stabilizing interactions. This identifies the 2',5 '-linked (UUCG) loop as  a novel structural motif and provides the first demonstration that 2',5' can fold  back on itself to form a hairpin structure of unusual thermodynamic  stability. The ability of hairpin structures to inhibit human  immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) was also evaluated. Four  potent hairpins based on 3',5'- and 2' ,5'-RNA were able to inhibit the RNase H  activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, a key enzyme for the proliferation of the  human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). The polymerase activity of HIV-1 RT was not  affected by this class of oligonucleotides. The hairpins were identified from a  nucleic acid library synthesized via diversity-oriented solid-phase synthesis. These  compounds represent the first examples of hairpins, 12 nucleotides in length, that  inhibit specifically the RNase H activity of HIV-1 RT without affecting its  polymerase activity. Another study in this work dealt with yeast RNase III (Rnt1p),  an enzyme implicated in the mechanism of action of RNA interference (RNAi). Through  these investigations, it was discovered that Rntlp cleaves the DNA strand of DNA:RNA  hybrids. This was totally unexpected since Rntlp, like other RNase III enzymes, was  thought to be specific only towards the cleavage of double-stranded RNA. These  studies also increased our knowledge about the mechanism by which the enzyme cleaves  the target RNA (or DNA) strand and suggest that the vicinal 2'-hydroxyl group on the  ribose sugar does not participate directly in the cleavage reaction. Finally, the formation of C-tetrad structures (i-motif) was  induced through the design and synthesis of extra-stable hairpin loops containing  deoxycytidine rich stems. The corresponding hairpins containing ribocytidine folded  into duplexes rather than C-tetrad structures. These studies lead to the first  detection and identification of antiparallel 2',5 '-RNA duplexes based on  hemiprotonated C·C+ base pairs.</description><creator>Hannoush, Rami Nabil</creator><contributor>Damtra, Masad (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>RNA folding : synthesis, structure and biological properties of hairpins based on 2',5'-linked RNA loops</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z029p521n.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bv73c101k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3t945r336</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:24:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate, plays an important  role in synaptic transmission, brain development and plasticity as well as  excitotoxicity. The biological functions of glutamate in neurons are mediated by ion  channel-gated or G-protein-coupled receptors that are also located on glial cells,  including oligodendrocytes. However, the functions of glutamate receptors in  oligodendrocytes and their progenitors remain unknown. The objective of work  presented in this thesis was to characterize the effects of glutamate on  oligodendrocyte progenitors and the intracellular signaling pathways involved in  mediating these effects. Glutamate caused a time- and concentration-dependent increase in  inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) levels in oligodendrocyte progenitors. Using  selective antagonists, we demonstrated that the effect of glutamate was mediated by  an ionotropic receptor of the AMPA subtype. Glutamate-stimulated phospholipase C  (PLC) activation was triggered by Ca2+ influx through AMPA receptors as well as  through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and the Na+/Ca2+ exchangers operating in the  reverse mode. Furthermore, the AMPA receptor agonists, AMPA and kainate, increased  phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) subtype of the  mitogen-activated protein kinase family. ERK activation required extracellular Ca2+  and activation of PLC and protein kinase C (PKC). The involvement of PKC was further  supported by the observed kainate-induced translocation of PKC, measured by PDBu  binding. Interestingly, a phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and a pertussis  toxin-sensitive G-protein are part of the signaling cascade leading to ERK  activation. In addition, glutamate and kainate caused an increase in c-fos  expression. Both extracellular Ca2+ and PKC, which are upstream activators of ERK,  were required for c-fos gene expression. Blocking the ERK pathway reduced  kainate-induced c-fos expression, indicating that ERK was involved in transmitting  signaling events to the nucleus. In addition, the effect of glutamate on the  development of oligodendrocyte progenitors was examined. We found that glutamate, at  the non-toxic concentrations, inhibited the proliferation of oligodendrocyte  progenitors. Excessive activation of AMPA receptors, achieved  pharmacologically by inhibiting receptor desensitization with cyclothiazide, was  toxic to oligodendrocyte progenitors. Ensuing cell death displayed several features  characteristic of apoptosis, including DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation and  caspase-3 activation. Underlying molecular mechanisms implicated in excitotoxicity  included massive Ca2+ influx, intracellular glutathione depletion and activation of  c-Jun N-terminal kinase and calpain. Furthermore, the antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine,  prevented cell death by maintaining intracellular glutathione  levels. Collectively, our findings show that glutamate, acting via the  AMPA receptor, initiates multiple signal transduction pathways that may be involved  in the growth and/or survival of oligodendrocytes.</description><creator>Liu, Hsueh-Ning, 1970-</creator><contributor>Almazan, Guillermina (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</subject><title>Glutamatergic signaling in oligodendrocyte progenitors</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2z10wq73f.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3t945r336</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9019s299p</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:24:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis investigates non-native language acquisition of the  verbal and nominal functional domains in Second language (L2) English and  second/third language (L2/L3) French by Chinese and Vietnamese speakers. Six  experimental studies are reported. Two current competing theories in the field of  theoretical second language acquisition (L2A), namely, the Failed Features  Hypothesis (FFH) and the Full Transfer Full Access (FTFA) model are compared and  their applicability to third language acquisition (L3A) evaluated in the light of  our data. A version of the Minimalist Program is assumed in this work.  Predictions based on FFH and FTFA are as follows: As far as L2A is concerned, both  FFH and FTFA predict full transfer of L1 in the L2 initial state. With respect to  L3A, FFH predicts the initial state to be L1 while FTFA predicts either L1 or L2.  The two models diverge regarding their predictions on the L2/L3 transitional and  steady states. In particular, FFH hypothesizes permanent "failure" and  persistent L1 influence in L2/L3 interlanguage while FTFA hypothesizes full access  and acquirability of target structures. Three L2/L3 experimental studies on the verbal functional domain  (i.e. tense and agreement) and another three on the nominal functional domain (i.e.  the Determiner Phrase) were conducted. Subjects include Chinese monolingual learners  of English, Vietnamese monolingual learners of French as well as Chinese-English  bilingual learners of French. A variety of tasks were used to test the predictions  made by the two models. Results demonstrate partial transfer of L1 in the L2 initial  state and of L2 in the L3 initial state, and point towards full access in the L2/L3  steady states. These findings do not seem to be consistent with FFH. It appears that  FTFA is a more viable theory for non-native language acquisition. We also contend  that L3A is not simply another case of L2A.</description><creator>Leung, Yan-kit Ingrid.</creator><contributor>White, Lydia (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>English language -- Study and teaching -- Chinese speakers.</subject><subject>French language -- Study and teaching -- Chinese speakers.</subject><subject>Second language acquisition -- Case studies.</subject><subject>French language -- Study and teaching -- Vietnamese speakers.</subject><title>Functional categories in second and third language acquisition : a cross-linguistic study of the acquisition of English and French by Chinese and Vietnamese speakers</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2227mq22v.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9019s299p</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Linguistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:37720d32b</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:24:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The present study explores the relationship between language and  architecture as symbolic systems against the background of the creation of  independent Czechoslovakia at the end of World War I. It takes as its focus the  Prague Castle, and the intent of the first President of Czechoslovakia, philosopher  Thomas Garrigue Masaryk (1850--1937), to "democratize" the vast complex of  historic structures that formed it, with the help of the Slovenian architect Joze  Plecnik (1872--1957). To effect change in the charged, historically circumscribed  spaces of the Castle can be viewed as a language analogy mainly in the terms of  creating new relationships . Polysemy is a characteristic, sometimes dominant,  feature of the transformation process. In the hierarchy of public spaces, the Castle was meant to  constitute the ultimate symbolic space not just for Prague, but for the entire  nation. Memory as recollection, but also as imagination and ingegno, impelled  symbolic action both verbally and architecturally. Plecnik's own "grammar of  creation" sought constitutive forms in the traditions of Antiquity and ancient  Egypt, in Masaryk's ideas of democratic governance as well as in the collective  memory of the city. These were the informing principles that created a more layered  referential field. The invention of the tradition and symbolic identity of the  Castle in the new context of republican Czechoslovakia was a complex process  accompanied by competing narratives. Masaryk wished the Castle to become "a  symbol of our [Czech and Slovak] national democratic ideals," and spoke of a  need to "embody" the new parliament in search for an ethical existence  rooted in faith and self-education, imbued with both scientific rigour and poetic  making, and implemented through the everyday work by all citizens. A unique example of another type of narrative is a body of  correspondence addressed to Plecnik between 1920 and 1956 by the President's  daughter, Alice Garrigue Masaryk (1879--1966), who represented her father in his  role as patron and served as a conduit between him, the Castle Building  Administration and Plecnik himself. A close reading of these letters explores to  interrogate the role of language in both the transmission of tradition and in the  actual process of architectural making and constitutes an original contribution to  scholarship.</description><creator>Žantovská Murray, Irena, 1946-</creator><contributor>Perez-Gomez, Alberto (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Masaryk, Alice Garrigue, 1879-1966</subject><subject>Prague (Czech Republic) -- Buildings, structures, etc.</subject><subject>Masaryk, T.

After a brief recapitulation of the progress  of Sufi orders in and beyond Java, it looks at the life and activities of Shaykh  Sambas, and analyzes in particular his work Fatḥ al-`Arifin, situating  it against the Qadiriyya and Naqshbandiyya sources that inspired it. The focus then  switches to the transmission of the TQN doctrines by Sambas's disciples, especially  `Abd al-Karim Banten (b. 1840), and the gradual dispersal of the order throughout  the archipelago, which resulted in the formation of branches that maintained  separate existences but largely similar teachings. This leads into a discussion of  the TQN of Suryalaya (west Java), one of the most significant branches of the TQN in  present-day Indonesia, although some attention is given also to other TQN centers,  such as Mranggen and Rejoso in central and east Java, and to the writings of shaykhs  in these regions. Although the main teachings of the ṭariqa have  remained constant, local shaykhs have some cases developed in response to local  circumstances; thus we find in the case of the TQN of Suryalaya, that its shaykh,  Kiyai Haji Shohibulwafa Tajul `Arifin (better known as Abah Anom) has concentrated  on dhikr as an educational tool and as a means towards healing young drug addicts  and victims of other mental illnesses. The spiritual and social benefits of TQN  teachings came across clearly in Abah Anom's work Miftaḥ  al-Ṣudur, which contains his views on a variety of mystical subjects,  and which is analyzed in the final chapter. There we find that Abah Anom preserves  TQN teachings intact while stressing some of its aspects and de-emphasizing others  that preoccupied the order's founder, such as the doctrine of  muraqaba.</description><creator>Sri Mulyati</creator><contributor>Landolt, Hermann A.

These masses are grouped in pairs and each pair is  based on a different model. Knowing that the compositional approaches to parody vary  from one composer to one another, the objectives of this research are as follows:  (1) comparison of the parodic approach of two composers in masses based on the same  model; (2) comparison of pairs of masses, considering that Palestrina and Lassus  treat two of the three models; (3) comparison of the three masses of Lassus written  on three different models. The synoptic approach to analysis is very interesting, because  after the simultaneous identification of the motives in the model and in the mass  movements (Kyrie and Credo), the entire complex of selected motives and their use in  the construction of the modules become very easily detectable. The results of this  research show that: (1) the model does not dictate the treatment, because the same  model is treated differently by two composers; for instance, two masses of  Palestrina based on different models are more alike, than those of Palestrina and  Lassus based on the same model; (2) the model seems to be more attractive to the  composer when it is one of his own compositions; for example, Palestrina borrows  more material from his madrigal Io son ferito to build his Missa Petra Sancta, than  Lassus does it in his Missa super Io son ferito ahi lasso based on the same model;  (3) the style of the model does not determine the style of the mass; motifs from a  non-imitative model can be treated in imitation in the mass, and (4) the sections of  the Kyrie are more suited to formal development (generated by the repetitions of  modules), than those of the Credo.</description><creator>Lessoil-Daelman, Marcelle</creator><contributor>Cumming, Julie (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Parody in music.</subject><subject>Mass (Music) -- Analysis, appreciation.</subject><title>Une approche synoptique des motifs et des modules dans la messe parodique /</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sn009z32q.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jm214p62z</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bz60cw79b</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:24:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>With the development of Geographical Information System (GIS)  and remote sensing techniques, a great deal of data has provided a set of continuous  samples of the earth surface from local, regional to global scales. Several  multi-scale, multi-resolution, pyramid or hierarchical methods and statistical  methods have been developed and used to investigate the scaling property of remotely  sensed data: local variance, texture method, scale variance, semivariogram, and  fractal analysis. This research introduces the wavelet transform into the realm of  scale study in remote sensing and answers three research questions. Three specific  objectives corresponding to the three research questions are answered. They include:  (1) exploration of wavelets for scale-dependent analysis of remotely sensed imagery;  (2) examination of the relationships between wavelet coefficients and classification  accuracy for different resolutions and their improvement of classification accuracy;  and (3) multiscaling analysis and stochastic down-scaling of an image by using the  wavelet transform and multifractals. The significant results obtained are: (1) Haar  wavelets can be used to investigate the scale-dependent and spatial structure of an  image and provides another method for selection of optimal sampling size; (2) there  is a good relationship between classification accuracy and wavelet coefficients.  High/low wavelet coefficient reflects low/high classification accuracy in each land  cover type. (3) the maximum likelihood classifier with inclusion of wavelet  coefficients can improve land cover classification accuracies. (4) the moment-scale  analysis of wavelet coefficients can be used to investigate the multifractal  properties of an image. Also the stochastic down-scaling model developed based on  wavelet and multifractal generates good simulation results of the fine resolution  image.</description><creator>Li, Junhua, 1970-</creator><contributor>Lewis, John (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Remote sensing.</subject><subject>Wavelets (Mathematics)</subject><subject>Multifractals.</subject><title>Scale analysis in remote sensing based on wavelet transform and multifractal modeling</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w6634422w.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bz60cw79b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h128nf278</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:24:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Although the study of Thule harpoon heads has produced important  seriations, datings and technological reflections during the last century, a lack of  fundamental knowledge about these weapons is still occurring. An attempt is made to  document the different contexts surrounding the use of these artifacts.  Technological, social and symbolic investigations are made on the occupants of the  Skraeling Island site (High Arctic, Canada) and the Clachan site (Coronation Gulf,  Canada) in order to build a complete understanding of the harpoon head morphological  attributes. Using the hierarchical cluster analysis (SPSS), groupings have been  statistically formed, underlying the meaningful dimensions of variation of the  objects. It is then found that technological, social and symbolic mechanisms are  systematically responsible for different aspects of Thule harpoon head morphology,  and by comparing the two archaeological assemblages, we conclude that these  mechanisms operate in the same direction, even if resulting in different harpoon  head styles.</description><creator>Gadoua, Marie-Pierre</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Nunavut -- Antiquities.</subject><subject>Thule culture -- Nunavut.</subject><subject>Harpoons, Prehistoric -- Nunavut.</subject><title>Chasse aux mammifères marins et identité ethnique : le rôle du harpon au sein de la culture thuléenne : analyse comparative des sites Clachan et de l'île Skraeling</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tq57nr52b.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h128nf278</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anthropology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8g84mm772</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:24:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This paper will rather seek to uncover and emphasize Cold War  imperatives that served as significant guiding factors in shaping the Canadian  response to the Suez Crisis. The success of Canadian diplomacy in the 1956 Suez  Crisis was in the ability of Secretary of State for External Affairs Lester B.  Pearson and his Canadian colleagues to protect Western interests in the context of  the Cold War. Suez threatened Anglo-American unity, and the future of the North  Atlantic alliance. It also presented the Soviets an opportunity to gain influence in  the Middle East. The United Nations Emergency Force ensured that Britain and France  had a means to extricate themselves from the Crisis. Canada wished to further  protect Western credibility in the eyes of the non-white Commonwealth and Afro-Asian  bloc. It was, therefore, important to focus international attention on Soviet  aggression in Hungary, and not Anglo-French intervention in Egypt.</description><creator>Gafuik, Nicholas</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Canada -- Foreign relations -- 1945-</subject><subject>Egypt -- History -- Intervention, 1956</subject><subject>Canada -- Politics and government -- 1945-1980</subject><subject>Cold War</subject><title>More than a peacemaker : Canada's Cold War policy and the Suez Crisis, 1948-1956</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c247ds68c.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8g84mm772</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5x21tf758</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:24:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Cette étude a pour objectif d'évaluer la durabilité des projets karité dans la région centre-ouest du Burkina Faso. Le beurre de karité est un dérivé de l'arbre à karité, Vitellaria paradoxa, qui pousse dans la savane africaine. Les femmes de la région collectent et transforment les noix de karité en beurre pour leur consommation personnelle et pour la vente. Au regard de la demande globale croissante pour le beurre de karité, les donateurs et organisations non gouvernementales mettent en œuvre des ‘projets karité' visant à améliorer les revenus de ces femmes africaines appauvries. Ces projets favorisent l'intégration d'associations de productrices de beurre au sein de marchés internationaux, dont ceux du commerce équitable. Je démontre  que l'analyse approfondie des facteurs garantissant la durabilité de ces interventions est essentielle pour favoriser la mise en œuvre de projets et politiques permettant aux productrices des pays du Sud de bénéficier des garanties sociales et économiques promues par le commerce équitable. Le cadre conceptuel qui guide cette recherche s'appuie sur divers outils théoriques, dont l'écologie politique féministe, les savoirs écologiques traditionnels, les filières et les moyens de subsistance durables. La méthodologie repose sur l'observation, les entretiens semi directifs et non directifs, le classement par évaluation participative de la richesse, la cartographie et les mesures d'arbres à karité poussant dans 62 terrains, classés selon cinq types d'utilisation de la terre. Le travail de terrain fut mené auprès de participant(e)s Gurunsi, Moose et FulBe dans le village de Prata, le péri-urbain de Lan et la ville de Léo, situés dans la province de la Sissili. Cette thèse vise trois objectifs spécifiques. Le premier est d'analyser les pratiques de gestion et de conservation de l'arbre à karité en zone rurale et le rôle du genre dans ces processus.

Shea butter derives from the Vitellaria paradoxa tree, which grows in the semi-arid African savanna. Women living in this region have long collected and processed shea nuts into butter for household consumption and sale. Advocates for gender equality and sustainable development are thus pursuing the growing global demand for shea butter in the cosmetics industry to enhance the incomes of these impoverished female producers. Via ‘shea butter projects', international donors and non-governmental organisations are facilitating the integration of shea butter producers into international markets, including those based on Fair Trade. As I argue in this dissertation, an understanding of the sustainability prospects of these aid interventions is essential to develop projects and policies that maximize the benefits of Fair Trade for producer communities. Conceptually, the framework guiding my study draws upon scholarship on feminist political ecology, traditional ecological knowledge, commodity chains, and sustainable livelihoods. The methodology adopted involves observation, semi-structured and informal interviews, participatory wealth rankings, and shea tree mapping and measurements in 62 fields under five different types of land uses. Fieldwork was conducted among Gurunsi, Moose, and FulBe women and men in the rural village of Prata, the peri-urban village of Lan, and the town of Léo, which are located in the centre-west province of Sissili. My study addresses three specific objectives. The first is to investigate the nature of shea tree management and conservation in rural areas of the centre-west region of Burkina Faso, and the extent to which these are gendered. Findings related to this objective show that Gurunsi and Moose agriculturalists hold detailed knowledge of shea agroforestry that is not visibly differentiated according to gende</description><creator>Elias, Marlène</creator><contributor>Jon Unruh (Supervisor2)</contributor><contributor>Sarah Turner (Supervisor1)</contributor><date>2010</date><subject>Social Sciences - Geography</subject><title>Transforming nature's subsidy: Global markets, Burkinabè women and African shea butter</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rx913q29h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5x21tf758</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):43675</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
