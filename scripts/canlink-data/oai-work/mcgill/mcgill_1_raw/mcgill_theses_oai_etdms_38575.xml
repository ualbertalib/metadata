It involved the development of a 119-item questionnaire which was administered to a stratified sample of 60 users served by four organizational multidisciplinary teams. The data were collected through users' records via the MAB computer data base and face-to-face structured interviews. High levels of satisfaction were reported, both overall and for individual aspects of services; highest for the Early Intervention Program and lowest for User Empowerment. Older respondents were significantly more satisfied than younger respondents with general services. Younger and better educated users were found to be the least satisfied with the attention given to their questions and overall needs, and with the information provided. Low User Empowerment scores suggest that the Users' Committee may wish to explore various ways to communicate information.</description><creator>McGraw, Cathy.</creator><contributor>Duder, Sydney (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>People with visual disabilities -- Services for -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal Metropolitan Area.</subject><subject>Montreal Association for the Blind.</subject><subject>Social surveys -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal Metropolitan Area.</subject><title>Montreal Association for the Blind user satisfaction survey</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vh53wx83n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6108vd43z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mc87ps45q</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A critical analysis of the power issues for women in Protestant fundamentalism, using a feminist Foucauldian framework and Schoenherr's (1987) model of religious power. Protestant fundamentalism is a patriarchal, hierarchical system which can be oppressive, controlling women and their sexuality through the following strategies: (1) specific God-concepts and religious ideology; (2) tight, rigid group boundaries; (3) rules of the dominant discourse, and (4) technologies of discipline; all of which are also internalized by women, resulting in a highly effective means of control. Implications for social work practice include ethical issues and suggestions for intervention approaches, such as support groups, social networks, crisis counselling, use of the Internet and prevention, as well as possibilities for transforming a client's oppressive religious experience to one that is emancipatory. Suggestions for social work education and research are included.</description><creator>Straka, Silvia M.</creator><contributor>Leonard, Peter (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Urtnowski, Liesel (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Sex role -- Religious aspects -- Christianity.</subject><subject>Feminist therapy.</subject><subject>Oppression (Psychology)</subject><subject>Women in fundamentalist churches.</subject><subject>Social work with women.</subject><title>Religious power, fundamentalist women and social work practice</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sn00b083k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mc87ps45q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2514nn33t</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this study, two parallel themes will be explored. One is the counsellor's understanding of their own cultural identity and how this affects their practice with people of similar or different cultures than their own. Secondly, the study attempts to discover counselling skills that are most useful in working with members of the non-dominant culture. Data was collected from eight participants using two interview formats--a semi-structured interview guide and an unstructured interview design. Examination of this data yielded the following major themes: issues of counsellor's self identity, client's perceptions of counsellors, common practice issues, and cultural matching of counsellor and client. Important insights about counsellor's cultural self-identity and its relationship to practice were presented. No definitive cross-cultural practice skills were articulated, although many strategies for working with difference were addressed.</description><creator>Powell, Jennifer.</creator><contributor>Davies, Linda (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Leonard, Peter (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Cross-cultural counseling.</subject><subject>Social work with minorities.</subject><title>Cultural identities and cultural difference : issues of subjectivity and social work practice</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/736666536.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2514nn33t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cj82k918t</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>For many decades, tetrachloroethylene (PCE) has been used as a dry-cleaning solvent and as a degreaser. Owing to its improper storage and disposal, PCE has become one of the most widely detected pollutant in groundwaters. PCE has been classified as a potential threat to the environment and as a possible carcinogen to humans. It has been shown that PCE can be completely dechlorinated to non-toxic compounds under anaerobic conditions. In this study, the PCE treatment efficiency of two anaerobic fluidized bed reactors (AFBRs) were investigated and compared under different hydraulic loads. Granular activated carbon (GAC) and biolite were used as a support media in the first and second reactor, respectively. The results showed that the GAC AFBR achieved close to 100% PCE removal under all the loading conditions studied. Both adsorption and dechlorination accounted for this total PCE dechlorination. With the exception of one hydraulic loading, adsorption was the main PCE removal mechanism for the duration of this investigation for the GAC reactor. The maximum PCE removal efficiency achieved by the biolite$ rm sp{TM}$ AFBR was approximately 70%. Dechlorination was the only removal mechanism for this reactor. The highest specific chloride ion production rate for both reactors was achieved under the lowest loading condition and methanol activity. Very few metabolites were detected in the reactors' effluents showing that the chloride ion production was almost entirely due to the total dechlorination of PCE.</description><creator>Marcoux, Sébastien.</creator><contributor>Nicell, J.

The specimens, one constructed with normal-strength concrete and the other constructed with high-strength concrete, were designed as ductile moment-resisting frames such that the flexural strengths of the beams were similar. The increase in concrete strength allowed for some reduction of member sizes. The use of high-strength concrete for seismic design is restricted by the Canadian Standard, CSA A23.3-94, to members with a concrete compressive strength, f$ sbsp{ rm c}{ prime}$ less than or equal to 55 MPa. The applicability of the current design provisions to higher strength concrete exterior beam-column joints was investigated. Both specimens were instrumented to allow for detailed strain, load and deflection measurements to be monitored at critical locations during the testing process. The strain readings and crack patterns allowed a study of the flow of forces into the joint region. The measured strains on the slab bars permitted a determination of the amount of slab reinforcement which was contributing to the negative flexural capacity of the beam. This is of particular importance because the capacity of the beams will affect the hierarchy of yielding within a structure and may in turn give an undesirable sequence of yielding. The "effective width" specified in the current codes of practice is also examined.</description><creator>Marquis, Glenn M.</creator><date>1997</date><subject>Engineering, Civil.</subject><subject>Engineering, Materials Science.</subject><title>Effect of high-strength concrete on the seismic response of concrete frames</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9c67wp70z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v118rg43m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mc87ps460</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The dynamic optimization proposed in this work uses a linear programming technique to maximize the quantity of job orders processed on the machines at each constant job-mix stage. Priority factors guide the sequential allocation of partial and complete setups by ranking job/machine combinations in order of processing performance and capacity to meet due dates. The job allocation is governed by an algorithm which constitutes the backbone of the dispatching software that was developed and used to solve the examples presented in this thesis. Priority factors offer an effective mean of guiding the selection of setups by ranking job/machine combinations by processing speed and capacity to meet due times. The necessity for priority factors becomes more important as setup times increase in relation with quantities to be manufactured and the processing times. Priority factors also guide the allocation of partial setups on the machines to speed up job completion. The job allocation system has a substantial potential for providing shorter makespan than the Shortest Operating Time methodology by increasing machine utilization.</description><creator>Massicotte, Paul.</creator><contributor>Kups, Lucian (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><subject>Engineering, Industrial.</subject><subject>Applied Mechanics.</subject><title>Dynamic optimization of job allocation using constant job-mix stages and priority factors</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1c18dh714.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mc87ps460</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p8418q10r</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The behaviour of slab-column connections in flat plates is investigated. The first part of this thesis discusses six two-way slab-column specimens which were designed such that they would fail in punching shear. The parameters investigated were the placement of fibre-reinforced concrete in the slab and the concentration of slab reinforcement around the column. The effects of these parameters on the punching shear capacity, negative moment cracking, and stiffness of the two-way slab specimens were investigated. The second part of this thesis investigates the effects of the same parameters on six slab-column specimens and six column specimens without the surrounding slab for their ability to transmit axial loads from the high-strength concrete columns through the normal-strength concrete slab. Currently there is no beneficial effect in the CSA code for using fibre-reinforced concrete or concentrated slab reinforcement near the column in the calculation for the punching shear resistance or for the transmission of loads through slab-column connections. The beneficial effects of concentrating the slab reinforcement near the column and of using fibre-reinforced concrete are demonstrated.</description><creator>McHarg, Peter J.</creator><date>1997</date><subject>Engineering, Civil.</subject><subject>Engineering, Materials Science.</subject><title>Effect of fibre-reinforced concrete on the performance of slab-column specimens</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vd66w170h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p8418q10r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xg94hr45v</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Bone marrow toxicity imposes severe limitations on current cancer therapy. To test the feasibility of overcoming chemotherapy-induced hematopoietic suppression, the chemoresistance gene GST was transferred into hematopoietic progenitor cells using the bicistronic retrovirus vectors GIC and GID. As reported herein, GIC transduction of mouse hematopoietic cells resulted in increased in vitro resistance to mechlorethamine (up to 6-fold) and Ara-C (up to 9-fold). Likewise, transduction with GID bicistronic vector conferred increased resistance to mechlorethamine (up to 16-fold) and MTX (up to 12-fold). Furthermore, ex vivo pre-selection of GID-transduced cells was shown to double the fraction of TMTX-resistant progenitor cells. These results show that the retroviral transfer of GIC and GID confers in vitro resistance to nitrogen mustards, cytosine nucleoside analogs and antifolates, and forms an important basis for ongoing in vivo studies to evaluate the therapeutic value of this approach in cancer treatment.</description><creator>Shiu, Hoi ying, 1976-</creator><contributor>Cournoyer, Denis (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</subject><title>The use of bicistronic retroviral vectors to confer chemoprotection against alkylating drugs /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zc77sr750.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94hr45v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Human Genetics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1c18dh579</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>During the final stage of courtship, the garden snail Helix aspersa attempts to stab its mating partner with a mucus-coated calcareous "love dart." I present evidence supporting two predictions of the most promising hypothesis for the adaptive significance of this behavior: that the dart serves to increase the reproductive success of the shooter by increasing the numerical representation of its sperm in the recipient's storage organ (the sperm loading hypothesis). First, I demonstrate that once-mated snails store more of the sperm transferred by successful shooters than by unsuccessful shooters. Second, I demonstrate that this biased storage results in higher paternity scores for successful shooters relative to unsuccessful shooters in the clutches of multiply mated recipients. Moreover, I present evidence that body size and mating order influence the outcome of sperm competition in snails. Finally, I propose a novel mechanism to explain the observed pattern of sperm utilization in H. aspersa based on the motility of stored allosperm.</description><creator>Rogers, David W.</creator><contributor>Chase, Ronald (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Brown garden snail -- Sexual behavior</subject><subject>Brown garden snail -- Reproduction.</subject><title>Dart shooting and postcopulatory sexual selection in the garden snail Helix aspersa</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rv042v707.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1c18dh579</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z603r025f</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The relationship between precipitation and atmospheric vertical motion is investigated over the globe. By combining and averaging precipitation rates within small ranges of vertical motion, the mean precipitation rate is found to vary smoothly with vertical motion. The relationship is modelled with a simple function that assumes zero precipitation for subsidence and linearly increasing precipitation for ascending motion. Function parameters are computed from NCEP reanalysis data individually for every grid point and every calendar month. Variations in the slope account for geographical and seasonal variations in moisture and other precipitation factors. At each grid point, the scheme diagnoses precipitation rate from a single concurrent value of vertical motion. It is shown to have moderate skill over climatology in predicting mean monthly precipitation. Midlatitudes, oceans and the winter season are favoured. The scheme is designed to extract precipitation fields from a dry GCM. Application to climate modeling is discussed.</description><creator>Rose, Brian E. J.</creator><contributor>Lin, Charles A.

Two features of the neural response, response strength and response latency, can encode intensity. Therefore, binaural difference in spike-count and in latency can be used as sound localisation cues. In this work, I investigate the effects of ultrasound intensity and pulse-rate on sound localisation cues as well as the directionality of the response in an ultrasound-sensitive interneuron, AN2. I found that habituation, a decline in neural response, decreases binaural cues encoded in spike-count but increases the cues encoded in first-spike latency. In addition, binaural spike-count and latency difference encode the exact location of ultrasound pulses with similar reliability. As crickets are submitted to habituating stimuli in their natural environment, latency difference is a more useful cue than spike-count difference to locate an ultrasound, although comparison of these results with a previous study suggests that crickets use predominantly binaural difference in spike-count to localise ultrasound.</description><creator>Samson, Annie-Helene.</creator><contributor>Pollack, Gerald S.

When artificially recruited to a promoter, these components can stimulate gene expression. For example, fusion of known machinery components to the bacterial DNA binding domain (DBD) of LexA results in activation of test genes bearing a binding site for LexA. In a previous study, the coding region of the LexA DBD was fused to random bacterial DNA sequences and, surprisingly, 1% of all random sequences tested were able to activate transcription simply because they were negatively charged. By inserting the LexA site downstream of the transcriptional start site of our reporter genes, we predict that we will exclude these same negatively charged sequences, which do not have a specific role in transcription. The rationale is that at this location classical activators, which are negatively charged, cannot activate transcription. The ability of transcriptional machinery components to activate transcription from a downstream location, however, was demonstrated. In order to isolate transcriptional machinery components, we prepared a yeast genomic DNA library fused to DNA encoding the LexA DBD for transformation into a yeast strain containing reporters bearing a downstream LexA operator site. Using this system, we may isolate novel components of the transcriptional machinery as well as already identified components.

According to the leading theory in the field, the increase in serotonergic transmission is the final convergence point of currently prescribed antidepressant drugs. Pharmacological and electrophysiological studies have shown the essential role of the somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptor in the control of dorsal raphe 5-HT neuronal firing frequency and release; these characteristics make this receptor an extremely interesting target for adjuvant drugs that potentiate or even accelerate the effect of actual antidepressants molecules. In fact, augmentation of synaptic levels of 5-HT, thought to be necessary for the beneficial action of antidepressants in mood, does not immediately occur subsequent to acute administration of those molecules but depends on the desensitization of 5-HT1A somatodendritic autoreceptors located in the dorsal raphe, a phenomenom temporally correlated with the onset of action of all antidepressant classes.</description><creator>Richer, Maxime.</creator><contributor>Blier, Pierre (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Mental Health.</subject><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Characterization of the serotonergic and noradrenergic systems in mice lacking the 5-HTA receptor and its relevance to the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n870zs50q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8w32r7350</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gh93h130c</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Ten individuals of Cephalopholis cruentata, a marine serranid common on Caribbean coral reefs and important to artisanal reef fisheries, were implanted with acoustic transmitters on two reefs within the Soufriere Marine Management Area, St. Lucia. The mean home range area determined was 2120m2. Home range shape was non-circular, with a mean aspect ratio of 0.72. Neither home range size nor home range shape differed between the study sites or as a function of fish size. However, more active fish, as determined by movement per hour and displacement per hour, had larger home ranges. Use of space within the home range was characterised as activity rates (movement per hour), displacement rates (maximum distance between fish locations per hour), and preferential use of specific areas (% of position fixes in different areas). All fish demonstrated a clear preference for specific areas in their home range. Activity, displacement and % time spent in the preferred reef area were not correlated with fish size. Activity and displacement were higher by night than by day, and consistent with this, fish spent less time in their preferred home range area by night than by day. Given the home range size and movement patterns of C. cruentata determined in the study, the effectiveness of the marine reserve zones in the Soufriere Marine Management Area in protecting C. cruentata is assessed.</description><creator>Popple, Ian D.</creator><contributor>Hunte, Wayne (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Graysby -- Saint Lucia -- Geographical distribution.</subject><subject>Marine parks and reserves -- Saint Lucia.</subject><title>Application of ultrasonic telemetry to movement of the graysby Cephalopholis cruentata in a marine reserve in St. Lucia, W.I.</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h989r492j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gh93h130c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1r66j290b</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Background. Oral anticoagulants are associated with a decrease in bone mass density. Our study evaluates the association between an osteoporotic fracture and oral anticoagulants. Methods. We conducted a case-control study on subjects aged 70 years and older enrolled in the Quebec health insurance plan between 1992 and 1994. Incident cases of an osteoporotic fracture (index event) were identified by ICD-9 codes and surgical procedure codes. Exposure defined as one or more prescriptions of oral anticoagulants dispensed before the index event. Ten controls for each case, matched by age and date of index event, were selected. Results. Among 1,523 cases, 48 (3.2%) were exposed to oral an anticoagulant; among 15,205 controls, 461 (3.0%) were exposed (adjusted odds ratio: 1.1, 95% CI: 0.8--1.4). These negative results persisted after stratifying the exposure into the cumulative dose and duration of treatment. Conclusions. Oral anticoagulants are not significantly associated with an osteoporotic fracture in the elderly.</description><creator>Pilon, Danielle.</creator><contributor>Boivin, J.

The ischemic insult results in an interruption of blood flow to the central nervous system (CNS). Transient global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion is known to cause disruption of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and edema formation. Past investigations have indicated that following reperfusion, oxygen free radicals, superoxide in particular, are formed and played a major role in the development of neurological disorders and brain dysfunctions. The present first generation blood substitute consisting of a cross-linked hemoglobin (PolyHb) solution is useful for perfusing obstructed regions of vessels; however, this solution is not able to scavenge reactive oxygen radicals. Since our newly developed second-generation hemoglobin-based blood substitute, PolyHb cross-linked with superoxide dismutase and catalase (PolyHb-SOD-CAT), has the ability to scavenge reactive oxygen radicals, we hypothesize that this oxygen-carrying agent is able to deliver the required oxygen to brain tissue and remove the harmful oxygen free radicals in the same instance. In this investigation, we compare the physiological effects of this formulation with that of the first-generation hemoglobin-based blood substitute (PolyHb) on rat brain tissue using a 60-minutes transient global ischemia-reperfusion rat brain model. Comparative molecular distribution was performed to observe the cross-linking process. Verifications of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity and oxygen-carrying property of PolyHb-SOD-CAT were also conducted. Tracking of cerebral water contents and colorimetric assay of Evans blue influx into brain tissue were used to evaluate the integrity of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). This study shows that PolyHb-SOD-CAT can supply oxygen to ischemic tissues without causing reperfusion injury in a global stroke model.</description><creator>Powanda, Doi Douglas.</creator><contributor>Chang, Thomas M.

Although PTHRP has been identified as a factor responsible for malignancy-associated hypercalcemia, it is known to be widely expressed in normal tissues where it regulates cellular growth and differentiation. PTHRP binds with equal affinity and activates the membrane-embedded G protein-coupled PTH/PTHRP receptor present on the surface of target cells such as bone and kidney. Upon receptor binding several signaling pathways are activated including the adenylyl cyclase and the phospholipase C pathways. A number of growth factors and steroid hormones have previously been shown to regulate PTHRP production. To study the regulation of PTHRP by androgens, we used a late stage human prostate cancer cell line that is androgen non-responsive, PC-3 cells. In addition, we used an androgen responsive cell line, transfected with a functional androgen receptor, PC-3T cells. Results obtained by Northern blots and immunoradiometric assays demonstrated that androgens inhibit PTHRP expression in this human prostate cancer system. Male Balb/c nu/nu mice, injected subcutaneously with PC-3 cells, developed larger tumors than experimental animals inoculated with PC-3T cells. Moreover, castration of the host animals resulted in the substantial increased in PC-3T tumor volumes. Immunohistochemical studies indicated that PTHRP expression was inhibited in experimental PC-3T tumors and that castration of animals increased PTHRP production. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that androgens down regulate PTHRP production in prostate cancer cells in vitro and that prostate tumor cells producing less PTHRP exhibited a reduction in tumor volume in vivo.</description><creator>Pizzi, Helena.</creator><contributor>Goltzman, David (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>The regulation of patathyroid hormone related peptide (PTHRP) gene expression by androgens in prostate cancer /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gb19f773q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cc08hh351</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0p096891r</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:34Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Objective. This study was designed to assess the association between cardiovascular disease and the use of antihypertensive drugs in a diabetic population. Design and setting. We conducted a case-control study nested within a cohort of 2499 subjects over 45 years old with diabetes and hypertension in Saskatchewan. Outcomes. The main outcome measure was first hospitalization for cardiovascular disease. Exposure definition. The main exposure of interest was current use of antihypertensive drugs, defined as drug dispensing within 90 days of the index date. Statistical analysis. Relative risks were calculated with 95% confidence intervals using conditional logistic regression models. Full multivariate models, adjusting for all potential confounding covariates, were performed. Results. Compared with diuretics, current use of calcium antagonists was associated with a 1.90-fold increase in risk of cardiovascular disease (RR 1.90; 95% Cl = 1.25--2.91). The current use of beta-blockers was not associated with an increase in morbidity. The risk of cardiovascular disease for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) relative to diuretics was found to be increased only in the subgroup of patients currently exposed to other antihypertensive drugs, including peripheral vasodilators, centrally-acting alpha 2 agonists, and a-blockers (RR 1.6; 95% Cl = 1.19--2.18). Conclusion. Results of this research agree with the findings from several observational studies and clinical trials. However, factors influencing selective prescribing practices could not be completely accounted for and may partially explain our results.</description><creator>Pietrangelo, Maria G.</creator><contributor>Suissa, Samy (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</subject><title>Antihypertensive therapy and risk of cardiovascular disease in diabetic subjects</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dn39x316f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0p096891r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9306t091x</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:34Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The incorporation of organometallic motifs into dendrimers offers significant potential in building macromolecular species with desired properties for heterogenizing homogeneous catalysis. To this end, poly-phosphorus monomers O=P[O(CH 2)3PPh2]3, P[O(CH2) nPPh2]3, PhP[O(CH2)nPPh 2]2 (where n = 3, 10) were prepared, and their complexation chemistry with [mup-Cl)(1,5-C8H12)Rh]2 was examined. It led a new route to contruct multimetallic compounds, in which the evolving structure is controlled by the phosphorus units yielding either typical spherical or non-spherical macromolecules. Selected polymetallic complexes formed using these poly-phosphorus ligands were found to be active catalysts for olefin hydrogenation. A novel divergent synthetic route to starburst dendritic structures was also developed by preparing monomers such as Si[O(CH2 )nPPh2]4, MeSi[O(CH2) nPPh2]3 (where n = 3, 10, 16), and Me2Si[O(CH 2)nPPh2]2 (where n = 3, 10). They were then linked with transition metals to produce starburst organometallic dendrimers Si[O(CH 2)nPPh2Ni(CO)2PPh3] 4, MeSi[O(CH2)nPPh2Ni(CO)2PPh 3]3 (where n = 3, 10, 16), Me2Si[O(CH2) nPPh2Ni(CO)2PPh3]2 (where n = 3, 10) and Si[O(CH2)nPPh2RhCl(1,5-COD)] 4, MeSi[O(CH2)nPPh2RhCl(1,5-COD)] 3 (where n = 3, 10, 16) Me2Si[O(CH2)nPPh 2RhCl(1,5-COD]2 (where n = 3, 10).</description><creator>Peori, M.

An acquisition sequence capable of acquiring up to 9 slices was designed and implemented into two final pulse sequences: an interleaved perfusion/BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) sequence and a perfusion-only sequence. A number of practical imaging issues were addressed and resolved, including the design of an appropriate inversion pulse for labelling of arterial spins, spatial offsetting of this pulse for use in the arterial spin labelling technique chosen for implementation, and the design of various saturation pulses necessary for quantification of the technique. Experimental validation of the quantitative multi-slice perfusion technique was performed by measuring visual cortex cerebral blood flow (CBF) values in a group of 8 subjects using a block-design visual stimulus paradigm. Results indicated good sequence stability and CBF measurements agreed well with quantitative values found in the literature.</description><creator>Petric, Martin Peter.</creator><contributor>Pike, G.

Examination of sequence variation suggests that the gene family consists of three or four members. Compared with GapC in Arabidopsis thaliana, the GapC locus in A. spectabilis has at least two fewer introns and one intron that is double in length. Strong purifying selection was detected at each putative locus since the divergence of the Amsinckia spectabilis lineage from species in the allied family Solanaceae. Mean nucleotide diversity across all observed loci is 0.0036 for the inbreeding variety spectabilis, and 0.0049 for the outbreeding variety microcarpa . Outbreeding populations were systematically more diverse than inbreeding populations at GapC-IV. These results are discussed in the context of theory for the fate of duplicate genes, and the background selection hypothesis.</description><creator>Pérusse, Joëlle R.</creator><contributor>Schoen, Daniel J.

A research effort of 6511 hours at sea yielded 849 sightings of blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus), 5291 of finback whales (Balaenoptera physalus), 3822 of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and 6489 of minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata). Spatial and behavioural data were collected at sea using inflatable boats, and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) were used to obtain accurate positions. These data were plotted and analysed using a Geographic Information System (GIS) to test the hypotheses that patterns of distribution were not random, were associated with bathymetry and reflected specific differences in habitat use. The resulting maps illustrated the clustered distribution of rorqual whales linked to sea-bottom topography, probably associated with areas of local upwelling and increased productivity. Blue and fin whales shared almost the same distribution, humpback whales were found in slightly deeper, offshore waters whereas minke whales were more abundant in shallower waters. Little attention has been given until now to local patterns of distribution in the area and such information can be useful for practical management considerations. The results emphasise the importance of scale in ecological studies of marine mammals and the need for further research using additional oceanographic parameters, in order to better understand habitat selection.</description><creator>Doniol-Valcroze, Thomas.</creator><contributor>Titman, R.

Fast Monte Carlo algorithms are accurate in general but their clinical implementation needs validation. Calculations of electron beam dose distributions performed using the fast Monte Carlo system XVMC and the well-benchmarked general-purpose Monte Carlo code EGSnrc were compared with measurements. Irradiations were performed using the 9 MeV and 15 MeV beams from the Clinac 18 accelerator with standard conditions. Percent depth doses and lateral profiles were measured with thermoluminescent dosimeter and electron diode respectively. The accelerator was modelled using EGS4/BEAM, and using an experiment-based beam model. All measurements were corrected by EGSnrc calculated stopping power ratios. Overall, the agreement between measurement and calculation is excellent. Small remaining discrepancies can be attributed to the non-equivalence between physical and simulated lung material, precision in energy tuning, beam model parameters optimisation and detector fluence perturbation effects.</description><creator>Doucet, Robert.</creator><contributor>Seuntjens, Jan P.

This work investigates the effect of anti-migraine serotonin (5-HT) receptor agonists (the triptans) on in vivo 5-HT synthesis rates in the brain. In rats, rates are examined after acute and chronic drug administration. In humans, rates are measured in different migrainous conditions, namely, during a headache, after sumatriptan, and between attacks. Methods. Synthesis rates are determined using the alpha-[14C or 11C]methyl- L-tryptophan tracer kinetic model, combined in rats with autoradiography and in humans with positron emission tomography. Results &amp; conclusions . Acute triptan administration reduces 5-HT synthesis rates in rat brain while chronic delivery increases rates at serotonergic projection areas. Preliminary results in human migraine sufferers suggest a trend, though not significant, towards an acute decrease in central rates after sumatriptan injection and higher rates during migraine pain than between attacks. Such central effects might or might not help alleviate pain but would have repercussions for chronic triptan users.</description><creator>Dobson, Colin.</creator><contributor>Hamel, Edith (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</subject><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Effect of anti-migraine 5-HTBDF receptor agonists on In Vivo serotonin synthesis rates in rat and human brain</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pn89d837f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/70795949c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):38600</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
