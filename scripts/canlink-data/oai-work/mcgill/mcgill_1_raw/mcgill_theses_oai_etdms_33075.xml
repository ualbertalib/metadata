One goal of Universal Grammar (Chomsky 1957, 1965) is to account for the systematic patterns which are attested across languages. Toward this end, Universal Grammar is considered to contain a set of phonological primitives such as features, and some restrictions on their combination. However, in rule-based phonology, it is assumed that rules are part of the grammar of an individual language. By their very nature, rules describe operations. As such, they are not well-suited to express restrictions on the ways in which segments may combine when no overt operation is involved. To account for such restrictions, Chomsky &amp; Halle (Sound Pattern of English (SPE): 1968) supplemented rules with Morpheme Structure Constraints (MSCs) which define the possible morpheme shapes that a particular language allows (see also Halle 1959). Thus, in SPE, both MSCs and rules played a role in accounting for the phonological patterns observed in languages.</description><creator>Kawasaki, Takako, 1968-</creator><contributor>Good, Heather (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Piggott, G.

Various models are proposed by investigators of development and social change to meet these challenges. However, such models are inevitably associated with particular patterns of culture and values. It must therefore be recognized that development cannot be value-free and measured only in economic terms or based on European standards; rather development must be value-laden and correspond with a nation's history, culture and aspirations. At the same time, few development models have dealt with the dimension of culture and values. Dissatisfied with Western models of development, Muslim thinkers have attempted to build an Islamic model which expresses Islamic values and aspirations. In this thesis I explore and design a model based on the writings of Ayatullah Sayyid Muḥammad Baqir al-Ṣadr, whose thought seems particularly comprehensive and relevant to the modern world. My discussion begins with a synthesis and critique of a variety of Western models, both modern and post-modern, from an Islamic point of view. I then investigate and discuss Sadr's theory of culture and values development, focusing on the challenge of human inner conflict and his typology of human values formation. Sadr's key concern is to shift the focus of development from a macro-social to the micro-individual level. An Islamic model of development, as Sadr sets out, is first and foremost one for human values development. For Sadr, culture and values development must precede any other kind of development for a Muslim society, where the practice of Islamic values is a way of life and a journey towards God. Values education then should be prophetic education which focuses on teaching people how to develop themselves and accordingly to reach God. Sadr also argues that economic development cannot be obtained without the establishment of social justice. The establishment of the latter should be based on culture and values development, which profoundly relates to the resolution of human inner values conflicts. The project also evaluates different models in the light of the one proposed by Sadr, and discusses numerous challenges and dilemmas facing Islamic societies in the global environment and in the post-modern questioning of permanent values. Next, I will examine gender and development, an important issue not explicitly addressed by Sadr. In this chapter, I have indicated that sexual values development is of critical importance to the success of any development program, which in turn depends upon a sexuality education that teaches God-centered self-control. I will close this dissertation with a chapter examining some of the educational challenges posed by culture and values development in Post-Revolutionary Iran.</description><creator>Shameli, Abbas Ali.</creator><contributor>Lin, Jing (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Ṣadr, Muḥammad Bāqir.</subject><subject>Islamic ethics.</subject><title>Toward an Islamic model of culture &amp; values development : a study of Sadr's theory</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4j03d164g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fj236383k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Culture and Values in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:79407z89p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:36:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis presents some novel organosilane reactions catalyzed by titanocenes. Heterodehydrocoupling between silanes and phosphines has been accomplished with titanocenes, as catalysts. The reaction has the characteristics of high yield and high selectivity and can be carried out under mild conditions. Monophosphinosilanes and diphosphinosilanes can be selectively obtained from the reactions of secondary phosphines andsilanes. Primary phosphines react with primary silanes to produce 1,3,5-triphospha-2,4,6-trisilacyclohexanes. A two-catalytic-cycled mechanism is proposed with titanocene hydride as the key catalytic species. Hydrosilation/hydrogenation of some aromatic N-heterocycles (namely pyridine, 3-picoline, 4-picoline, 3,5-lutidine, and quinoline) has been achieved with titanocene derivatives as catalysts. A variety of hydrosilated/hydrogenated products, either fully or partially saturated, may be produced depending on conditions. A reaction mechanism is proposed based on isolated and structurally characterized pyridine titanocene complexes, on the effects of substituent on the rates, and on H/D exchange studies. It is suggested that a key step in the hydrogenation/hydrosilation reaction is the formation of a mono-eta 1(N) complex between the pyridine ring and the titanocene silyl complex. It is proposed that the rate determining step is an intramolecular insertion of -N=C- into the Ti-Si bond. If the strong coordination or the intramolecular insertion is prohibited by either steric effects or electronic effects, or if the complex is of too high stability, no hydrogenation/hydrosilation product is obtained. Extensive H/D exchange at the 2- and 6-positions of the pyridine is attributed to a reversible ortho-metallation of pyridine in a Ti-H complex. Cp2TiMe2 catalyzed hydrosilation/hydrogenation reactions of nicotinates, ethyl benzoate, and lactones have been studied. With ethyl nicotinate as the substrate, the hydrosilation occurs on the ring to give ethyl N-(methylphenylsilyl)-1,6-dihydronicotinate as the only product. No reaction at the ester group is observed. However, when the substrate is ethyl isonicotinate, ethyl 2-methylnicotinate or ethyl 6-methylnicotinate, the hydrosilation/hydrogenation only occurs at the ester groups and the carboalkoxy group is tranformed into either a silyl ether group or an alkyl group. Copolymers can be produced from the titanocene catalyzed ring opening hydrosilation/hydrogenation reactions of lactones and PhMeSiH2. A key intermediate in these reactions, Cp[mu-(eta1:eta 5-C5H4)](THF)Ti(mu-H)TiCp 2, is isolated and well characterized by x-ray crystallography. The successful isolation and characterization of this product provides the first direct evidence to support the involvement of Cp2Ti in numerous Cp2TiMe2 catalyzed reactions in addition to correcting an earlier incorrect assignment of the structure of this frequently cited compound.</description><creator>Shu, Ronghua, 1962-</creator><contributor>Harrod, John F.

The schedules were typical of the processing of Nb microalloyed, multiply-alloyed and plain C-Mn steels. The calculations, based on the Sims analysis, take into account work roll flattening, redundant strain and the forward slip ratio. The measured stresses are then compared with the predictions of a model based on an improved Misaka mean flow stress equation, in which solute effects, strain accumulation, as well as the kinetics of static and metadynamic recrystallization are fully accounted for. Good agreement between the measured and predicted mean flow stresses is obtained over the whole range of rolling temperatures. The evolution of grain size and the fractional softening are also predicted by the model during all stages of strip rolling. Special attention was paid to the Nb steels, in which the occurrence of Nb(C,N) precipitation strongly influences the rolling behaviour, preventing softening between passes. The present study leads to the conclusion that Mn addition retards the strain-induced precipitation of Nb. By contrast, Si addition has an accelerating effect. The model calculates the critical strain for the onset of dynamic recrystallization in Nb steels. It shows that the critical strain/peak strain ratio decreases with increasing Nb content, and that Mn and Si have marginal but opposite effects. It is demonstrated that dynamic recrystallization followed by metadynamic recrystallization occurs under most conditions of hot strip rolling, during the initial passes due to the high strains, low strain rates and high temperatures, or in the final passes as a consequence of strain accumulation.</description><creator>Siciliano, Fulvio.</creator><contributor>Jonas, John J.

Agricultural production systems, income, socio-economic status, morbidity, diet and protein-energy status were compared between a group of quinoa-producers and a randomly sampled quasi-control group of non-quinoa-producers (total n = 90 households) over four study rounds (pre- and post-quinoa-harvest). Seasonal and age-related variability in nutrient intakes as well as anthropometric status provided evidence of nutritional vulnerability in this population. Post-menopausal women (50+ years of age) consumed less energy (300 calories), less protein (11 g) and maintained a lower mean body weight (3.66 kg) compared to their younger counterparts. Seasonal changes in dietary quality and anthropometric status were apparent for women of all ages with less protein and micronutrients consumed post-harvest and mean arm circumference 6 cm smaller. Marked prevalences of inadequate intakes of many of these same nutrients (including iron, niacin, and vitamin B12) were demonstrated with the Probability Method. Correlates of diet quantity (energy), quality (animal protein adjusted for energy) and anthropometric status were established. By means of a Principal Components analysis, socio-economic status was shown to be comprised of two unique constructs: modern lifestyle and farming wealth. Both factors were related to diet quality but neither was related to diet quantity. Diet quality, in turn, was significantly related to anthropometric status in multivariate models. Women in quinoa-producing households consumed higher amounts of most nutrients and maintained larger arm protein-energy stores than those in non-quinoa-producing families. Trends were similar in children with no evidence of a difference in anthropometric status. However, quinoa-producers scored higher on both scales of socio-economic status, demonstrating self-selection bias. In multivariate models, quinoa production was related to increased intakes of energy, iron, zinc and folate but effects on animal protein intake and anthropometric status were confounded by the socio-economic effects. Therefore, while quinoa production was associated with positive nutritional impacts, the most impoverished households were left virtually untouched by this agricultural opportunity.</description><creator>Macdonald, Barbara A.</creator><contributor>Johns, Timothy (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Quinoa -- Ecuador.</subject><subject>Rural women -- Ecuador -- Social conditions.</subject><subject>Rural women -- Ecuador -- Economic conditions.</subject><subject>Rural women -- Ecuador -- Nutrition.</subject><title>Socio-economic correlates of rural women's nutrition : the special case of re-introducing quinoa in Ecuador</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9p290c22f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zk51vj436</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p5547t20r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:36:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Fibrinogen (Fg) mediates platelet aggregation and adhesion to artificial surfaces by interacting with its receptor, glycoprotein IIb and IIIa complex (GPIIbIIIa, or integrin alphaIIbbeta 3), on the platelet membrane. Considerable evidence has demonstrated that the (H12) on the gamma chain carboxyl terminus is required for the binding of Fg from solution to activated platelet GPIIbIIIa, while the RGD sites, the universal integrin recognition domain on adhesive ligands, are not involved. In this study, using recombinant Fg, well-defined Fg plasmin digestion fragments, and specific monoclonal anit-Fg antibodies, we demonstrated that the same sequence, the H12, or more precisely, the AGDV on the extreme carboxyl terminus of the gamma chain (gamma408--411), is also required for platelet-bound Fg to support platelet aggregation (crosslinking), thus experimentally verifying the "two sticky ends" theory of Fg-mediated platelet aggregation The RGD-containing domains on the Aalpha chains are not involved in aggregation. The AGDV sequence on the gamma chain carboxyl terminus is also necessary and sufficient for activated platelets to adhere to surface-adsorbed Fg, while the RGD sequences we similarly not required. A receptor induced binding site (RIBS), the Fg RIBS-I site (gamma373--385), on Fg either bound to its GPIIbIIIa-receptor or on a surface, is not directly involved in interactions between platelet GPIIbIIIa and immobilized Fg. The inhibitory effects of the anti-Fg-RIBS-I antibody are due to steric hindrance of the accessibility of the AGDV site to platelet GPIIbIIIa. Thus, the extreme carboxyl terminus of the gamma chain is the only site in both fluid and solid phase Fg that is involved in platelet GPIIbIIIa-Fg interactions. Though resting platelets are able to adhere to surface-bound Fg, this adhesion efficiency is much lower than that of the adhesion of the activated platelets. The adhesion efficiency of both resting and activated platelets to surface-adsorbed Fg decreases with increasing shear rate from 100 s -1 to 2,000 s-1. However, the decrease of the adhesion efficiency of the resting platelets is more marked than the decrease of the adhesion efficiency of the activated ones. Thus, the higher the shear rates, the larger the difference in the adhesion efficiencies between resting and activated platelets. However, due to the higher collision frequencies at higher shear rates, the adhesion of resting platelets was maintained at a similar level from shear rates of 300--2,000 s-1, while the adhesion of activated platelets kept increasing from 100 s -1 to 2,000 s-1. These data indicate that platelet activation is an efficient regulation pathway for platelet adhesion to surfaces.</description><creator>Liu, Qingde, 1963-</creator><contributor>Frojmovic, Mony M.

A number of Fe(III) organic complexes are reduced, including siderophores---effective Fe chelates produced by microorganims in response to Fe stress. Reduction rates are inversely related to the relative stability constants of the oxidized and reduced Fe chelates (log Kox/Kred), and vary by a factor of 2.4 in accordance with theoretical predictions. Under Fe-limiting conditions, reduction rates increase and the ability of T. oceanica to transport Fe from siderophores is enhanced. Iron bound to the siderophore desferrioxamine B (DFB) is reduced 2 times faster than it is taken up, suggesting that the reductase is well coupled to the Fe transporter, and can provide all the inorganic Fe to account for the measured Fe uptake rates in the presence of excess DFB. The efficacy of the reductase in providing inorganic Fe for uptake and growth is ultimately dependent on the relative concentrations of excess ligands in solution and cell surface Fe transporters competing for inorganic Fe. The rates of Fe reduction and uptake are twice as fast in cells grown in NO3- compared to those grown in NH 4+, suggesting a link with cellular N metabolism and with NO3- utilization in particular. Enhanced Fe reductase activity in NO3--grown cells enables them to maintain a 1.6-fold higher cellular Fe concentration under low Fe conditions. Experiments conducted in the subarctic Pacific, an Fe-limited oceanic region, demonstrated that even indigenous plankton (both prokaryotic and eukaryotic plankton) have the ability to acquire Fe bound to strong organic chelates. Large phytoplankton species (&gt;3 mum) reduce Fe bound to siderophores extracellularly. Because the predominant form of dissolved Fe in the sea is bound to strong organic complexes, a reductive mechanism as described here may be a critical step in Fe acquisition by phytoplankton.</description><creator>Maldonado-Pareja, Maria Teresa.</creator><contributor>Price, Neil (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Thalassiosira.</subject><subject>Iron -- Physiological transport.</subject><subject>Iron -- Metabolism.</subject><subject>Marine phytoplankton.</subject><subject>Biogeochemical cycles.</subject><title>Iron acquisition by marine phytoplankton</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4q77ft08p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sf268684c</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6d56zz27d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:36:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The detection of visual stimuli involves neurons which are selectively responsive to components of a visual scene. In the early stages of visual processing, it is commonly accepted that neurons respond to the changes in luminance associated with objects and object boundaries. However, recent experiments have demonstrated that some neurons can also respond to features which are not defined by luminance variations. These features are termed "second-order" because they require more complex processing, and neurons which respond to second-order features are necessarily nonlinear. In this thesis, I undertook a three dimensional physiological characterization (i.e. tuning of orientation, spatial frequency and temporal frequency) of such nonlinear neurons in order to shed light on their processing capabilities. In particular we sought to address the following issues: (1) whether the temporal and spatial properties underlying second-order motion are similar to those underlying luminance based ("first-order") motion; (2) whether these properties remain constant using different types of second-order stimuli, suggesting that neurons' responses are invariant to the physical attributes comprising the stimulus; and (3) whether second-order processing is a cortical mechanism or can occur at an earlier stage of the visual system (e.g. in the lateral geniculate nucleus). Taken together these results have a dual function; they provide insight into the complex cellular processing of higher order features, and they provide a general framework for the generation of second-order models.</description><creator>Mareschal, Isabelle.</creator><contributor>Baker, Curtis L.

The method, mainly text-oriented, that is to say turning away from the sociological approach, offers a semiotic reading of the text, both original and translated (Chapter 1). This semiotic approach considers the text as a significant mosaic. Thus, it brings out not only the motivation of the different textual elements, but also the coherence cementing them. The analysis of the original text (Chapter 2) shows that the subversive aesthetic and ideological function of Black English is provided by Jim's characterization and his discursive and narrative programs. William-Little Hughes's translation (1886), as well a Claire Laury's (1979) and Rene and Yolande Surleau's (1950), reverse the subversive project of the source-text through an organized system of textual transformations (additions, omissions, shifts) and produce a stereotyped version of Jim's character, his speech, also simplified and reduced, becoming the expression of this characterization (Chapter 3). Poles apart from these three texts, the French versions written by Suzanne Netillard (1948), Andre Bay (1961), Lucienne Molitor (1963), Jean La Graviere (1979) and Helene Costes (1980) display translation projects which reactivate the original system in which Jim had a multidimensional characterization (Chapter 4).

These theories are: the counting of minimal units, such as poetic feet, stresses or syllables, practiced in various forms since antiquity, and recently employed by D. N. Freedman, F. M. Cross and others, the analysis of poetic line-forms proposed by Terence Collins, the syntactic structural analysis proposed by M. O'Connor, and the semantic analysis practiced by Willow van der Meer, Johannes de Moor and a group of scholars associated with the Kampen School of Theology. All of these theories purport to identify and explain the fundamentals of biblical Hebrew verse structure. Each of these theories is presented comprehensively. These presentations include a review of literature relevant to the field of Hebrew verse structure studies in general, and to these four current theories of verse structure in particular. These four theories are applied to four poetic passages from the Hebrew Bible: Judges 5:2--31, Isaiah 5:1--7, Lamentations 1 and Psalm 126. These applications show how each of these theories describes the verse structure of each of the poems. Following this, the theories and their applications to these passages are compared to determine which, if any, of these theories are effective in distinguishing poetry from prose, distinguishing one poem from another, predicting the form of a poem, and prescribing rules for the composition of poetry. The strengths and weaknesses of each theory are identified. In addition, the reasons for the failure of these theories to provide an adequate description of the verse structure of biblical Hebrew poetry are indicated.</description><creator>Leatherman, Donn Walter.</creator><contributor>Culley, Robert C.

As a corollary, we obtain a description of tensor completion for groups of the form F/ N', in particular, free solvable groups. The tensor completion GQ of a torsion-free hyperbolic group over the field of rational numbers can be similarly described in terms of free constructions. Using this description of G Q, in the second part of this thesis we provide an algorithm that decides whether a finite system of equations over G Q is solvable, and if it is, finds a solution. In the third part of this thesis we study residual properties of Lyndon's group FZx (the free exponential group over the ring of integral polynomials Z[x]), whose structure also involves free constructions. We show that FZx is conjugately residually free, i.e., it is possible to map FZx to a free group preserving the nonconjugacy of two elements.</description><creator>Lioutikova, Ekaterina.</creator><contributor>Kharlampovich, Olga (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Mathematics.</subject><title>Algorithmic and approximation problems in free constructions</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3j3334033.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9z903161m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:db78td85v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:36:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis contains a description of centroids, or maximal rings of scalars, for the class of CSA-groups, including free, universally free, and torsion-free hyperbolic groups.

The detectors consist of a double-emulsion portal film secured between plates of aluminum, copper, brass or lead with thicknesses from 0 to 4.81 mm. The study of MTF, NPS, and DQE shows that both photons and secondary electrons produced within the front-plate and backscattered electrons from the back-plate affect metal/film portal imaging. Study of DQE indicates that the best portal detectors are those without back-plates, and with high density front-plates with thicknesses less than the maximum electron range. This MTF data was modeled with the logit analysis. It is shown that the parameters resulting from the logit analysis depend on the mass thickness and the atomic number of the metal plates. Metal/amorphous selenium (a-Se) electrostatic-based detectors have been developed for portal imaging. The detectors consist of a-Se photoconductive layers of varied thicknesses deposited on plates of varying thicknesses of aluminum, copper, and stainless steel. The metal-plates of the detectors face the incident 6 MV and Co-60 photon spectra during imaging. The sensitivity of the a-Se detectors to dose, electric field across the a-Se layer, plate type, and a-Se thickness is studied. A model showing a cubic relationship between the a-Se latent surface voltage and dose is derived and experimentally verified. A contrast-detail phantom is used to study the image quality and contrast-resolution characteristics of the metal/a-Se detectors. The metal/a-Se detectors produce better quality contrast-detailed images at a considerably lower dose than that offered by the other commercial available portal systems, mainly due to the low inherent noise of the novel detectors. A semi-automatic technique for the direct set-up alignment of radiosurgical circular fields from an isocentric linac to treatment room laser cross-hairs is described. Because film or a-Se is each sensitive to laser and ionizing radiation, they are used to acquire images of the positioning lasers superimposed directly onto the radiosurgical circular fields. An algorithm extracts the coordinates of the center of the collimator image and of the intersection of the laser cross-hair image and subsequently determines the deviation, to within a precision of ~0.04 mm. The technique is also used to perform quality assurance on a Clinac-18 linac and shows a (0.53 +/- 0.05) mm wobble from the nominal isocenter of the linac.</description><creator>Falco, Tony.</creator><contributor>Fallone, B.

Such "less than optimal use" includes use of long-acting benzodiazepines, use of high daily doses and long-term continuous use. Most previous research on factors associated with these types of use has been carried out using administrative databases containing limited patient information. The objectives of this study were to assess the extent of these less than optimal uses among Quebec seniors and to evaluate the effects of patient and prescriber factors through examination of a research data base containing patient characteristics linked to an administrative data base containing prescription drug records. Study subjects were 1423 community-dwelling Quebec adults age 66 and older who participated in the first phase of the Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA1). Demographic and health data from CSHA1 were linked to prescriptions billed to the Regie de l'assurance maladie du Quebec (RAMQ). One hundred and eighty-two (12.8%) subjects filled at least one prescription for a long-acting benzodiazepine within 365 days following CSHA1 screening (standardized one-year period prevalence 12.4%). Use of long-acting benzodiazepines was associated with male patient gender, earlier physician graduation and physician specialty status. In addition, relationships between use of long-acting benzodiazepines and physician factors were modified by patient anxiety. One hundred and eight subjects (7.6%) filled at least one high dose prescription (standardized one-year prevalence 7.9%). High dose use was associated with patient age and anxiety. Physician specialist status was a risk factor for use of high daily doses among subjects with cognitive impairment but a protective factor among subjects without cognitive impairment. The standardized one-year prevalence of long-term continuous use was 19.8% The one-year cumulative incidence of initiation of such use was 1.9%. Long-term continuous use was associated with increasing age. This study confirmed that these three less than optimal uses of benzodiazepines occur relatively frequently among community-dwelling Quebec seniors. Both patient and prescriber determinants appear to play a role in such use, and patient factors may alter the relationship between less than optimal use and prescriber characteristics.</description><creator>Egan, Mary Yvonne.</creator><contributor>Wolfson, Christina (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacy.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</subject><subject>Gerontology.</subject><title>Less than optimal uses of benzodiazepines by older adults in Quebec</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6w924d44f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rx913r57w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:47429b93x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:36:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study examined the effect of choristers' vocal production and seating arrangement on evaluations of choral blend and overall choral sound. Two singing modes were studied: (1) "soloistic" singing, in which choristers attempted to maintain normal solo vocal production; and (2) "blended" singing, in which choristers tried to maximize homogeneity of ensemble sound. Seating arrangements examined were: (1) random sectional seating, and (2) sectional seating according to "acoustic matching" of voices Crossing the 2 factors produced 4 experimental conditions. An ad hoc choir, composed of 22 university voice majors, was recorded singing 4 choral pieces under each experimental condition. Thirty-seven choral conductors, 33 voice teachers and 32 nonvocal musicians rated the performances according to 7 standard evaluative criteria, and wrote comments. Eight of the choristers were recorded individually during the performances. These choristers was also recorded singing their parts as solo songs. Twelve voice teachers evaluated the vocal production of these a choristers. They ranked the 5 performances of each piece (4 choral and solo) by each chorister, and wrote comments. All choristers rated the 4 choral experimental conditions for each piece on a 5-point scale, according to vocal comfort and choral sound, and wrote comments. Analysis of choral performance ratings revealed a significant seating arrangement effect in favor of acoustic seating over random seating. Singing mode had a significant effect in favor of blended singing over soloistic singing on choral conductors' ratings for all seven criteria. This effect was observed in the voice teachers only "blend/homogeneity." Otherwise, no significant singing mode effect was voice teachers and nonvocal musicians. On the basis of individual vocal production, voice teachers ranked solo singing significantly higher than the 2 choral singing modes, and soloistic choral singing higher than blended choral singing. Moreover, they ranked acoustic seating higher than random seating. Choristers rated acoustic seating higher than random seating for vocal comfort and choral sound. They preferred blended singing to soloistic singing for choral sound. For vocal comfort, sopranos preferred soloistic singing to blended singing, tenors preferred blended singing to soloistic singing. Altos and basses showed no singing mode preference for vocal comfort.</description><creator>Ekholm, Elizabeth.</creator><contributor>Wapnick, Joel (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Choral singing.</subject><title>The effect of singing mode and seating arrangement on choral blend and overall choral sound /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8s45qb56h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/47429b93x</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ng451k32p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:36:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The azimuthal distributions of charged particles produced in Au+Au collisions at 11.5 A· GeV/c have been analyzed relative to the reaction plane orientation using the E877 experimental setup at the AGS. Details of the calibration procedures, data reduction and analysis methods are presented. With the event-by-event reconstruction of the reaction plane, a Fourier expansion is used to describe the anisotropy in particle distribution. Directed and elliptic flows are quantified by the dipole and quadrupole Fourier coefficients. A method allowing the decoupling of these two effects is introduced. Elliptic flow signals of protons, deuterons, pi +, pi--, K+, K-- have been studied as a function of particle rapidity and transverse momentum for different centralities of the collision. Transition from in-plane to out-of-plane flow as a function of particle rapidity is observed for protons and deuterons. The dependence of elliptic flow on rapidity is suggested to be a good probe for the stud of the transient pressure in the collision. The first and second order azimuthal anisotropies of charged pions and kaons have been measured. A weak in-plane elliptic flow of charged pions is detected for the first time at the AGS. The experimental results have been compared with the predictions of the RQMD event generator run in cascade and mean field modes.</description><creator>Filimonov, Kirill.</creator><contributor>Mark, S.

I present an account of the notion of narrative and explore the nature of justified narrative assertions. I then turn to skeptical and anti-realist arguments about the ability of narratives to represent truthfully the world. Such arguments are widespread in postmodernist and poststructuralist circles, and in order to evaluate them, I consider particular arguments of Jean-Francois Lyotard, Christopher Norris and Hayden White, all of whom question the ability of narratives to be true. The positions of these theorists rely upon deep conceptual confusion, and, after sorting out their claims, I conclude that they offer no compelling reasons to doubt that narratives can accurately and truthfully represent the world. Next, I offer an analysis of the relationship between the notion of personhood and narrative. I argue against postmodernist and poststructuralist critiques of subjectivity, and, drawing on the work of various contemporary philosophers, I defend notions of subjectivity and selfhood while acknowledging and examining the essentially narrative nature of such phenomena. The concept of a "personal history" receives detailed analysis, as does the notion of a "situated self." While agreeing with particular criticisms of what is often called the "modern self," I argue that there are specific normative projects of modernity, namely autonomy and self-realization, that are worth preserving. Finally, I explore the themes of narrative, knowledge and personhood in the nouvelles of Samuel Beckett. These works represent crises of narrative and personhood, and they depict the epistemic and ethical difficulties encountered by persons under conditions of modernity, conditions in which individual lives often lack narrative unity and meaning. I read Beckett as a critic of culture whose work, while deeply critical of certain trends in modern culture, points to the need for individual subjects to find true and meaningful narratives in which they can participate as co-authors.</description><creator>Brown, Peter Robert, 1963-</creator><contributor>Livingston, Paisley (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Bristol, Michael D.

His creative practice ranged from hermitage planning to the clothing design of its occupants, from architectural legislation to the composition of psalms to be sung in the hermitage churches. Through the medieval art of memory, Francis formed his architectural intentions around two contemplative foci: first, the symbol of the tau, which became his attire, prayer position, signature, talisman for healing the sick and the crucifixion of Christ imprinted on his flesh in the stigmata; and second, the chapel of the Portiuncula, which Francis renovated himself to be the cave of the annunciation and the nativity, the womb of Mary and a portion of heaven on earth where angels descended. With its hedge-bound monastery. it became the prototype for construction among his followers. As the art of memory aimed at an ethics, so did his architecture strive to inspire communal good through narratives of compassion, voluntary penance and humility. The Portiuncula was copied throughout the Franciscan order, but as the order grew its commitment to poverty waned. As a result, buildings began to deviate from Francis' ideals. Rather than resort to prescriptive architectural legislation, Francis addressed this dilemma through an intricately choreographed performance of his death whose poetic image would be unforgettable for those who wished to imitate him in word, deed and architecture. Two years after this event the Basilica of San Francesco in Assisi, built by his friend and hand-chosen successor, Br. Elias, rapidly rose to house the newly canonized saint. Its earliest form, narrative and symbolism, also widely imitated, seems to illustrate aptly Francis' architectural vision: if the Portiuncula was the Bethlehem of the order, the Basilica's tau plan became its Jerusalem. From these two prototypes Italian mendicant architecture for the next century drew its meaning and form.</description><creator>Caicco, Gregory Paul.</creator><contributor>Perez-Gomez, Alberto (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Francis, of Assisi, Saint, 1182-1226 -- Views on church architecture.</subject><subject>Franciscan architecture.</subject><title>Ethics and poetics : the architectural vision of Saint Francis of Assisi</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hx11xg60m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v118rg19j</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2227mr621</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:36:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Vulvar vestibulitis is a highly prevalent and underinvestigated pain syndrome that is considered the most common subtype of dyspareunia, or painful intercourse, in pre-menopausal women. The first chapter of this thesis consists of a critical review of the vulvar vestibulitis literature, covering descriptive, diagnostic, etiologic, and treatment aspects. This is followed by a retrospective study of 38 women, investigating the success of vestibulectomy, a frequently recommended medical treatment for vulvar vestibulitis. Results from structured telephone interviews pertaining to dyspareunia and sexual function show that 63.2% of participants experienced a significant improvement or a complete cure while 36.8% reported moderate to no improvement. The third and fourth chapters are based on a randomized treatment outcome study of women with vulvar vestibulitis. Data from 146 participants taking part in the recruitment phase of the treatment outcome study were used to investigate the reliability of the vulvar vestibulitis diagnosis. Findings demonstrate moderate to substantial inter-rater agreement and test-retest reliability. The fourth paper reports results from the randomized comparison of 78 women meeting study selection criteria and assigned either to group cognitive-behavioral therapy, surface electromyographic biofeedback, or vestibulectomy. They were assessed at pretreatment, posttreatment and 6-month follow-up via gynecological examinations, a structured interview and standard questionnaires pertaining to dyspareunia, sexual function, and psychosocial adjustment. Results from the treatment outcome study demonstrate that (1) participants from the three treatment conditions significantly improve from pretreatment to 6-month follow-up on all pain measures, and (2) vestibulectomy is significantly more successful than biofeedback and group cognitive-behavioral therapy in relieving vulvar vestibulitis.

In the first part, I maintain that feminist dramatic re-vision is one manifestation of an unrecognized tradition of women's writing in which criticism is expressed through fiction. I also argue that the project of feminist dramatic re-vision embodies a feminist "new poetics." In the second part, I examine the aesthetics and politics of tragedy from a feminist perspective. Feminist arguments against tragedy are, in effect arguments against patriarchy. But it is the theorists and critics of tragedy---not the playwrights---who are unequivocally aligned with patriarchy. Playwrights like Euripides and Shakespeare can be seen to destabilize tragedy in their plays. In the third part, I show how recent feminist playwrights (Jackie Crossland, Dario Fo and Franca Rame, Deborah Porter, Caryl Churchill and David Lan, Maureen Duffy, Alison Lyssa, The Women's Theatre Group and Elaine Feinstein, Joan Ure, Margaret Clarke, and Ann-Marie MacDonald) counter tragedy by extrapolating from the arguments presented by Euripides and Shakespeare in The Medea, The Bacchae, King Lear, Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet and Othello , and by allocating voice and agency to their female protagonists.</description><creator>Burnett, Linda Avril.</creator><contributor>Lieblein, Leanore (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Feminism and theater.</subject><subject>Tragedy.</subject><subject>Feminist literary criticism.</subject><subject>Euripides.</subject><subject>Shakespeare, William, 1564-1616.</subject><title>The argument against tragedy in feminist dramatic re-vision of the plays of Euripides and Shakespeare /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g445cg01x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hk895</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hd76s182j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:37:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A new approach has been studied for solution-phase oligosaccharide syntheses using low molecular weight poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ethers (MPEG, average Mn = 550 and 750) as oligomer supports. A complex branched mannononaose (Man9) has been synthesized by this method in a very concise way to yield a large quantity of final product. Attempt has been made towards the synthesis of a heptasaccharide phytoalexin elicitor (HPE). Model linear mannotetraose and branched mannopentaose were first tested using the novel HMB low molecular weight poly(ethylene glycol) linker. The use of this linker as the oligomer support retains the normal advantages of polymer-supported solution synthesis of oligosaccharides. Purification of the supported synthons by flash column chromatography on silica gel is greatly simplified. Another advantage of this approach is that the reaction can be monitored readily by the usual arsenal of spectroscopic techniques. Both compounds were obtained in over 10% overall yields. In order to synthesize properly protected glycosyl donors for the construction of the mannononaose, the regioselective reductive ring opening of benzylidene acetals in carbohydrates with BH3/Bu2BOTf and regioselective acylation of hexopyranosides with pivaloyl chloride have been developed. BH 3/Bu2OTf is an effective reagent to reductively cleave 4,6- O-benzylidene acetals of various hexopyranosides to the corresponding 4-O-benzyl ethers. 4,6-O-isopropylidene acetals can be similarly cleaved. Common protecting groups are stable to the reaction conditions. On the other hand, the regioselectivity in the acylation of hexopyranosides with pivaloyl chloride in pyridine was studied. Manno- and galacto-pyranosides were regioselectively acylated to give the 3- O-pivaloylated compounds in good yields. Both methodologies have been used to provide properly protected mannoside donors and acceptors for polymannan syntheses. The regioselective reductive ring opening of 4,6- O-benzylidene acetals of hexopyranosides has also been demonstrated by concise syntheses of two building blocks of a heptasaccharide phytoalexin elicitor (HPE). A concise synthesis of the mannan residue of a highly branched mannose type oligosaccharide present on the viral coat of HIV-1 from only two monosaccharide building blocks was achieved. The synthesis requires only five coupling steps instead of the seven or more steps required for the conventional block synthesis. In addition, even though the synthesis of HPE has not been completed to the last step, it showed that adjustment of the length of the poly(ethylene glycol) oligomer support could result in better overall yields. In both cases, 1H-1H COSY and 1H-13C HMQC NMR spectroscopies have proven to be extremely useful in monitoring the progress of oligosaccharide construction. These syntheses demonstrate that oligomer-supported solution synthesis using low molecular weight poly(ethylene glycol) is a powerful tool for the rapid and efficient preparation of complex oligosaccharides.</description><creator>Jiang, Lu, 1967-</creator><contributor>Chan, Tak-Hang (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Chemistry, Organic.</subject><title>Oligomer-supported solution synthesis of oligosaccharides using low molecular weight poly(ethylene glycol) linkers</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cz30pv33s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hd76s182j</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zw12z709w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:37:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The introduction of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms has affected many elements of the constitutional system in Canada. This dissertation explores the Charter's relationship with liberal constitutionalism and Canadian federalism, and considers whether judicial review on Charter grounds has seen a progression, or a regression, from parliamentary to constitutional to judicial supremacy. Further, this dissertation considers whether Charter review has reduced provincial autonomy by imposing national values in provincial areas of jurisdiction when Charter review nullifies provincial statutes. Through a complex process referred to as the rebalancing of liberal constitutionalism, this study argues that a changed Charter jurisprudence by the Supreme Court of Canada and a changed policy process within the administrative state at the federal level have reduced the negative implications of Charter review for liberal constitutionalism and Canadian federalism. To advance this argument, the concept of Charter activism is introduced to demonstrate that the rebalancing of liberal constitutionalism is the product of the shifting equilibrium within two distinct elements that comprise Charter activism---judicial activism and bureaucratic activism. This study pursues three themes to demonstrate that the decline of judicial activism and the emergence of bureaucratic activism now converge at a point within Charter politics that facilitate the rebalancing of liberal constitutionalism and ensure that Charter review advances constitutional and not judicial supremacy. The first theme investigates the Supreme Court of Canada as a policy actor during Charter review, and analyzes Charter decisions between 1982 and 1997. The second theme considers the impact of Charter review on Canadian federalism and whether the Charter has centralized Canadian federalism and reduced provincial autonomy. The final theme investigates bureaucratic activism and the changes within the policy process at the fe</description><creator>Kelly, James B.</creator><contributor>Meadwell, Hudson (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Schultz, Richard (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Manfredi, Christopher (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Judicial power -- Canada.</subject><subject>Canada.

The decline of the British Empire in the twentieth century has had far-reaching consequences for the former heart of empire. In the second half of the twentieth century, immigrants from the Caribbean, Africa, and Asia have transformed Britain into an ethnically and racially diverse nation. The colonies have 'come home to roost.' Following Conrad's narrative in Heart of Darkness, my thesis begins in London and then moves to the margins of the empire. The long shadow of imperialism shapes the novels of J. M. Coetzee and Bessie Head. In their works these two writers depict the evils of apartheid South Africa and reflect upon the complex psychological mechanisms that underlie encounters between different groups. Such encounters result in a pattern of nonrecognition and misrecognition that in turn create relations based upon domination and servitude. Coetzee's and Head's works speculate on the psychological structures that have shaped the history of colonialism in Africa. Returning to London, my thesis then examines the works of two writers who combine experience of the colony with knowledge of the centre of Empire. Doris Lessing's experience of coming-of-age in Southern Rhodesia supplies her with powerful insights into both the plight of new immigrants to Britain and the concerns and prejudices of native Londoners. Her knowledge of identity politics in Southern Africa deepens her fictional response to post-war British society. The detective writer Mike Phillips came to Britain from Guyana as a child and he now resides in London. While his novels reflect the concerns of a first-generation black immigrant to the United Kingdom they also depict the challenges and rewards of being black in the London of today.</description><creator>Kenny, Tobias.</creator><contributor>Hensley, David C.

The first essay uses a technical indicator, the stochastic oscillator, for market timing in the bond market. The trading strategy using this technical indicator is optimized using a genetic algorithm The second essay finds that a measure of market chaos improves the performance of a simple trend-following technique in the stock market. The last essay uses technical analysis for asset allocation.
