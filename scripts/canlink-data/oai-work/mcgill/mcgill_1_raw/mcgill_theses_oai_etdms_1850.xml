The original algorithm was presented by Shamos in 1978 in order to find the diameter of a convex polygon; a few years later, Toussaint showed that the essence of the algorithm can be used to solve a number of other problems. In the past twenty years, research done by Toussaint and others has shown the Rotating Calipers to be a paradigm in Computational Geometry, applicable to a variety of problems. The resulting algorithms are often optimal in their time complexity, and always efficient and easy to implement. This work is an extensive collection of these results, including all those obtained at McGill University. It is the first time such a collection has been done, and would therefore be viewed as an important asset by many researchers around the world. The results in question are reviewed, and proofs lacking in their original articles are provided. Furthermore, a new result is obtained. The problems studied in this work include the diameter and width of convex polygons, the maximum and minimum distance between convex polygons, the minimum area and minimum perimeter enclosing rectangles for convex polygons, onion and spiral triangulations, quadrangulations, merging convex hulls, intersecting convex polygons, common tangents and critical support lines, and vector sums of convex polygons. To supplement the theoretical aspect of this work, a synthesis of this work is provided on the Internet, as well as an interactive applet demonstrating the use of the Rotating Calipers in solving many of the above mentioned problems.</description><creator>Pirzadeh, Hormoz.</creator><contributor>Toussaint, Godfried T.

The first objective of this study was to investigate the expressivity of MART-1/Melan-A in primary uveal melanomas. 56 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human uveal melanomas were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. MART-1/Melan-A was found to be positive in 73% of cases, with almost 50% of tumours showing a diffuse involvement. The second objective was to investigate the expression of MAA Mart-1/Melan-A and gp100 in primary and metastatic human uveal melanoma lesions developed in albino rabbits. MART-1/Melan-A and gp100 were expressed in all primary lesions, with mainly focal distribution. Conversely, MART-1/Melan-A and gp100 exhibited a homogeneous pattern in the metastatic lesions, which implies upregulation of these antigens during disease progression. It may be postulated that MART-1/Melan-A and gp100 would be effective immunomarkers for immunotherapeutic strategies in human uveal melanoma.</description><creator>Peschlow, Alexandra.</creator><contributor>Burnier, M.

Molecular mechanism(s) of this type of resistance are not fully understood. Using a panel of N-SCLC cell lines, we have demonstrated that upregulation of DNA repair is due, at least in part, to an overexpression of the tyrosine kinase receptor erbB-2. To explore the mechanism by which erbB-2 affects DNA repair regulation in N-SCLC, I examined the transcriptional regulation of three proteins involved in the early steps of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, namely XPA, XPB, and XPD, using vectors where a CAT gene was under the control of the promoter for each of the genes. The second part of my studies was to investigate the effect of potential novel inhibitors of DNA repair synthesis, termed ketonucleosides and keto-C-nucleosides, on cell killing of erbB-2 overexpressing cells compared to cells with low erbB-2. The cytotoxicity and apoptotic induction ability of these drugs was measured in a panel of N-SCLC cell lines.

Narratives were qualitatively analyzed. Deaf persons see their world as separate from the hearing world of health services. The latter is perceived as lacking understanding of deaf persons, leading to their feeling of exclusion and powerlessness. What is supposed to be a source of support becomes one of anxiety. Nevertheless, deaf people show courage and versatility in coping strategies including affiliation and the notion of culture. The health system focus on 'normalization' contradicts deaf persons' perceptions of deafness as a meaningful human reality. The differing values have implications for health professionals and the organization of services. The McGill Model of Nursing offers an organizational framework for planning accessible health services for deaf persons.</description><creator>Paris√©, Nicole.</creator><contributor>Corin, Ellen (advisor)</contributor><contributor>Pepler, Carolyn (advisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Health Sciences, Nursing.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Health Care Management.</subject><title>Breaking cultural barriers to health care : the voice of the deaf</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fj236419r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rw61b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Nursing</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vd66w188z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:13:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Bicaudal-D (Bic-D) is essential in Drosophila for the establishment of oocyte fate and polarity within the developing oocyte. To study these processes we have engineered a chimeric Bic-D::GFP fusion protein which behaves like the endogenous Bic-D polypeptide. We have identified three genes which are required for the normal subcellular distribution of Bic-D::GFP two genes predicted to encode RNA binding proteins (egalitarian and orb) and Dynein heavy chain. In particular, they affect Bic-D::GFP localization during the early germarial stages of oogenesis during which oocyte fate is established, or later when anterior-posterior polarity is initiated. Our results support the model that Bic-D acts in conjunction with mRNA binding proteins and a negative-end directed microtubule motor in localizing mRNAs. Throughout stages 1--6 of oocyte development, Bic-D::GFP accumulates in the oocyte in a strong posterior cortical focus, resembling a spool, that is aligned with a crater-like indentation in the oocyte nucleus. The aligned focus and crater reveal an early oocyte polarity and a previously undescribed asymmetric subcellular structure that may be involved in tethering the oocyte nucleus. Shape, positioning and orientation of the oocyte nucleus change around stage 6--7, concomitantly with a change in position of the Bic-D::GFP focus to the presumptive dorsoanterior corner. This re-orientation appears to anticipate the establishment of a new dorsoventral polarity in the oocyte and egg chamber. Dhc and Bic-D are both involved in the process of re-orientation of the oocyte nucleus and in polarity formation.</description><creator>Par√©, Chantal.</creator><contributor>Suter, Beat (advisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Drosophila -- Molecular genetics.</subject><subject>Oogenesis.</subject><title>Genetic analysis of localization of a Bic-D::GFP fusion protein and identification of novel subcellular domains</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/73666679b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vd66w188z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3n2041332</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:13:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Intracellular calcium has been widely demonstrated as an important part of intracellular signalling pathways. Entry of calcium in cells has been shown to trigger a variety of processes such as contraction in smooth and skeletal muscle, release of neurotransmitter in neurons and activation of modifying proteins in most cells, which in turn will activate or deactivate other processes. For these reasons, calcium permeation through any ion-channel type, whether ligand or voltage-gated, expressed on the surface of a cell, might potentially influence the intracellular activities or status of that cell. Calcium permeation in muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptors has long been shown unequivocally. Calcium permeation through neuronal nAChR's has also been shown, but these experiments were done on preparations of neurons. Typically, neurons might express two or three subunits of the same type. The lack of knowledge on the assembly of subunits into receptors and the possibility that subunits might be permutable in a receptor make the exact subunit composition of the receptors unknown. To test the hypothesis that calcium is a permeant ion of the alpha 4beta2 subtype neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), I performed single-channel patch-clamp experiments on micro-injected Xenopus oocytes expressing alpha4beta2 neuronal nAChR. When recording from single cell receptors in increasing concentration of extracellular Ca2+ I found that the amplitude of the single-channel current decreased with each increment in concentration. The behaviour of the resulting current-voltage relationships is described as a direct influence of calcium permeation on single-channel current amplitude. Analysis with a theoretical model describing permeation at the single-channel level supported this conclusion.</description><creator>Paquet, Michel.</creator><contributor>Cooper, E. J.

A spinal role for NO in carrageenan-induced thermal hyperalgesia was confirmed by dose-dependently reducing the hyperalgesia with a non-selective NOS inhibitor. Next, it was determined that a relatively selective neuronal NOS (nNOS) inhibitor and two relatively selective inducible NOS (iNOS) inhibitors were able to reduce carrageenan-induced thermal hyperalgesia. Finally, early administration of either an nNOS or an iNOS inhibitor had no significant effect on carrageenan-induced thermal hyperalgesia. However, late administration of an iNOS, but not an nNOS inhibitor, significantly reduced the thermal hyperalgesia. We therefore suggest that iNOS contributes to only the late stages of carrageenan-induced thermal hyperalgesia, while nNOS likely plays a role throughout the entire time course of the injury.</description><creator>Osborne, Michael G.</creator><contributor>Coderre, Terence (advisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Nitric oxide -- Physiological effect.</subject><subject>Pain -- Physiological aspects.</subject><title>The role of nitric oxide in carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/02870z10z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4q77ft54s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mg74qp19b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:13:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The use of a biofungicide on the perfect stage of V. inaequalis on leaf litter is one potential way to reduce the number of fungicides used to control apple scab. The previous in vitro screenings of Quebec mycoflora have shown that several isolates are able to significantly reduce the primary inoculum of the pathogen. Among the screened fungi, P176A and P130A, reduced over 98% of the ascospore production and were as effective as Athelia bombacina. However, because in vitro tests are generally poor predictors of in vivo assays a re-evaluation of the antagonists was done under field conditions. Eight fungal isolates, leaf shredding, and two comparative treatments (A. bombacina, 5% urea) were applied to intact scabbed leaves in October 1994 and 1995. After the treatments, the leaves overwintered on the orchard ground until the next spring. In April, samples of treated leaves were randomly selected and placed in spore traps to collect the ejected ascospores during rainfall. Since the primary inoculum was ejected during a four-month period, antagonism was based upon ratings taken throughout the whole ejection season. To evaluate the effect of incubation conditions on the antagonistic performance we incubated separately, in vitro and in vivo, sterile leaf disks which were artificially inoculated with V. inaequalis and fungal isolates.

Samples of four soil series and 3 sediment samples from the St. Esprit watershed, Quebec, Canada were treated with KH2PO 4 solutions of 0, 50,100, and 500 mg kg--1 of soil. The relationship between water-extractable phosphorus (soluble phosphorus) and Mehlich III available phosphorus was determined at water: soil ratios 100:1, 200:1, 500:1. Measurements were made on a LACHAT QuickChem AE instrument (based on EPA method 365.3; USEPA, 1983) after 4 hours of shaking. More than 90% of the soluble phosphorus was released after 3 hours of shaking for all the soil samples and the sediment sample. Therefore, the shaking time for release of soluble P was set at 4 hours for all soil groups of the watershed. Mehlich III extractable phosphorus was also determined for each soil and sediment sample. Using a modified form of a well-known equation, it was possible to show that, with appropriate values for the constants, linear relationships exist between the logarithm of soluble phosphorus and the logarithm of Mehlich III extractable phosphorus at different water soil ratios. This was true for all soil groups and the sediment sample. Thus, given the soil type of a particular watershed, and using the linear relationship (isotherm) for that type, it becomes possible to predict the phosphorus yields from agricultural lands with reasonable confidence.</description><creator>Nur, Ali A.</creator><contributor>Madramootoo, C.

These XY females are infertile mainly due to the death of their embryos. This developmental failure has been attributed to a defect intrinsic to the XY oocyte. The present study examined the transcriptional activity of the X and Y chromosomes in these oocytes. RT-PCR results show that the Ube1y gene is transcribed in the XY ovary at all stages examined and also in growing XY oocytes. The Sry gene was transcribed only at the onset of ovarian differentiation whereas the Zfy gene was undetectable at all stages during fetal life. The Xist gene, which is involved in X inactivation, was not expressed in XY oocytes. We speculate that expression of Y-encoded genes may have a deleterious effect on the quality of the oocytes and thus renders them incompetent for post-fertilization development.</description><creator>Nasseri, Roksana.</creator><contributor>Taketo, Teruko (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Sex determination, Genetic</subject><subject>Mice -- Molecular genetics</subject><subject>Sex chromosomes</subject><subject>Sex differentiation disorders</subject><title>Transcriptional activity of sex chromosomes in the oocytes of the B6.Ytir sex-reversed female mouse</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2f75r987w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v405sc398</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x059c954r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:13:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is part of a broader project that examines three different approaches to evaluating trace metal contamination in urban brownfields: the measure of total soil metals; calculating bioavailable metals; and the use of species as bioindicators of trace metals in soils. Chapter 1 discusses the problems inherent in each approach such as; inconsistent results due to differences in techniques, extrapolation from laboratory to field, and the influence of species differences and environmental conditions. Chapter 2 is a site description measuring biodiversity, community structure and activity of three urban brownfields. The site description was used to select organisms that were subsequently evaluated for their usefulness as bioindicators of trace metals (chapter 3).

Limitations of removing the linear trend from the fields, and thereby removing the large-scale variance, are discussed. The spectra of difference fields are calculated, yielding the error variance for different scales. Spectral methods are used widely in the evaluation of global models. In this study, the same method is used for evaluating the CRCM in its ability to correctly reproduce the mesoscale systems in short-term integrations, when low-resolution GCM-like initial and lateral boundary conditions are provided. Two cases have been chosen for this study, the first one over the Montreal region and second one over the Mackenzie River Basin (MRB). It is found that the relative error variance growth at most scales, particularly the small scales, is less for the MRB region possibly due to the topographic forcing. In both cases and all experiments, the maximum relative error variance is found to be at a wavelength of about 350-km. Root mean square (rms) error and relative rms error for the geopotential height field for both cases are very small and show little or no growth, when scale decompositions are not made. However, the relative error variance when examined according to scale, show considerable differences. The relative errors at different scales show different growth rates and that of the meso-alpha and synoptic scales are found to be growing with time.</description><creator>Mundakkara, Ravi Varma.</creator><contributor>Laprise, Rene (advisor)</contributor><contributor>Zawadzki, Isztar (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</subject><title>Validation of the Canadian Regional Climate Model using spectral analysis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1n79h659t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vm40xt888</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gm80hx541</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:13:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A validation study was conducted in the Maasai and Batemi communities of Arusha, Tanzania between December 1996 and January 1997. The aim of this study was to compare a participatory nutrition status assessment procedure carried out by community members with an assessment completed by a professional. The study validated women (15--50 years of age) dietary intake assessments and assessed the reliability of anthropometric assessments of preschool (12--71 months) children in the hands of non-professionals. The prevalence of under-nutrition was similar for the two data sets and reliability of anthropometric measurements was found to be good except for the mid-upper-arm circumference measurement for which the difference between measurements of the professional and the nonprofessional and between two occasions differed significantly (p &lt; 0.001). Results suggest that participatory nutrition status assessment procedure by community members is useful and fairly reliable, giving results similar to a procedure administered by a professional for some anthropometric indices. The correlation between a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire administered by community members and a series of three 24-h recalls administered by a professional for assessing the risk of inadequate intake was found to be weak for vitamin A and protein but moderate for iron. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients between the mean of three 24-h recalls values and semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire estimates were 0.47 (p &lt; 0.05) for iron, 0.29 (p &lt; 0.05) for protein and 0.26 (p &lt; 0.05) for vitamin A. The questionnaire produced results showing significantly higher intake estimates of protein (p &lt; 0.001), vitamin A (p &lt; 0.001) and iron (p &lt; 0.01) than the average of three 24-hour recalls.</description><creator>Mselle, Laurent Sadikieli.</creator><date>1998</date><subject>Masai (African people) -- Nutrition.</subject><title>Validation of participatory nutrition status assessment methods in Maasai and Batemi communities of Ngorongoro, Arusha Tanzania</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6m311r50t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gm80hx541</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rf55z989z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:13:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Soil phosphate is essential for the development and maturity of crops. Plants absorb phosphate from the soil solution which is continuously replenished by fertilizer application and/or desorption from the soil solid phase. Anion exchange membranes (AEMs), act in a similar way to plant roots, adsorbing P from soil solution. Desorption of available P was studied in 1997 on two Gleysolic soils rich in P, a Ste. Rosalie clay soil and a Duravin sandy loam soil, using fluoride-saturated AEMs let in soil suspension for various contact periods. Determination of available P using these AEMs was compared to P extraction using the Mehlich III extractant for predicting P availability to soybean (Glycine max L.). Desorption from both soils, and subsequent adsorption by AEMs was found to decrease with time. A high P desorption rate was calculated for both soils with the Elovich equation. Different chemical and physical characteristics such as pH, Mehlich III extractable Al, Fe and Ca, sand and clay content were in some cases, positively correlated and in other cases, negatively correlated with various contact periods for both soils. The use of AEMs better predicted P availability than the Mehlich III extractant, although the most important asset of using AEMs is that they showed the desorption effect over time on P availability. It was observed that P remobilization from the vegetative part to the grain was reduced due to the high P concentration in both soils.</description><creator>Medina-Ross, Jose Antonio.</creator><contributor>Hamel, Chantal (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Soils -- Phosphorus content -- Qu√©bec (Province)</subject><subject>Soybean -- Fertilizers -- Qu√©bec (Province).</subject><subject>Ion-permeable membranes.</subject><subject>Tillage -- Qu√©bec (Province).</subject><subject>Soybean -- Soils -- Qu√©bec (Province).</subject><title>Study on phosphorus desorption and availability to soybean (Glycine max L.) in two phosphorus rich Gleysolic soils under different tillage and fertilization practices</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tm70mx595.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rf55z989z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jd472z503</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:13:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The objective of this study was to estimate the relationship between survival at various stages of productive life (17, 30, 43, 55 and 96 months of productive life) and type traits in Quebec Holstein and Ayrshire cows. The original data set from the Programme d'Analyse des Troupeaux Laitiers du Quebec contained 559,203 lifetime records calculated from 2,237,081 lactation records including calvings from 1979 to 1995. Lifetime records containing type classification information provided by the respective breed associations were used to study true survival variables (opportunity to survive to 17, 302 43, 55 and 96 months) and functional survival variables opportunity to survive to the same ages, independently of the level of production). K. Meyer's EQREML program was used to analyse these data by fitting a sire model. Heritabilities varied between 0.03 and 0.11 for both breeds. Final score and rear udder were two of the traits most highly correlated with survival. Specifically, in Holsteins, mammary system and fore udder showed the highest genetic correlation with functional survival, and dairy character showed the highest genetic correlation with true survival. In Ayrshires, final score, breed character, dairy quality, style and fore udder had the highest genetic correlations with both true and functional survival across all survival stages. In a second study, lifetime records not having type information and type records without lifetime information were analysed with D. L. Johnson and R. Thompson's AIREML program which enabled linking of sires in common between type and lifetime data sets. Only survival to 96 months was studied here, but the effect of supervised and non-supervised records was considered. In Holstein supervised records, body traits were more highly correlated with survival, whereas udder traits were more highly correlated in the non-supervised records. Ayrshire results were not conclusive.</description><creator>Philpot, Jill C.</creator><contributor>Monardes, Humberto (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Ayrshire cattle -- Qu√©bec (Province) -- Genetics.</subject><subject>Holstein-Friesian cattle -- Qu√©bec (Province) -- Genetics.</subject><title>Relationships between survival and linear type traits in Quebec Holsteins and Ayrshires</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r207tr45w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jd472z503</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Animal Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n583xx01r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:13:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A lacZ transcriptional fusion library was constructed without the cloned gene of interest (i.e. nlp). To do this, the nlp gene was interrupted using luxAB and a tetracycline resistance gene in the Deltalac strain E. coli 40. This strain (LF20300) was subsequently transformed with an expression vector possessing the ara PBAD promoter and a chloramphenicol resistance marker (pBAD18Cm). The plasmid-containing strain was then lysogenized with a Mu d1 phage containing the lacZYA reporter gene and an ampicillin resistance marker. The resulting lysogens were selected on TCMG plates containing 0.2% glucose, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin. These lysogens were then mastered onto TCMG plates containing either 0.2% glucose or 0.2% arabinose plus X-gal and the appropriate antibiotics. Differences in blue colour were noted for eight different clones on glucose in comparison to their growth on arabinose. Total genomic DNA was isolated from each arabinose-responsive clone, digested with several different restriction endonucleases, and subjected to Southern hybridization (using labeled lacZ as a probe). Putative restriction maps were determined for those clones with single Mu d1 inserts, and used to identify candidate genes from the complete restriction map of E. coli.

This was done previously by using enzyme inhibition assays (Chen et al, 1996), in which binding is detectable only for those peptides that bind to the catalytic site, and hence compete with the substrate for that site. For this reason, Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) was utilised since heat detection provides a more direct measurement of binding, irrespective of its location on the enzyme. However, several difficulties were encountered which rendered this approach less feasible. Nevertheless, in the course of analysing complications of the cathepsin B system, other biophysical techniques were used in addition to ITC. In turn, this helped further characterise several aspects of cathepsin B interactions. In summary, ITC was used to study cathepsin B interactions with its propeptide, several nitrile inhibitors, leupeptin, and E64.

They can trigger chain reactions like peroxidation of membrane phospholipids, leading to osmotic imbalance and cell death. Isoprostanes are stable products of lipid peroxidation that have a constrictor effect on the vasculature and bronchii. As isoprostanes are abundantly generated in tissues under oxidant stress, we have hypothesized that they could be related to endothelial dysfunction observed during ischemia/reperfasion by affecting endothelial cell survival. The effects of 8-iso-PGE2 and 8-iso-PGF2alpha, two abundantly produced isoprostanes, were studied on porcine endothelial cultures and isolated brain microvessels. Cell survival was evaluated by MTT reduction, double staining with DNA-binding fluorochromes and in situ DNA fragmentation labeling, 8-Iso-PGF2alpha (1--10 nM) induced 20--25% cell death in endothelial cultures after 24 h coincident with similar increase in the number of cells that become permeable to PI. On the contrary, 8-iso-PGE 2 did not affect endothelial cell survival. Approximately 9% of the cells suffered apoptosis. This percentage remained unchanged regardless the treatment. Several observations indicate a role for thromboxane A2 to mediate 8-iso-PGF2alpha-induced death: (1) the levels of thromboxane A2 increased dramatically in endothelial cultures after 8-iso-PGF2alpha-treatment; (2) inhibitors of thromboxane synthase, CGS12970 and U6355A and Ibuprofen, a non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenases, reverted the effect of the isoprostane; (3) analogs of thromboxane A2 U46619 and IBOP, reproduce the effect of 8-iso-PGF 2alpha after 24 h. 8-Iso-PGF2alpha also decreased endothelial viability on isolated brain microvessels. These results suggest, that 8-iso-PGF2alpha, might be a direct contributor to ischemia/reperfusion injury.</description><creator>Martinez Bermudez, Ana Katherine.</creator><contributor>Almazan, Guillermina (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Chemtob, Sylvain (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</subject><title>Isoprostanes in brain endothelial cell death</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fb494b43b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q524jq971</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4j03d2136</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:13:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Canadian Penning trap Mass Spectrometer (CPTMS) was reassembled and commissioned at Argonne National Laboratory. It consists of three systems: a laser desorption ion source, used for stable isotope production; a radio-frequency quadrupole ion trap (Paul trap); and a Penning trap, which sits inside a homogeneous 6 Tesla magnetic field. The CPTMS was tested using gold ions: these were accelerated toward the Paul trap, where they were accumulated and cooled down. They were then sent to the Penning trap, in which ions undergo circular motion. These motions were resonantly excited using an RF dipole electric field, and the resonant frequency was measured as a minimum in time-of-flight of the ejected ions as they were led to a region of low magnetic field, converting their cyclotron energy to axial kinetic energy. The apparatus was found to be operational: multiple-bunch accumulation was observed for the first time in a Paul trap, and the Fourier limited frequency resolution of 2 x 10--6 was attained for a one second excitation time in the Penning trap.</description><creator>Martinez, Pedro.</creator><contributor>Lee, Jonathan K.

This study is the first to detect CKI-gamma2, as mRNA and protein, widely expressed in mouse tissues and mammalian cells. In addition, CKI-gamma2 as a protein of 75kDa was immunologically detected coprecipitating with Nck, an adaptor protein involved in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling. CKI-gamma2 coprecipitated with Nck presents similar enzymatic properties as the recombinant and endogenous CKI-gamma2, demonstrating that the immunoreactive p75 CKI-gamma2 associated with Nck is indeed CKI-gamma2. These results suggest that Nck-mediated signaling downstream of activated RTKs could involve CKI-gamma2 as an important component. The finding that Nck is a substrate of CKI-gamma2, suggests that the function of Nck may be regulated by CKI-gamma2. Furthermore, observations that insulin negatively regulates p75 CKI-gamma2 activity provide evidence for a role of the Nck-CKI-gamma2 complex in insulin signaling. Understanding the insulin regulation of CKI-gamma2 may point to the biological function of this enzyme.</description><creator>Cardillo Marricco, Nadia.</creator><contributor>Larose, Louise (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><title>Characterization of casein kinase I-c2, as a serinethreonine protein kinase associated with the adaptor protein, Nck</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1544br599.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bd78s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:f1881p186</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:14:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The present studies examined differences in proenkephalin and prodynorphin peptide mRNA content, using in situ hybridization, and in opioid receptor density, using receptor autoradiography, between rats bred selectively for their high (AA) and low (ANA) alcohol consumption. Results indicated that AA rats had a significantly greater content of proenkephalin mRNA in the, arcuate nucleus (p ‚â§ .01) and caudate putamen ( p ‚â§ .005) as well as a greater overall content of proenkephalin mRNA, compared to ANA rats (p ‚â§ .01). The content of prodynorphin mRNA was significantly higher in the arcuate nucleus (p ‚â§ .01) of the AA than ANA rats. Receptor autoradiography results indicated that AA rats had a significantly greater density of mu opioid receptors in the shell region of the nucleus accumbens and the prefrontal cortex ( p ‚â§ .01), and a greater overall binding for the mu ( p ‚â§ .05), but not for the delta or kappa opioid receptors, compared to ANA rats. The presence of inherited differences in the activity of distinct components of the endogenous opioid system in brain regions associated with the processes of reward and reinforcement are in line with previous findings and suggest that endogenous opioids may play a role in determining the difference in preference for ethanol between the AA and ANA rats.</description><creator>Marinelli, Peter W.</creator><contributor>Gianoulakis, Christina (advisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Psychology, Psychobiology.</subject><subject>Psychology, Physiological.</subject><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Differences in the content of proenkepephalin and prodynorphin mRNAan opioid receptor density in the brains of alcohol preferring AA and alcohol avoiding ANA</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gx41mm053.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f1881p186</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychiatry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0c483m25c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:14:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Since the emergence of the object technology, organizations have accumulated a tremendous amount of object-oriented (OO) code. Instead of continuing to recreate components similar to existing artifacts, and considering the rising costs of development, many organizations would like to decrease software development costs and cycle time by reusing existing OO components. The difficulty of finding reusable components is that reuse is a complex and thus less quantifiable measure. In this research, we first proposed three reuse hypotheses about the impact of three internal characteristics (inheritance, coupling, and complexity) of OO software artifacts on reusability. Corresponding metrics suites were then selected and extracted. We used C4.5, a machine learning algorithm, to build predictive models from the learning data set that we have obtained from a medium sized software system developed in C++. Each predictive models was then verified according to its completeness, correctness and global accuracy. The verification results proved that the proposed hypotheses were correct. The uniqueness of this research work is that we have combined the state of the art of three different subjects (reuse detection and prediction, OO metrics and their extraction, and applied machine learning algorithm) to form a process of finding interesting properties of OO software components that affect reusability.</description><creator>Mao, Yida, 1972-</creator><contributor>Ratzer, G.

NaCl, MgCl 2 and KCl were the salts used in the experiments, at three densities. Mixtures of the salts were also used. One set of experiments was conducted under free convection while the other was conducted under forced convection, both over pans. Temperature was relatively constant for the experiments but relative humidity was not controlled. Wind profiles were measured during the forced convection experiments and an aerodynamic equation used to calculate evaporation for comparison with the observed evaporation rates. Surface temperatures were also measured. Water activities of all the brine and brine mixtures were also measured and compared to predictions by Raoult's law. In general, it was found the evaporation rate of brines was lower than that of pure water and that the water activities and evaporation rates were density-dependent to a certain extent. More precisely, they were dependent on the actual constituents in the brine due to the different molecular weights, and the number of ions dissolving from a given weight of salt or salt mixture. Evaporation rates can better be estimated on this basis than on the basis of density alone, as one would expect from Raoult's Law.</description><creator>Mao, Yasin Sufi, 1963-</creator><contributor>Bonnell, Robert (advisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Evaporation (Meteorology)</subject><subject>Saline waters.</subject><subject>Evaporation.</subject><title>Effect of chemical composition on saline water evaporation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/41687k34g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1544br602</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fq977x113</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:14:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Cyclophosphamide is a bi-functional alkylating agent, which is used primarily in cancer chemotherapy. Cyclophosphamide acts by binding to nucleophilic ekes and causes DNA adducts, stand breaks and cross-links. The working hypothesis in our laboratory is that cyclophosphamide treatment causes specific DNA damage in male germ cells, and that cells at different stages of spermatogenesis are affected to varying degrees. In order to examine this hypothesis, the following objectives were put forth: (1) To develop the competitive PCR technique (QPCR) for the measurement of DNA damage in rat spermatozoa, (2) To examine the DNA damage incurred by CPA treatment(s) in rat spermatozoa. This work introduces the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) assay for the measurement of DNA damage in a highly developed cell type, the spermatozoa. Cyclophosphamide treatment effectively inhibits Taq polymerase in the amplification of the spermatozoal DNA target. Two treatment regimens were used: an acute high dose of cyclophosphamide that is pharmacologically relevant to the treatment of certain malignancies and a chronic low dose regimen that results in male mediated teratogenicity.
