Theories have been developed, and the concept of arousal has become quite popular in a number of fields of psychology. There are, however, not many behavioural experiments directly dealing with this system, in spite of its theoretical importance. In this thesis, an attempt will be made to reveal the role of the mesencephalic reticular formation, which constitutes a part of the activating system, in some aspects of behaviour. A series of experiments, in which the method of intracranial injection was used, will be reported after a review of the present knowledge about the reticular system and an account of methodological development.</description><creator>Nakajima, Shinshu.</creator><contributor>Milner, P.

Because of their bi-directional nature special care must be taken to match these amplifiers to the line in order to assure stability and to limit the echo signal. The two basic types of repeaters presently in use are the hybrid and the negative impedance repeaters. In this study a new arrangement, called the bridge compensated repeater, is suggested and analyzed. After developing an analytical method by which the performance of repeaters of various types can be compared, the three systems are analyzed and it is proved that the bridge compensated system possesses some desirable properties as compared to existing systems. The basic problem in designing a bridge compensated system is the design of a two-port network which must satisfy a specification related to its real and imaginary parts simultaneously. A computer method for designing such networks is developed and some results are presented. A circuit for the bridge compensated repeater is described and measuring techniques are developed to compare the accuracy of calculated and measured values. This technique is demonstrated on a simple system in which case the agreement between measured and calculated values is found to be very good.</description><creator>Nador, Peter.</creator><contributor>Farnell, G.

The production of one particle is always accompanied by the simultaneous production of another particle of the class (usually a K meson unless the energy of the initial particle is sufficiently high to produce anti-particles}. This property will be elaborated upon shortly. A question which comes to mind immediately is: what makes strange particles "strange"? These particles were first observed in cosmic radiation and Fig. 1. 1 illustrates the appearance of an event which indicated the existence of the new (strange) particles.</description><creator>Murphy, Joseph.</creator><contributor>Sharp, R.

From the nature of the process, which involved a coulombic repulsion between two fragments of high nuclear charge, it could be simultaneously deduced that fission would be accompanied by the liberation of a large amount of energy. This fact could also be predicted from the large difference between the mass of the fissioning nuclide and the sum of the masses of the product nuclides. Frisch first demonstrated this by measuring the ionization pulses produced by the fission fragments, and almost simultaneously Joliot proved it from the measurement of the fragment ranges.</description><creator>Mukherji, Shankar.

Growth economists have not been able to construct, much less to agree on, a single chain of causes and effects that would neatly explain the transition from underdevelopment to development. While this "failure" is of course only to the credit of economists, it cannot be denied that their analysis of the growth process of advanced industrial countries has yielded to them an apparatus of seemingly ready applicability to the most primitive economies. This is the kind of “external economies" which accrue frequently in the course of scientific progress: one branch profits from the discoveries and insights of another.</description><creator>Mubarak, Nasreldin.</creator><contributor>Wright, H.

In Canada, geographic and economic factors appear to have encouraged regionalism, explaining perhaps the linkage of Canadian history to a variety of staple industries and their affects upon some of the country's major political, social and economic institutions. With a regional economy being only a modest part of an international economy, transportation and communication facilities tend to become important pre-requisites to prosperity. While the particular region's staple production is expanding and is successfully integrating the region with the larger economy of which it is a part, economic growth will proceed.</description><creator>Moldofsky, Naomi.</creator><contributor>Asimakopulos, A.

As a consequence, the state of knowledge regarding the proteins and lipoproteins of the egg tends to be an expression of the prevailing state of knowledge of proteins in general. A special feature of the yolk proteins that has attracted attention from the outset of serious chemical study of the yolk is the presence of an unusually high proportion of protein containing relatively high amounts of protein-bound phosphorus. Material obtained by dilution precipitation of yolk and subsequent removal of lipid by extraction procedures was round to contain around 1% phosphorus.</description><creator>Mok, Chi-Ching.</creator><contributor>Common, R.

The method of inducing pancreatitis was basically that described by Elliott in 1958, as modified by Haig in this laboratory last year. It is most important in experimental pancreatitis to obtain a uniform and reproducible experimental preparation. To achieve this objective, all possible variable factors must be eliminated. Haig noted that one very significant variable was the pre-operative preparation of the dog, in particular, the pre-operative nutrition; and that there was a direct correlation between optimum nutrition and a severe and lethal pancreatitis.

Alter removal of the lignin, fractional extractions and precipitations with aqueous alkali gave an arabinoglucuronoxylan (8% of the wood), a galactoglucomannan (2%) and a glucomannan (8%). Their structure was determined by the classical methylation method, by oxidation with periodate and by identification of the oligosaccharides obtained on partial acid hydrolysis of the polysaccharides. The xylan consisted of B-(1--&gt;4)-linked D-xylose residues carrying a-(1--&gt;2) linked 4-0-ethylglucuronic acid and a-(1--&gt;3)-linked L-arabinofuranose side chains. The two hexosans contained a framework of B-(1--&gt;4)-linked D-glucose and D-mannose residues to which were attached a-(1--&gt;6)-linked D-galactopyranose residues. Both hemicelluloses contained glucose and mannose in a ratio of 1:3 but the galactoglucomannan possessed ten times more galactose side chains than the glucomannan. An oligosaccharide giving equimolar amounts of galactose, glucose, and mannose on hydrolysis was obtained from the galactoglucomannan. This constituted the first unequivocal evidence for the triheteropolymer nature of this type of wood polysaccharide.</description><creator>Mills, Alan. R.</creator><contributor>Timell, T.

Beck's work exploited the idea of blood redistribution and popularized this procedure. Vineberg, working with the principle that bringing new blood to the heart was more important, developed the Ivalon sponge operation. In this experimental study, an attempt was made to show if the combination of these two principles might add benefit to each individual revascularization procedure. Secondly, some details of the Ivalon sponge operation were evaluated.</description><creator>Mercier, Claude.</creator><contributor>Vineberg, A.

First however, it will be advisable to make a few preliminary remarks. It will be admitted right from the start that there is something quite unusual about the form of words "Abe’s motive for killing Sam was that he wanted Sam's money". In fact we seldom use the word “motive" in everyday discourse. It is more usual to ask not "What was x's motive for doing that?” but "Why did X do that?", and more usual to reply not "X's motive was such and such" but "X did it because of such and such".</description><creator>Melzack, Julian.

Central banking operations commenced in the following year. From 1935 monetary management, in the modern sense of a central bank playing a key role in the financial affairs of a country, has characterized Canadian economic development. It has been argued that the Bank of Canada in the early years of its existence did not at all times function at that high level of performance that is generally expected of institutions of that sort. But it would not be unreasonable to associate the early deficiencies of Canadian central banking with the growing pains of a fledgling institution.</description><creator>McLeod, Donald.</creator><contributor>Levitt, K.

The males are sexually mature at 17 to 18 months of age; the first conception in the majority of females occurs during the third and fourth breeding season after birth. Mature bulls are in breeding condition from mid-September until early December. The rutting period extends from mid-October to the first week in November, mainly from October 20 to 25. The blastocyst implants about 27 to 29 days after mating. The corpus luteum attains its maximum size and vascularity at the time of implantation; retrogressive changes commence about 2 months prepartum.</description><creator>McEwan, Eoin.

The problem has been idealized to an interacting electron gas imbedded in a uniform background of positive charge, the lattice of positive ions. The whole system is then neutral. For most metals this is fairly representative of the actual situation. As early as 1934, Wigner suggested the importance of the "correlation energy", a term introduced by him.</description><creator>Matz, Detlef.</creator><contributor>Wallace, P.

The aid of specialists for the difficult task of identifying the animals normally round in the soil, also, is almost indispensable (Alvarado and Selga, 1962).
