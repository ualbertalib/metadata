Since understanding of the hafnium-hydrochloric acid solution is important, development of a speciation diagram for such a solution was carried out. While both Cyanex 923 and 925 are mixtures of trialkyl phosphine oxides, the trialkyl group in the former have straight chains, while those in the latter have branched chains. Experimentally, the major variables studied were hydrochloric acid, hafnium and Cyanex concentrations. Hafnium is rapidly loaded as the tetrachloride complex by a solvation reaction forming a disolvate with the extractant (923 or 925). While extraction increases with increasing acid concentration, it decreases with increasing hafnium concentration due to polymerization. Total chloride level is the controlling factor provided there is enough acid to prevent hafnium hydrolysis and polymerization. Cyanex 923 is a more powerful extractant than Cyanex 925 for given conditions. A few experiments have shown that a very dilute hydrochloric acid solution is suitable as a stripping agent. The main objective is to evaluate the potential of Cyanex 923 (or 925) as an alternative to MIBK due to the problems associated with the latter. MIBK is the conventional extractant for hafnium and zirconium extraction and separation from hydrochloric acid/thiocyanate solutions. Thus, preliminary studies of hafnium and zirconium (existing separately or together) extraction from hydrochloric acid/thiocyanate solutions were also performed. When existing separately, hafnium and zirconium are similarly extracted into either Cyanex reagents, but when both metals coexist in the same solution, preferential separation of hafnium is observed.</description><creator>El-Ammouri, Elias G.</creator><contributor>Distin, P.

Robots are used increasingly in the manufacturing industry because of their flexibility. In the electronics packaging industry, there are many instances where one wants to do a two point continuity test. These two points can be anywhere on a given card. This application is the perfect candidate for a robotic implementation using two robots. However, challenges involve designing an appropriate workcell and figuring out how to have the two robots work together. Both of these problems were addressed in this research project. The thesis begins by exposing the initial environment and then it outlines an enhanced solution that was adopted for both the workcell design and the motion planning. Some test results for the motion planner are then presented. A workcell such as the one presented here has actually been developed and is currently being used in some manufacturing operations.</description><creator>Dubois, Vincent</creator><contributor>Malowany, A.

Firstly, chickens were used as a model system to test the possibility of using microsatellite DNA as a probe for DNA fingerprinting in inbreeding analysis. Six genetic groups of chickens with estimated coefficients of inbreeding ranging from 0.026 to $&gt;$ 0.98 (pedigree analysis) were fingerprinted using the minisatellite probe derived from M13 and the microsatellite probe (CAC)$ sb5$. The degree of band sharing using either probe increased in concert with the known amount of inbreeding and was described by the equation Y = 0.56X ($ pm$0.06) + 0.42 ($ pm$0.03); r = 0.998. Since in-gel hybridization using the microsatellite probes was faster and less labour intensive than using the minisatellite probe, it was used in the subsequent studies. Pedigree analysis in Holstein dairy cattle allowed for the empirical calibration of the association of band sharing with the coefficient of relatedness, (r), defined as the expected proportion of genes in 2 individuals that are identical by descent (i.e. for monozygous twins r = 1; for first order relatives r = 0.5; for half sibs r = 0.25 etc.). The average band sharing between pairs (6 pairs at each r value) of individuals within each class formed the basis for calibration. DNA was digested using RsaI. The relationship between band sharing and relatedness was well represented by a linear approximation Y = 0.51X ($ pm$0.09) + 0.50 ($ pm$0.04); r = 0.992. Using this calibration curve, random samples of animals within herds can be tested to establish the herd variability and to minimize inbreeding.</description><creator>Li, Suiyang</creator><contributor>Zadworny, D.

Israel's sovereignty is a fait accompli. The geo-political form of Palestinian self-determination is to be shaped by both parties, taking into account regional reality and international law. This study serves as a modest examination of the application of certain international law concepts in settling two conflicting national aspirations within a unique factual context. The main theoretical definitions of self-determination and its legal status in international law are first reviewed, along with the socio-juridical aspect of nationhood. The analysis of those topics constitutes a starting point for discussing basic Palestinian legal arguments related to Israel's right to exist, as well as to the scope of Palestinian national entity. The abandonment of "armed struggle" as a legitimate course of action, and of Palestinian legal claims justifying a hostile policy against Israel, are necessary pre-conditions for co-existence, in which each nation determines its political fate. Another vital element for the realization of such a modus vivendi is the development of a relationship built on trust. A restrained application of Palestinian self-determination might be necessary in the interim. The complete expression of Palestinian free will is, for many, still a utopian idea. Its achievement is largely dependant upon the negation of Palestinian legal claims which are aimed at the invalidation of Israel as a legitimate, sovereign state.</description><creator>Raz, Edny</creator><contributor>Toope, S.

The inotropic effect of methoxamine decreased to adult levels at 3 weeks so that in tissues from rats 3 weeks and older, its inotropic effect was significantly less than that of isoprenaline. The inotropic effect of isoprenaline was not age-dependent. The inotropic effect of methoxamine was antagonized by prazosin and that of isoprenaline by propranolol. Treatment of pups at birth with dexamethasone, triiodothyronine or 6-hydroxydopamine did not influence that inotropic effect of methoxamine. Radioligand binding studies using $ sp3$(H) -prazosin and $ sp3$(H) -dihydroalprenolol as ligands and phentolamine and propranolol as displacers, respectively, revealed no age-dependent differences in myocardial $ alpha sb1$- and $ beta sp1$-adrenoceptor density or affinity. As well the increase in the second messenger inositol triphosphate (IP$ sb3$) after methoxamine was less in neonatal than in adult hearts. It is concluded that a greater inotropic effect of $ alpha sb1$-adrenoceptor agonists in neonatal rats may be due to unusual receptor-response coupling, which remains to be identified.</description><creator>Inayatulla, Arjumand Bano</creator><contributor>Varma, D.

The caregivers in the study included an older more traditional mother, a younger less traditional mother, and a teenage sibling caregiver. Videotaped samples of naturalistic interaction between the Inuit caregivers and children were coded for communicative intent using the Inventory of Communicative Acts-Abridged (Ninio, Wheeler, Snow, Pan, &amp; Rollins, 1991). Preliminary comparisons between the Inuit data and the results of studies of white middle-class caregiver-child interaction were also assessed. Results of the study demonstrate that there are differences in caregiver-child interaction within the Inuit culture and between the Inuit and the white-middle class culture. The implications of these findings for interactionist theories of language acquisition such as Bruner's Language Acquisition Support System (1981, 1985) are discussed.</description><creator>Hough-Eyamie, Wendy P.

Significant differences were found in the speech and gesture characteristics of the narratives of stutterers as compared to fluent controls on a cartoon retelling task. Stutterers produced fewer cartoon details in their speech and fewer meanings per gesture. As well, stutterers were unable to begin a representational gesture at the same moment as a stuttered disfluency resulting in the freezing of gestures or maintaining the hand at rest. A second experiment showed that stutterers were able to maintain and initiate non-communicative hand movements at the same moment as stuttering. Gesture did not replace speech during moments of stuttering even though manual movement during stuttering was possible. The results demonstrate the strength of the speech-gesture relationship and show that stuttering affects both modalities of expression.</description><creator>Scoble, Joselynne</creator><contributor>Mayberry, R.

Fluoxetine (60 mg/day by mouth, n = 10) or placebo (n = 10) were administered during 3 weeks of inpatient VLCD followed by 8 weeks of outpatient BDD in a double-blind, randomized design. A similar amount of weight was lost in both groups during the VLCD, but by the end of the BDD total weight loss in the fluoxetine group was significantly greater (11.0 $ pm$ 1.1 kg vs. 7.0 $ pm$ 1.0 kg, mean $ pm$ SEM, p $&lt;$ 0.015). Resting metabolic rate (RMR) increased by 4.4 $ pm$ 1.8% (p $&lt;$ 0.01) in the fluoxetine group but did not change in the placebo group during the first week of the VLCD, but subsequently decreased significantly in both groups as dieting continued. However, RMR remained consistently higher in the fluoxetine group for the duration of the VLCD period. No further change in RMR occurred in either group during the BDD period. The thermic effect of food did not change after VLC dieting plus fluoxetine or placebo treatment. Body temperature increased within 2 days of fluoxetine treatment by a mean of 0.3$ sp circ$C, p $&lt;$ 0.025 and remained elevated throughout the VLCD but was unchanged in the placebo group. VLCD therapy reduced serum levels of T$ sb3$, free T$ sb3$ Index and 24-hour urinary excretion of dopamine, norepinephrine, metanephrine and normetanephrine equivalently in both groups. A thermogenic effect of fluoxetine is demonstrated in humans for the first time. The anorectic effect of fluoxetine may be related to its temperature elevating effect.</description><creator>Bross, Rachelle</creator><contributor>Hoffer, L.

The following thesis examines Saint-Pierre in this light, showing how it was created as a reaction against the imposing and manipulative natures of both a reductive perspective manifestation of art, and a dogmatic form of ritual. These themes, being particular to modern art, may be seen as a desire for a more accessible and individual participation. The reading of Saint-Pierre proceeds on three levels, addressing divergent aspects of the work's nature, ranging from its formal character, to its symbolism split between the natural and cultural realms. Each level contributes to the image of an open place of worship, that is, an accessible architectural setting intended to frame an individual and inward form of worship. This reading also reveals the inherent conflict involved in attempting to reconcile a monumental disposition--evident at Saint-Pierre and understood as forming part of the poetic integrity of the work--with the accessibility that tends to compromise such integrity. This points to the problematic nature of monumental architecture in modern society.</description><creator>Venier, Claudio</creator><date>1993</date><subject>Saint-Pierre de Firminy-Vert (Church)</subject><subject>Church buildings -- France -- Firminy.</subject><subject>Le Corbusier, 1887-1965</subject><title>Ideas on perspective and ritual : the open and individual nature of Le Corbusier's Firminy Church</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/37720d622.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/000000859</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:tx31qj52t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:48:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The most severe problem for the vacuum arc deposition (VAD) technique is the formation of micron-size particles on the films. These particles degrade the films' properties. The present work studied the generation mechanisms and characteristics of the droplets that are produced in the carbon films deposited by vacuum arc technique. To achieve a better control of the generation mechanism of these droplets, the effect of the arc current, arc duration time, cathode spot temperature and distance between cathode and substrate on the size and population of the micro-droplets are studied. The micro-droplets are in the range of 0.3 $ mu$m to 2 $ mu$m in diameter, and have a graphite structure. The most probable origin for these particles are the cathode. The size and population of these particles are directly proportional to the cathode spot temperature (i.e., to the arc current and/or arc duration time), and inversely proportional to the distance between the cathode and the substrate. The droplet production is mainly due to the heating effect.</description><creator>Kandah, Munther</creator><contributor>Meunier, J. L.

The city started to pay attention to the Italian mainland, developing its agriculture and other industries. But the Veneto was marshy and needed to be drained and improved. The Venetian and mainland aristocracy gradually abandoned commerce for agriculture and land reclamation. Andrea Palladio built many villas for them from which they could administer their estates, transforming the marshes of the Veneto into sites for the villas.

It consists of quartz-calcite stockworks and breccias, associated with potassic (K-feldspar + sericite) alteration of dacitic tuff host rocks. Ore grade mineralization occurs mainly in Bonanza-style breccias which host acanthite, electrum and native silver, associated with pyrite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, galena, chlorite and hematite. However, Shasta lacks vein-hosted adularia, and the highest grades of ore are associated with calcite-rich breccias, which are features atypical of the adularia-sericite class. Hydrothermal breccias, chalcedonic quartz and abundant vapour rich fluid inclusions are strong evidence for boiling of the vein fluid. Fluid inclusion evidence indicates that ore was deposited between 280$ sp circ$ and 225$ sp circ$C at a maximum depth of 750 m, from a relatively dilute hydrothermal fluid. Oxygen and hydrogen isotopic data suggest that the fluid was meteoric in origin. Initial log fO$ sb2$ - pH conditions were estimated to have been between $-$33 to $-$31, and 4.25 to 6, respectively, and to have increased during mineralization. A model is proposed in which quartz, and subsequently calcite and silver-gold minerals, were deposited due to boiling of the fluid. The consequent decrease in temperature and increase in pH controlled deposition of quartz and calcite, respectively. Precipitation of silver and gold was caused by a combination of increased pH and oxygen fugacity, and a decrease in H$ sb2$S fugacity.</description><creator>Thiersch, Peter C.</creator><contributor>Jones, Williams (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Geology.</subject><subject>Mineralogy.</subject><title>Mineralization and ore controls of the Shasta Ag-Au deposit, Toodoggone river area, British Columbia</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hh63sw679.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pc289j83c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ws859g53g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:48:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Batemi are an agropastoral group who inhabit a semi-arid area in Northwestern Tanzania. The group lives a traditional subsistence lifestyle and are therefore dependent on the resources that surround them. This study: (1) investigates their use of woody vegetation; (2) studies the abundance and distribution of woody vegetation in the area; and (3) experiments with assigning use values to species and with employing these use values to identify conservation priorities. The Batemi utilize over 100 woody species, in 37 families' and 58 genera, from the environment surrounding their villages for construction, fuel, implements, services, food and medicine. Random sampling and systematic inventories in the valley showed that the most abundant species are Croton dictygamous and Acacia tortilis. Land cover in the area can be classed into three main vegetation types using a polythetic divisive program, TWINSPAN and these types are linked to three habitat types: hillside, plain and riverine. A landcover map for the area was produced from Landsat TM digital data. Based on density of woody vegetation, four categories were chosen for the final map product: thicket, woodland, wooded grassland, and grassland. To establish conservation priorities, use values are assigned based on importance of a use, number of species that can fulfill that use, and the rate of consumption. These values, when compared to abundance, provide a framework for considering conservation priorities. Based on various methods, Acacia mellifera and Haplocoelum folioosum are identified as two species that may require special attention.</description><creator>Smith, Wynet</creator><contributor>Meredith, T.

The data set included verbatim e-mail and fax transcripts, instructor interviews, course syllabi and course assignments. Triangulation procedures were followed to examine the following within the context of two distance education courses with very different learning goals: (1) the general instructional purposes for which the technologies were used; (2) the levels of learning reflected in the mediated interactions; and (3) the relationship between the use of the technology, the instructors' perceptions of its use and the stated learning outcomes of the courses. Electronic-mail provided the interaction necessary for encouraging discussions of course content in the Instructional Design course, whereas fax was used more for the transmission of knowledge in both courses. An examination of the relationship between course learning objectives, course transcripts, and instructor interviews indicated that the instructors were consistent in their view of the different communication technologies,. their purpose for using the chosen technology, and the way in which they used the specific communication technology. However, this consistency was not reflected in the students' use of the communication technologies since the students responded only at Bloom's lower levels of learning even though the instructors used all levels of learning.

More specifically, it investigated the importance attached to victory versus play elements, specific motives for playing, as well as Machiavellian behaviour during play in eight different forms of ice hockey. The sample consisted of 214 players in hockey forms ranging from the least structured and organised, such as "pick-up hockey", to that of the highly competitive inter-university variety. The Ideal-Type Play/Game Paradigm, proposed by Salter (1980), was used as a basis to investigate players' importance attached to victory versus play elements. To study specific motives for participation and Machiavellian behaviour across hockey forms, a Participation Questionnaire was developed by the investigator. Results indicate that, as the activity became more structured and organised: (1) the importance of victory as compared to play elements became more pronounced (F = 11.09, p $&lt;$.001); (2) motives changed (F = 5.55, p $&lt;$.05); and (3) Machiavellian tendencies increased (F = 50.71, p $&lt;$.001). Results further indicate that, across hockey forms: (1) achievement/status (F = 22.68, p =.00) and skill development (F = 22.29, p =.00) motives increased in importance with structure and organisation for play; (2) excitement/challenge (F = 4.58, p =.00) and social affiliation (F = 3.85, p =.00) motives changed somewhat; and (3) fun (F = 2.38, p =.02), team affiliation (F = 3.25, p =.00) and energy release (F = 2.26, p =.03) motives were fairly common and important. It was also found that to improve fitness as a motive for participating was not a significant discriminator since it was felt to be important by players in all hockey forms.

After some theoretical clarifications over the two different views of the inflationary dynamics, (i.e. the monetary and the fiscal view), an accurate picture of the inflationary structures of the industrial and the financial sector will be made. Then the various factors (other than the January's price liberalization) responsible for the persistence of the high level of inflation in the country will be systematically studied (i.e. firms' soft budget constraint, indexation mechanisms and inflation inertia process, dollarization and depreciation of the ruble, and the use of seigniorage by the government). An anti-inflationary program including an efficient bankruptcy law, a tax-payment and government-bond indexation, is proposed. However, political pressures coming from various coalitions hostile to the economic reform are viewed as what activate the inflationary process in Russia.</description><creator>Houle, Martin</creator><contributor>Zinde-Walsh, Victoria (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Inflation (Finance) -- Russia</subject><title>Nature and dynamics of the inflationary process in Russia</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pc289j84n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8g84mn08v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Economics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k35695363</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:48:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The development of the French language in Quebec has been the subject of various articles both in the popular press and in professional journals. Our study examines the French identification process in the context of the theoretical framework of social identity. The concept of identification is defined according to the notions of attachment to French language and of open-mindedness to the English language. This study presents some of the factors which influence the linguistic identification process. It also compares this identification between 1978 and 1990 among French Quebec students in high school and college. Most precisely, we examine and compare the relative influence of factors such as the objective ethnolinguistic vitality of the respondent and his linguistic usages and abilities. We also look at the concept of subjective vitality which is based on the respondent's attitudes and beliefs regarding the present and future situation of French language in Quebec.</description><creator>Gravel, Ronald Gaston</creator><contributor>Locher, Uli (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>French language -- Social aspects -- Québec (Province)</subject><subject>French-Canadians -- Québec (Province) -- Ethnic identity.</subject><title>Vitalité linguistique et identification francophone des jeunes Québécois</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vd66w072v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k35695363</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Sociology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6108vc238</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:48:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis examines, from a feminist perspective, conceptions of the body proposed by poststructuralist philosophy and postmodernist art practice. Within both feminist and postmodern critiques of the humanist subject, the body has come to be understood as a site of cultural inscriptions. In tracing the relationship between postmodernism and feminism, the thesis addresses specifically the shift from celebratory, affirmative female imagery typical of feminist art in the seventies, to the semiotic analysis of images of women which, in the eighties, problematized the question of sexual difference as one of representation. During the eighties women artists generally eschewed figurative representations of the female body in recognition of its over-determined socio-sexual status. Within this historical framework, the tension between the "de-materialized" body of postmodernity and the insistently present body of gendered experience is explored both in the work of feminist theorists and contemporary women artists. In conclusion, three corporeal sites--the cultural, the epistemological and the psycho-sexual--are analysed in the postmodern practices of Jana Sterbak, Nell Tenhaaf and Kati Campbell.</description><creator>Bradley, Jessica</creator><date>1993</date><subject>Postmodernism</subject><subject>Feminism and art</subject><subject>Women in art</subject><subject>Women artists</subject><title>Postmodern bodies and feminist art practice</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0c483k14n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6108vc238</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Graduate Communications Program</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sq87bv42f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:48:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The goal of this study was to examine theory of mind and deliberate rule use in children with Down syndrome as compared to children of normal intelligence. Theory of mind was defined as the ability to understand that other people have thoughts, beliefs and desires. Deliberate rule use was considered to be the extent to which children were able to learn and subsequently switch between a set of ad hoc rules unrelated to mental states. Participants included 10 individuals with Down syndrome and 10 individuals of normal intelligence matched for mental age. The primary finding of this study was that individuals with Down syndrome do not possess a theory of mind at a mental age of 5 years. Furthermore, individuals with Down syndrome possess domain specific knowledge of embedded rules, whereas, individuals with normal intelligence apply an embedded rule structure that effects mental and non-mental state tasks equally. The embedded rule use of individuals with Down syndrome was characterized by: (a) an inability to effectively use embedded rules in theory of mind and deductive card sort tasks; and, (b) the ability to use embedded rules in a task assessing physical causality.</description><creator>Benedetto, Elizabeth-Anne</creator><contributor>Burack, Jacob (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Down syndrome -- Psychological aspects.</subject><title>Theory of mind and deliberate rule use in individuals with Down syndrome</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sb397915q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sq87bv42f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9p290b28w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:48:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis examines the writing in poetry and prose of a small group of English feminist writers of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. The best known of these authors was Mary Astell (1666-1731). The influence on the feminists' ideas of the philosophies of Descartes and of the most prominent English thinkers of the period, the Cambridge Platonists, is described. The thesis focuses on three main themes in the seventeenth century feminists' writing. These were occupation, education and marriage. Emphasis is put on education as the most important of the feminists' concerns. They believed that the poor education women received in comparison with that received by men put women at a disadvantage in society in general and in personal relationships with men. They also believed that education was vital for personal happiness and spiritual fulfillment. In their writing about occupation, the feminists stated that the things that middle and upper class women were expected to do were unfulfilling. They wanted the right to occupy themselves with reading and writing without facing ridicule. On the subject of marriage the feminists' main concern also centred around education. They believed that women were at a disadvantage in the marriage relationship because they were not as well educated as their husbands. They thought that more equitable marriages were desirable, and that they would exist if women were better educated.</description><creator>Bethune, Carol</creator><contributor>Maxwell, M. P.
