Kinetics expressions were derived for soda-amine, kraft (soda-hydrosulfide ion) and soda-ethanol delignification under isothermal conditions over various ranges of additive charge. In each case, the total delignification observed after a given time of pulping could be described as the sum or two contributions: (i) that due to the sodium hydroxide alone, and (ii) that due to the additive (AQ, amine, hydrosulfide ion or ethanol). Rate constants were determined at various temperatures and apparent Arrhenius activation energies were calculated for soda-AQ, soda-amine and kraft delignification. Although the calculated activation energies were found to be similar, the forms of kinetic expressions obtained suggested that the role of AQ in alkaline delignification may differ from that of an amine or hydrosulfide ion. The effects of various combinations of additive pairs on delignification were investigated and the results suggested that interactions occur. Under certain conditions, delignification in soda-AQ-amine and kraft-AQ liquors, respectively, could be described as the sum of the effects of the sodium hydroxide alone, the amine or hydrosulfide ion, and a term dependent upon the anthraquinone.</description><creator>Rivers, J.

This structure and style are the necessary consequences of an artistic vision that is self-consciously Christian and evangelical. After a brief discussion of the problem of belief and literature, the dissertation presents Wiebe's Anabaptist theology and examines the typological and parabolical means by which Christian beliefs can become a method of composition. Wiebe's project is to create a fiction in which realistically presented lives and actions exist consubstantially with the gospel of Jesus. A pervasive iconic imagery and ironic reference result in a carefully controlled evangelical "sentence," one which allows Wiebe a fictional re-enactment of the incarnation. In Peace Shall Destroy Many, First and Vital Candle, and The Blue Mountains of China. Wiebe experiments with retrospective typology and with analogical sacrificial actions. In the historical novels (The Temptations of Big Bear, The Scorched-Wood People, The Mad Trapper), he exploits typology proper, giving epistemological authority to his chronicles of faith by establishing the hermeneutical divide in history itself. The gospel is again present, but now it is almost entirely anticipatory and ironic. The dissertation concludes by speculating about Wiebe's latest experiment in evangelical fiction, the self-regarding dramatization of a Christian Wiebe-persona acting in a documentary present.</description><creator>Hildebrand, George H.</creator><date>1982</date><subject>Wiebe, Rudy Henry, 1934- -- Symbolism.</subject><subject>Jesus Christ -- In literature.</subject><subject>Wiebe, Rudy Henry, 1934- -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><title>The Anabaptist vision of Rudy Wiebe : a study in theological allegoresis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9593tv939.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qv33rx529</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:b2773w54c</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:33:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Although the Maximes as we know them are the original work of the duc of La Rochefoucauld, Jacques Esprit and Mme de Sable contributed to the first versions of the text. At one time, the three friends even talked of regrouping their contributions in one volume. However, little by little, the "common collection" seems to contain only the reflexions of La Rochefoucauld, and Mme de Sable and Jacques Esprit decide to become writers in their own right. So, while the marquise chooses also to write "maximes", Esprit prefers a moral treatise on the falseness of human vertus, La Faussete des vertus humaines. Having become writers, Esprit and Mme de Sable nonetheless produce second-rate works, while only La Rochefoucauld produces the masterpiece known as the Maximes. Our study traces the phenomenon of the artistic literary work which emerges from what began as a collective effort. Through a historical, thematic and stylistic approach, we establish different elements which contribute to the fundamental originality of La Rochefoucauld's Maximes.</description><creator>Liebich, Christine Renée.</creator><contributor>van Delft, Louis (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1982</date><subject>Esprit, Mr. (Jacques), 1611-1678 -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><subject>Sablé, Madeleine de Souvré, marquise de, 1599-1678 -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><subject>La Rochefoucauld, François, duc de, 1613-1680.

Recipient of a unique education, Mill was trained to uphold a reformist ideology, Benthamite Utilitarianism. The secular biases thus instilled were greatly reinforced by his own inductivist outlook in epistemology. But Mill's sensitive mind succumbed to other influences too, especially after his "crisis". Based on a review of these key contextual factors, the ensuing study highlights (1) the persistence of a religious interest throughout Mill's career, (2) the sceptical (yet undogmatic) character of his religious thinking, and (3) the later Mill's drift towards a more sympathetic interpretation of religion. It is also emphasized that although his views are challengeable, they retain some relevance to contemporary discussion, and again, that Mill frequently emerges as a more perceptive analyst of religion than either Hume or Marx. Offered as a contribution to the study of religious thought, this dissertation is also intended to fill a certain gap in modern scholarship on the 19th century's most influential English philosophic writer.</description><creator>Rajapakse, Vijithasena.</creator><contributor>McKinnon, Alastair (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1982</date><subject>Mill, John Stuart, 1806-1873 -- Religion.</subject><title>A study of the religious thought of John Stuart Mill /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pk02cb74w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0k225b93k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Philosophy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:m900nv426</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:33:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Single Factor market Model is an important tool in contemporary research in finance. The assumption of parametric stability is usually invoked to facilitate statistical estimation of the model. Much of the importance of the model follows from its "beta" parameter which, ideally, measures the sensitivity of returns on a security to changes in a market factor. While stability of this parameter is desirable, this property is neither required nor expected from financial theory. Instances of nonstationarity are commonly observed. The objective of this thesis is to address, theoretically and empirically, the nature and causes of potential instability. To this end, analytical models are derived for the beta parameter. These models predict that the intertemporal behaviour of parametric estimates is characterized by information-related structural shifts and seemingly random perturbations. These predictions are given empirical support. Structural shifts are observed in conjunction with pre-selected information flows; a random component of the beta parameter is identified. The implications of these findings are considered.</description><creator>Riding, Allan Lance.</creator><date>1982</date><subject>Finance -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Finance -- Research.</subject><subject>Econometrics -- Mathematical models.</subject><title>Stability of the market model beta coefficient : effects of information</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20st48z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m900nv426</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Management</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bz60cx23p</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:33:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Export performance of the individual firm is the focus of this research. Performance (export growth and export level) is thought to be a function of export strategies and firm and managerial determinants. Export strategies are defined a priori and relevant firm determinants selected through a literature survey. Primary data was collected from 142 firms of the electronics industry in Canada. The findings are: (1) export growth and export level are virtually independent gauges of export performance; (2) the sets of determinants for the two gauges of export performance are different; (3) export performance is fairly well explained by the selected determinants; (4) export performance is strategy specific: world oriented marketers perform best, U.S. oriented sellers perform worst; (5) characteristics of the firms that adopt each specific strategy differ.

The activities of material production are generated in the dialectical relation of experience to Cree structures of thought. Reciprocity amounts to a paradigm for Cree thought, informing models of both ecological and social relations. The effect of material relations on structural transformations is viewed in discursive genres of several levels, ranging from everyday dialogue to mythico-ritual symbolism. Special attention is paid to four categories of "persons" which have been of consuming interest to the natural and social science of the Crees: Canada geese, black bears, Crees, and "White Men".</description><creator>Scott, Colin H.

It is a clarification of how different interpretations of the concept of time intervene in the process of building economic models and in analysing problems of change. It discusses how various interpretations of the notion of time lead to different forms of Economic Dynamics which are not necessarily compatible with each other. This perplexing question of time is made concrete by the analysis of the writing of an eminent modern economist, Sir John Hicks. He has been very much concerned with the treatment of time in economic theory. The methods he used to try and deal with time in economic analysis, together with his commentaries on the issue, will serve to illustrate the difficulties involved.</description><creator>Hamouda, Omar.</creator><date>1982</date><subject>Hicks, John Richard, Sir, 1904-</subject><subject>Economics.</subject><subject>Time.</subject><title>The treatment of time in the theoretical writings of Sir John Hicks /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fj236292b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/db78tc95w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Economics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:td96k3416</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:33:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><creator>Cole, Kenneth Chesley</creator><date>1974</date><subject>Chemistry, Organic.</subject><subject>Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.</subject><subject>Cyclic compounds.</subject><title>Structural studies of some small-ring compounds by nematic phase nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9306t0128.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/td96k3416</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3484zh647</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:33:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><creator>Attwood, Donald William</creator><date>1974</date><subject>Entrepreneurship.</subject><subject>India -- Economic conditions.</subject><title>Political entrepreneurs and economic development: two villages and a taluka in Western India</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xw42n886x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3484zh647</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anthropology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6682x486s</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:33:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Canada's volunteer military faces a major manning problem. High attrition rates reflect youth indifference to military service, and research indicates that the manpower pool from which recruits are drawn will shrink significantly in the next two decades, exacerbating an already difficult situation. This thesis reports on the first part of a two phase study investigating some of the variables and the dynamics underlying training attrition. In this phase three personality inventories, Holland's Vocational Preference Inventory (VPI), Levenson's Locus of Control Scale (LCS), and Super's Work Values Inventory (WVI) were related to four discrete categories of attrition and to several composite attrition criteria. In addition, Holland's personality-environment congruence hypothesis was tested. Two distinct samples were used: military recruits, and their supervising Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs). The recruit sample consisted of 795, 17-25 year old, males who successfully completed Canadian Forces Basic Training without being recoursed, as well as 185 recruits grouped into four discrete and three composite attrition categories. The NCO sample consisted of the 30 Squad NCOs in charge of training the recruit sample. Both recruit and NCO samples were administered questionnaires prior to the start of training. The questionnaires, contained the personality inventories indicated, as well as measures of variables to be analyzed in the second phase of this study. Statistical analysis was carried out using (chi)('2), ANOVA, and point biserial corrrelations. Since this was a field study, the level of significance utilized was p &lt; .05. Three of four hypotheses were supported: (a) Recruits who share congruent LCS personality types with their Squad NCO and the modal squad personality type had lower attrition rates, supporting Holland's congruency hypothesis. (b) As a group, recruits with Realistic, Investigative and Conventional personality types, were more congruent with the squad environments, and exhibited significantly less attrition than Artistic, Social and Enterprising types, supporting the congruency hypothesis, and the use of Holland's theory in the analysis of vocational change. (c) A postulated difference in attrition between LCS personality types, Internals, Externals-Chance and External-Powerful Others, was not supported by the data. However, recruits in one of the composite attrition categories scored significantly higher on the External-Chance sub-scale of Levenson's LCS, suggesting poorer adaptation among those who believe that chance has a controlling effect on their lives. (d) Several work values were negatively correlated with the various attrition categories, possibly an outcome of the modal "blue collar" orientation of the sample. However, the "life style" value correlated positively with those who were passing and requested release and the "surroundings" value correlated positively with those who were failing and requested release, suggesting a consistent relationship between certain work values and attrition categories. Overall results confirm the usefulness of utilizing multiple, discrete, and composite attrition criteria and of investigating attrition from a micro-environmental perspective. The study also supports Holland's personality-environment congruence hypothesis, and suggests a consistent relationship between personality variables and attrition.</description><creator>Lefroy, Donald A.

The prototype lens consists of a pair of concentric circular metal electrodes plated on the interface between a piezoelectric solid and a liquid medium. These two circular electrodes excite Rayleigh waves of velocity V(,R) which are converging towards the common centre but which are phase matched to the compressional waves of the velocity V(,c) in the liquid in a very narrow range of zenith angle about a value given by (phi)(,m) = sin('-1)V(,c)/V(,R). The waves radiated into the liquid are thus in the form of a hollow cone converging onto a common focal spot on the lens axis at a distance determined by this zenith angle and the radius of the electrodes. This planar acoustic microscope lens is called the Rayleigh-to-Compressional Conversion (RCC) lens. Since the lens behavior is determined by the geometry of the electrodes and because of the simplicity of the photolithographic fabrication process of the RCC lens, more complicated configurations can be made as easily as the prototype; for example, semicircular lenses have been produced and analyzed. A mathematical analysis based on a spatial impulse of stress applied on the solid/liquid boundary has been used to calculate the focussing characteristics of the RCC lens. For isotropic solid not only the particle displacements of the compressional wave in the liquid have been computed, but also that of the waves radiated into the solid. For anisotropic solids only the radiation pattern of the compressional wave in the liquid, which is the one of most interesting, has been investigated using an isotropic equivalent model. In the model the circular shape of the electrodes has been considered to consist of many line segments and it has been used to analyze the focal properties of partial circles and anisotropic substrate. This planar acoustic microscope lens has been employed in standard transmission and reflection imaging experiments to demonstrate the structure of its focal spot and in particular the lack of spherical aberration when traversing a metal surface. Because of the hollow conical nature of the beam away from the focal region the RCC lens is inherently adapted to dark field microscopy. Some properties of the semicircular lens are also given as examples in linear and nonlinear operation. The operating frequency in the experiments ranges from 10 to 120 MHz, but. a lens with higher operating. frequences have been fabricated. Tne limitations on the upper frequency of the RCC lens seem to be similar to those for the spherical concave acoustic microscope lenses, namely the insertion loss associated with the propagation loss in the liquid.</description><creator>Jen, C.

Global rainfall estimates must therefore be provided largely by satellites, particularly those exploiting atmospheric windows in the visible/IR and microwave regimes. A 2-D pattern matching technique using visible and IR data is proposed and its accuracy investigated. Because these wavelengths respond primarily to cloud and not rain sized drops, significant accuracy may be achieved in rain areas, but not directly in amounts. However, when long term average rain rates for raining areas are used, errors of (TURN) (+OR-) 49% for 10('5) km('2) are achieved. This compares favorably with other techniques based on cloud life histories. Microwave radiometer-based techniques are also investigated and are found to be fundamentally limited in accuracy ((TURN) (+OR-) 70%) by the large variations in the (unknown) effective rain layer height. However, useful accuracy ((TURN) (+OR-) 20%) may be obtained over large areas ((TURN) 10('5) km('2)), provided that the long term average effective rain layer height is known. It is argued that a once or twice daily satellite rain estimate is insufficient for either accurate estimates of daily accumulation or for samples of climatological rain rates. A hybrid microwave satellite-vis/IR technique is therefore proposed in order to solve the temporal resolution problem without the necessity of orbiting many microwave radiometers. This technique would take advantage of the high ( 1/2 hour) temporal resolution of the vis/IR data and could achieve accuracies of (TURN) (+OR-) 20% for 12 hour accumulations over 10('5) km('2) provided that the mean effective rain layer height is known. The practical implementation of such a technique will ultimately depend on the relative difficulty of measuring the mean effective rain layer height, and the mean rain rate for raining areas as well as the availability of appropriate sensor platforms.</description><creator>Lovejoy, S.

Sulfoconjugated dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine are detected in small quantities, whereas glucuronoconjugation seems to occur only in dopamine, and is by far the predominant form of dopamine conjugation. On the other hand, in man, sulfoconjugation is normally the sole form of catecholamine conjugation. Glucuronoconjugated dopamine constitutes the bulk not only of dopamine, but also of total catecholamines in rat cerebrospinal fluid, plasma and urine, which sharply contrasts with the composition of catecholamines in peripheral tissues where the bulk of total catecholamines is free norepinephrine (in sympathetically innervated tissues) or epinephrine (in adrenals). Sulfo- and glucuronoconjugated catecholamines in rat cerebrospinal fluid are central in origin, whereas the adrenal medulla and peripheral postganglionic sympathetic neurons are important sources of peripheral conjugated catecholamines. In response to stress, rat plasma free catecholamine surges occur with concomitant substantial falls in sulfoconjugated dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine as well as glucuronoconjugated dopamine. Under stress, a large portion of rat plasma conjugated dopamine, mainly glucuronoconjugated dopamine is not only deconjugated to free dopamine, but probably also converted to free norepinephrine and epinephrine. Adrenalectomy abolishes these normal stress-induced responses to plasma conjugated catecholamines in the rat. These findings led to the following conclusions. (1) Glucuronoconjugation is an important pathway in the metabolism of central and peripheral dopamine in the rat. (2) In the metabolism of catecholamines, conjugation is qualitatively distinct from O-methylation and deamination in that conjugation represents an intermediate and reversible process, whereas O-methylatio</description><creator>Wang, Pin-Chang.</creator><date>1982</date><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><title>Physiology of catecholamine conjugation in the rat</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/47429b105.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1g05fc52z</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:w95051356</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:33:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation examines narrative structure in Daniel 1-6 using a method of analysis developed by the Russian folklorist, Vladimir Propp, in his book Morphology of the Folktale. Propp's model for the narrative surface structure of the heroic fairy tale is employed as an analytical tool to assist in the identification of structural features in five individual stories within Daniel 1-6. The results of the study indicate that, although none of the texts has a structure identical to the fairy tale, Propp's model is, nevertheless, helpful for describing the basic structures of four of the five biblical texts examined. The tales in Daniel 1-2 and Daniel 5 have similar structures and may be said to constitute one group, while the tales in Daniel 3 and Daniel 6 have a different structural similarity and form a second group. Daniel 4 is structurally dissimilar to the other tales in Daniel 1-6.</description><creator>Milne, Pamela Jeanne.</creator><date>1982</date><subject>Propp, V. I︠A︡.

We observed an A(,1g) impurity mode (185 cm('-1)) and an electronic transition at 110.5 (+OR-) .8 cm('-1) which we associate with the first excited states of the ferrous ion, (GAMMA)(,3g) and (GAMMA)(,4g), previously observed by far infra-red optical absorption. Crystal field theory and group theory are used to characterize the energy levels and the wavefunctions of the ferrous ion. The observed reduction in the spin-orbit splitting of the energy levels is accounted for by solving the Jahn-Teller Hamiltonian in the approximation of the cluster model. Uniaxial stress applied to the MgO:Fe('2+) samples produced a shift in the observed electronic transitions. The stress Hamiltonian is solved from which is extracted the experimental value of the strain coupling coefficient to E(,g) deformation (V(,2) = 7140 (+OR-) 1800 cm('-1)) which led, ultimately, to the Jahn-Teller coupling coefficients and to the Jahn-Teller energies ((E(,JT))(,E) = 80 cm('-1) and 3/2(E(,JT))(,T) = 150('-1)) pertinent to the ferrous ion in MgO.</description><creator>Poirier, Alain</creator><date>1982</date><subject>Ions -- Spectra.</subject><subject>Raman spectroscopy.</subject><subject>Iron ions.</subject><title>Electronic raman spectroscopy of iron doped MgO</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h128nf55f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4t64gp13k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qn59q4873</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:33:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A satisfactory definition of the imagination has proved elusive in Western philosophy. Two contemporary French thinkers, Gilbert Durand and Paul Ricoeur, are concerned with establishing a fundamental philosophy of imagination. For Durand the imagination is the source of symbolic mediations that are both therapeutic and theophanic. His theory is grounded in a Platonist-esoteric tradition which he supports by a philosophy of the imaginal (coined and articulated by Henry Corbin, a French Islamicist). Ricoeur, in contrast, sees the imagination as a creative cognitive mediator in a dialectic model of knowledge. Within a critical framework the imagination functions at the limits of experience and expression as a catalyst provoking new insights and ways of being. Both theories support a philosophy that rehabilitates the imagination from its former denigrated and suspect categorizations, though Ricoeur's programme is more relevant to contemporary philosophical issues.</description><creator>Joy, Mavourneen M.</creator><date>1981</date><subject>Ricœur, Paul.</subject><subject>Imagination.</subject><subject>Durand, Gilbert, 1921-</subject><title>Towards a philosophy of imagination : a study of Gilbert Durand and Paul Ricoeur</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1c18dg60d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qn59q4873</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Religious Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8k71nh94z</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:33:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The phototactic zoospores of Nowakowskiella elegans (Nowak.)
