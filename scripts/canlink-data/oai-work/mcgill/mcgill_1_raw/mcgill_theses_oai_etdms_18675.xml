The type of weathering undergone by this material and the conditions under which it was deposited. The number of cycles of erosion and deposition represented by the material in the Potsdam sandstone.

This will be attempted by discussing and commentating on the views of a range of Twentieth Century theologians, comparing those who agree with those who are against kenosis. In an age when not only other religions are making themselves a real force in the world, but also when men are apt to make all sorts of differing statements about God, it seemed necessary to the writer to see just what is our Christian claim. Having completed the work of this thesis, the author feels as strongly as he did at the start as to what faith in Our Lord implies. Because of this faith, Chapter I was written and placed first though in a way it should logically be last. It endeavours to set belief that Jesus Christ is unique in a context which can relate to non-Christian men in the world. Chapter II gives a brief survey of the New Testament witness to Jesus. Chapter III gives the early concept of the kenosis theory. Chapter 17 is a review of the Christologies of some leading Twentieth Century theologians, criticising certain details. Chapter 7 concludes this thesis in a context of worship, saying that only a Christology and a conception of God which draw forth the highest devotion of man can be considered satisfactory. It is argued that only a kenotic Christology achieves this object.</description><creator>Thatcher, John F.</creator><date>1964</date><subject>Incarnation -- History of doctrines -- 20th century.</subject><title>Some twentieth century aspects of the Kenosis theory</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x920g1702.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d217qt979</identifier><degree><name>Bachelor of Divinity</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Divinity</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hh63t079w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:35:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The term synergism as applied to a type of action of mixtures of poisons has been diversely interpreted in the literature.

The welfare of the island depends almost entirely on land utilization, and it is to a peculiar degree dependent on the soil. There are no manufactures based on imported raw materials, and the minor manufacturing industries are merely the processing of agricultural products. Moreover, there are no considerable exports other than agricultural commodities. At the same time, farming is in a backward condition.</description><creator>Gordon, Llewelyn.</creator><contributor>Hills, T.

To pay attention to the words of the thinkers of the past, to reflect upon the meaning of their utterances, is this not the mark of a genuine desire to understand what is essential in philosophy, in short, to think? However, the suspicion arises that an interest in philosophy does not yet guarantee that we grasp its authentic meaning; for interest nowadays is directed towards that which is merely "interesting", i.e. that which May soon be dismissed as indifferent in order to make room for something else equally insignificant.</description><creator>Gombay, André.

The stability, in the mammalian organism, of the aromatic nucleus as it occurs in acids of the benzoic series and in alpha-aminophenylacetic acid, in marked contrast to the combustibility of phenylalanine and tyrosine, led Schotten (1883-1884) to the prophetic conclusion.</description><creator>Goldstein, Fred.

The test was conducted at three torques equivalent to a two, four, and six inch brick wall ten feet high resting eccentrically on the bottom plate producing bending and large torsional stresses. Pairs of stiffeners were bolted to the beam at the fifth, quarter, third, and centre points and the effects on the angle of twist, flange, and web stresses studied. The change in position of the neutral plane was also examined. The observed test data was compared with the theoretical based on the Lyse-Johnston, and Grinter methods of design. The experiment stopped after permanent yielding occurred in the web and a kink developed in the top flange.</description><creator>Goldman, Carl.</creator><contributor>Joly, G.

The tests were carried out on lipped angles of the same cross-section but of varying length. A range of slenderness ratios from 33.6 to 178.9 was covered and lateral deflections, stresses, and rotations of the struts were measured at intervals in all cases. A comparison was drawn between the experimental results and the failure loads predicted by elastic stability theory. The results were found to be in good general agreement with the computed values for the type of section tested.</description><creator>Girolami, Renato. L.</creator><contributor>Wilson, V.

For of all the continental vastness four times-buried under the great ice sheets of the Pleistocene epoch, only one land area of any size remained ice free. That was the area of central Alaska and the western Yukon Territory. Here is to be sought the most complete climatic and stratigraphic record of Pleistocene events on the continent, north of the southern border of ice. Within this area, one is fortunate to find a road and transportation network which makes it accessible to the field worker as no other place in North America so far north.</description><creator>Gerard, Robert.
