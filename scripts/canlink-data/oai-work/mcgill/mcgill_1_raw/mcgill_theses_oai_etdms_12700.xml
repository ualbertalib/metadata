These two diets were combined to form one basal diet which was fed with supplements of raw and cooked egg at three levels in a second series of tests to humans and in a third series to rats. Higher digestion values were obtained for cooked egg than for raw egg with both species. Rats digested all fractions of the basal diet but ether extract to a lesser extent than did humans. Physiological fuel values calculated from the data were compared with those of Atwater. The applicability of the latter to individual foods and to different species was questioned.

The frequency of resonance has been compared with that of the proton in the same magnetic field.

With the advent of these higher frequencies, other problems arose which were not encountered at lower orders of frequency. For instance, it became increasingly more difficult to contain power on transmission lines without encountering high losses at short wave lengths. Power radiating from an antenna was highly desired, but power, radiating from the transmission line which was feeding the antenna, was another question.</description><creator>Hoy, Norman Adams</creator><contributor>Chipman, R.

Among these adjuncts, which have been adequately tested, are curare and myanesin. They relax the muscles of the body to a degree depending on the dosage, the nature of the anaesthetic gases and the general physical condition of the patient. Benzimidazole also belongs to this group of substances which cause muscular relaxation. Curare was first introduced as a muscle relaxant in anaesthesia by Griffith and Johnson of Montreal in 1942.

It is underlain by a conformable series of precambrian quartzite, limestone, and slate members. One limb of the major anticline is disturbed locally by a zone of minor folding. This minor folding has caused considerable plastic flowage in a thick limestone member of the series. As a result of the flowage, the limestone beds are intricately folded and have developed a distinctive layered structure. The origin of this layering by metamorphic differentiation is discussed. A series of quartz veins, containing small amounts of gold, occurs along the crest of the major anticline principally within the uppermost quartzite member. These appear to have been deposited from solutions which invaded fissures formed as a result of the folding.</description><creator>Henderson, Gerald Gordon Lewis</creator><contributor>Wilson, V.

The total field then present is the superposition of the two component fields, the source field and the one arising from the induced distribution over the body. The magnitude of this induced field in any direction is dependent on the composition, the size relative to the wavelength of the incident radiation and on the shape of the body. In recent years the problem of determining the magnitude of the induced field has received considerable impetus due to the advent of Radar.</description><creator>Griffiths, Herbert David</creator><contributor>Woonton, G.

Stoll (1947) has estimated that at least eight hundred million human beings are infested with more than two billion helminths. There are also thousands of species of parasites which do not infest man, but which have as their natural hosts other animals, or plants. Despite the extensive distribution of parasitic worms and their enormous economic and medical importance, little is known concerning their life processes.</description><creator>Glocklin, Vera C.</creator><contributor>Fairbairn, D.

The object of this study was to determine whether or not botulinum toxin inhibits the bacterial acetylation of choline. No effect upon the synthesis or release of acetylcholine by Lactobacillus plantarum was demonstrated. It may be that the large toxin molecule is unable to penetrate the cell membrane. The apparent activity of a bacterial cell-free "extract" of the enzyme involved in the acetylation of choline indicates however the advisability of further work.</description><creator>Girvin, Grace T.</creator><contributor>Burgen, A.

While there numerous cases of infectious mononucleosis were studied, and the Paul-Bunnell reaction was seen as a valuable tool in the differential diagnosis of this disease, especially where the blood picture suggested that of lymphatic leucemia. It was our experience, however, that roughly one serum out of ten from cases diagnosed on a clinical basis as infectious mononucleosis and exhibiting the typical mononuclear blood picture seen in this disease, failed at any time during the course of infection to give a significant Paul-Bunnell test.</description><creator>Girard, Kenneth F.</creator><contributor>Murray, E.

This will explain why certain subjects have not been dealt with in the following pages and why the bibliography does not list some material which would certainly have to be consulted in a general study of the introduction of machinery during the Industrial Revolution. This thesis deals with the period 1760-1810. In the greater work, the thesis presented here will be preceded with a discussion of machinery introduced in England before the Industrial Revolution, and followed with discussions on the Luddite disturbances, the introduction of agricultural machinery and of the power loom, and the impact of machinery on politics, on early socialist thought and on economic theory.</description><creator>Gardner, Charles Whiting</creator><contributor>Usher, A.

The extension is an elaboration of existing contour analysis and not an application of that analysis to new fields. The object is to carry the analysis of indifference curves and isoquants to a logical conclusion. This entails a detailed consideration of areas of the contour maps not required for ordinary discussions of demand and production problems. Three preliminary arguments may be advanced for extending the analysis.</description><creator>Galbraith, J. A.</creator><contributor>Weldon, J.

Many of the possible roads of investigation have been blocked waiting for progress in special fields. However, much investigation can be done using the present knowledge to help elucidate the extremely difficult but important problems. Any advancement in the knowledge of gastric secretion would be a valuable step forward in the understanding of this complex function and might be used to great value in many important problems including that of peptic ulcer and combined systems disease.</description><creator>Forse, Raymond F.</creator><contributor>Miller, G.
