Five organs built by four of the most important organ builders of early eighteenth-century Middle Germany (Tobias Heinrich Gottfried Trost, Gottfried Silbermann, Zacharias Hildebrandt, and Joachim Wagner) are discussed in the context of their mixtures, and whether or not they contain a  major-third-sounding rank. The presence of a major-third-sounding rank in an organ creates a unique sound, and one that was familiar to J.S. Bach. As such, this unique sound is considered in the context of the organ works of Bach. This paper is divided into four chapters. The first includes an Introduction and Overview of the research problem and the mixtures of the five historic organs that were the subjects of the research. Chapter II discusses important issues to consider in the context of the major-third mixture: temperament of the instrument; and the texture, key, and mode of the composition being performed. Chapter III applies the research to performance practice. A detailed  discussion of  a recent performance on a twentieth-century North American organ is presented in the context of the major-third mixture. The topics of the second chapter are applied in the third, and further reflections of the practical application of the research are given.

Nesting habits, modes of progression, skeleton, and muscles have been examined in turn without arriving at a final settlement of the question. There are more species of birds than of mammals, but fewer definable orders. Birds as a whole present a degree of adaptive radiation such as is to be found in a single order of reptiles or of mammals, and this is expressed anatomically in the presence or absence, atrophy or hypertrophy of parts. The information on these matters is scattered and in some instances confused, and practically no anatomical research has been devoted to local Canadian birds.

A summary is given of the ev1denoe for the presence in lignin of those chemical groupings which, if present, would be capable of reacting with sulphurous acid. The results obtained by studying the electrical conductivity over the temperature range 180 - 146 degrees C. of reaction mixtures of sulphurous acid and a large number of type oompounds is discussed together with data on the stability of the resultant sulphonic acids and the mobility of the equilibrium involved. The compounds investigated include saturated and unsaturated aldehydes, saturated and unsaturated ketones, cycllc ketones and phenols, substances in wh1ah an ethylene linkage is the only reactive group, furane derivatives and compounds containing pyrone rings. The study is then extended to theligno sulphonio acids and important deductions are made as to the mechanism of formation of these acids and their constitution. The results are further discussed as applied tothe process of sulphite pulp manufacture.

The thesis is "There are types of religious organization which are peculiar to frontier environments". With this in mind, early frontiers of the United States were studied and the types of religious activity found therein. Then followed a comparison of frontier life of today with this early pattern, and it was found that the religious pattern of the modern frontier differs in many respects from the pattern of tke early frontier. Then the specific frontier of the study - namely, the Peace River - was subjected to a detailed study, in order to show the likenesses or differences to tke general pattern that had already been presented. The factors tkat influenced the growth and pattern of settlement of the area were dealt with in detail, thus showine the ecology of the area. With the ecological distribution presented, the next step was to trace the process of social interaction, in relation to the social organization or the area, particu1arly the re1igious phase of this organization.

If the liquid is in an open vessel exposed to the atmosphere, ebullition will set in when the vapor pressure has reached a value of one atmosphere. However if the liquid be entirely enclosed and then heated above its normal boiling point no bubbles will result, but evaporation will take place silently and inconspicuously with the result that the amount in the vapor phase will increase with a rise in temperature. Finally a remarkable occurrence takes place. The meniscus dividing the two phases disappears and no longer can any distinction be made between vapor and liquid.

The action of both these organisms is apparently specific in that they only bring about polysaccharide formation from sugars containing a terminal fructofuranose residue in their molecule. A similar synthesis can be carried out by employing the corresponding enzyme-preparation from Bacillus mesentericus. The bearing of these results on the known fact that yeast invertase only exerts its hydrolytic action on sugars containing a terminal fructofuranose group is discussed in detail.

The term spruce saw-fly as applied to the species is not a satisfactory one, it having been previously applied to another speoies, Diprion (Lophyrus) abietis, of the same family (Swaine '13 and 115).
