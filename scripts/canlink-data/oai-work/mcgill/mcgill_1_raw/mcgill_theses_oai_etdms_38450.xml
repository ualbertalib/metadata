The legal control of the use of NPS results from international space conventions and, since 1992, from the Principles Relevant to the Use of NPS and established preventive and emergency measures, and a liability and compensation regime. Several areas call for improvement to increase efficiency and comprehensiveness of the control. Proposals for revision encompass reinforcing the 1992 Principles (scope, applicability, binding force etc.). Other proposals want to integrate to the existing regime the principles elaborated for terrestrial applications of nuclear energy. It is also broadly recognized that an efficient control must take into consideration the space debris issue. Modalities of the revisions proposed as well as their potential framework vary as opinions differ as to the extend of the revision to be conducted.</description><creator>Rossi y Costa, Béatrice.</creator><contributor>Milde, Michael (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</subject><subject>Energy.</subject><title>Legal control of the use of nuclear power sources in outer space : elements for a revision</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nk322g25h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tb09j738w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4b29b7993</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:50:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Mediation---a private and informal dispute resolution process, attended by the immediate disputants and facilitated by an impartial and neutral third person without power to impose a decision---is analyzed for its compatibility with the rationales and its effects on the functions of employment law. The process is found to be conceptually compatible with a theoretical perspective on employment law that focuses on efficiency, but inconsistent with the perspectives that emphasize the importance of individual rights in employment or the social balance of diverging interests. In practice, mediation fosters efficiency, but is not capable of ensuring individual rights and improving social justice. Consequentially, mediation is suitable for the resolution of disputes under contractual employment law, but---without procedural safeguards---not suited to resolve disputes governed by employment regulations. Where disputes are governed by both contractual and regulatory elements, mediation's suitability depends on the relative importance of the different elements.</description><creator>Steiner, Jochen.</creator><contributor>Brierley, John E.

In part 1, this thesis uses the example of Frankfurt Airport to introduce to the phenomenon of airport congestion and argues that states are under a legal obligation to prevent a situation in which airports can no longer keep pace with the rapid growth of civil air transport. In part 2, possible remedies to airport congestion at FRA are identified and discussed in depth. Part 3 concludes with the argument that the expansion of the runway system at Frankfurt Airport will prove inevitable. However, since the expansion capabilities of airports are generally limited, it is further argued that airport access will remain as a scarce resource in the future. As a result, dealing with airport congestion should not be understood as synonymous with airport expansion. Instead, all available options should be identified and employed so that airport access can be allocated on a more reflective basis, taking into account measures which will prevent or at least minimize congestion in the future.</description><creator>Slenczka, Johannes.</creator><contributor>Milde, Michael (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Law.</subject><subject>Transportation.</subject><title>Airport congestion at Frankfurt and the law</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/st74cs371.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rr172017v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wp988n01w</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:50:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The 1980 and 1993 Hague Conventions focused on two very important issues concerning children: illegal kidnapping and international adoption. The Conventions' drafters, faced with the opposing realities of globalisation and balkanisation in today's world, applied concepts of international cooperation to deter abuses against children. The Conventions' articles are original in the methods they employ to coordinate private international law systems. They encourage and permit international cooperation. Their real impact, however, lies in the legal flexibility they generate. Indeed, the Conventions' goals are notably achieved through the creation and application of informal law. Much pertinent literature has already been written on the specific technical mechanisms of the Conventions. I have taken a more wide-ranging approach in order to underline the weaker points in the Conventions' implementation, while also noting those that have strong potential for the future.</description><creator>Saris, Anne.</creator><date>1998</date><subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</subject><subject>Law.</subject><title>L'originalité des mécanismes de protection de l'enfant dans les Conventions de La Haye de 1980 et 1993</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2z10ws23n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wp988n01w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x920fz59g</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:50:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Plusieurs mouvements islamistes armes ont donne les signes d'importants changements sur le plan du comportement et de l'ideologie en faveur de la nonviolence. Les processus de de-radicalisation de ces mouvements ont conduit au retrait de dizaines de milliers d'anciens militants des rangs des supporteurs d' Al Qaida et ont eu un effet dissuasif sur ceux qui songeaient a se joindre a eux. Ces processus ont eu lieu a grande echelle en Egypte et en Algerie et a plus petite echelle en Libye, en Arabie Saoudite, au Yemen, en Jordanie, au Tadjikistan, en Malaisie et en Indonesie. Cette these porte sur des lacunes importantes dans la litterature sur l'islamisme, les etudes de securite et le contreterrorisme. Elle cherche a savoir pourquoi les militants radicaux islamistes ont revise leurs ideologies, leurs strategies et leur objectifs et initie un processus de de-radicalisation. Cette these vise arepondre a ces questions afin de comprendre les conditions necessaires a la reussite d'un tel processus. Au cours des chapitres suivants, j'analyse comment des facteurs tels que les politiques etatiques, le leadership charismatique, et les interactions sociales entre les couches d'une organisation islamiste ainsi qu'entre la meme organisation et l' « Autre» peuvent tous interagir pour modifier les perspectives d'un mouvement islamiste de fayon aI'amener arenoncer ala violence, tant dans son comportement que dans son ideologie.

The "de-radicalization" processes of these movements removed tens of thousands of former militants from the ranks of al-Qa'ida's supporter and acted as disincentives for would-be militants. These processes have taken place on a large scale in Egypt and Algeria, and on a smaller scale in Libya, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Jordan, Tajikistan, Malaysia and Indonesia. This dissertation addresses crucial lacunae in the literature on Islamism, security and counterterrorism studies by asking the question 'why do radical Islamist militants revise their ideologies, strategies and objectives and initiate a de-radicalization process.' The dissertation also aims to answer the question of what are the necessary conditions under which this process can be successful. In the following chapters, I analyze how such factors as state policies, charismatic leadership and social interaction between the layers of an Islamist organization, as well as between the same organization and the "other," can all interact to shape the prospects for renunciation violence, both behaviourally and ideologically, by an Islamist movement. Empirically, I analyze the deradicalization processes of three cases in Egypt (the armed wings of the Muslim Brothers, the Islamic Group and al-Jihad Organization) and one case in Algeria (Islamic  Salvation Army and affiliated militias). I also analyze two cases of deradicalization failure in Algeria, as a means to further explicate and examine my variables. The arguments in the dissertation are based on qualitative comparative research. Archival interviews, supplemented by personal ones, with Islamist leaders, mid-ranking commanders, grassroots organization members, Islamist movements' specialists, former security and intelligence officers and state officials are analyzed to help identify the potential causes of de-radicalization from different perspectives. Content analysis is also used to examine original literature and statements produced by the Islamist groups under study and their leaders to both legitimize and, at a later stage, to de-legitimize violence. In the conclusion, the dissertation provides a comprehensive theoretical framework that explains the causes of de-radicalization of armed Islamist movements. It also provides direction for future research agendas and addresses policy implications relevant to de-radicalization.</description><creator>Ashour, Omar</creator><contributor>Rex Brynen (supervisor)</contributor><date>2008</date><subject>Terrorism -- Religious aspects -- Islam.</subject><subject>Radicalism -- Religious aspects -- Islam.</subject><subject>Islam and politics.</subject><subject>Jihad.</subject><subject>Islamic fundamentalism.</subject><title>A world without Jihad? : the causes of de-radicalization of armed Islamist movements</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f1881n90q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x920fz59g</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4m90dx30p</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:50:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Using a two-dimensional nonlinear numerical simulation of a (viscous) stratified shear layer, strong instabilities resulted from the resonant interaction of a long linearly neutrally stable wave and the corresponding fastest growing wave. This linearly fastest growing wave, with optimal initial conditions, grows initially at a rate five times that predicted by linear theory. With other initial conditions, the linearly fastest growing wave may actually decay. The possibility of this type of interaction is suggested by the weakly nonlinear theory (cf. Maslowe, 1977). This coupled system of fourth order nonl inear partial differential equations was solved using a modified pseudospectral scheme for the spatial variables, incorporating the use of fast Fourier transforms to calculate spatial derivatives, and a second order Adams-Bashforth scheme for the temporal derivatives .</description><description>Dans cette etude, en utilisant une simulation numerique nonlineaire a deux dimensions d'une couche stratifiee, decollee et visqueuse, on obtint des resultats interessants a partir des cas correspondant a l'interaction resonnante d'une onde longue a stabilite neutre et d'une onde courte qui croit la plus rapidement selon la theorie lineaire.

For all the pulps tested these characteristics of dimensional stability were found to be improved by high temperature superheated steam drying. The hygroexpansion coefficient, the dimensional change relative to paper moisture content, was reduced about 15% by superheated steam drying at 320°C, compared to paper dried in low temperature air. Irreversible shrinkage was reduced by up to 30% for sheets dried in superheated steam. However, these effects on hygroexpansivity were caused mainly by the high drying temperature and the resulting high drying rate regardless of the drying fluid. Drying shrinkage and wet expansion as well were reduced by about 10% and 15% respectively for paper dried in superheated steam. In superheated steam drying the elevated web temperature at the start of drying is believed to affect paper properties through thermal softening of the lignin and relaxation of drying and wet-pressing stresses. Increased fiber bonding with softened lignin accounts for both the increased elastic modulus and decreased light scattering coefficient observed. These were obtained only for sheets from mechanical pulps with initial moisture content of about 0.4 kg-water/kg-fiber or more, consistent with the mechanism of thermal softening of plasticized lignin. High sheet temperature in the falling rate period improves hygroscopicity of paper through reducing its equilibrium moisture content. Superheated steam drying improves the dimensional stability of paper from such pulps, including less anisotropy, thereby enhancing paper quality.</description><creator>Nanri, Yasunori.</creator><contributor>Douglas, W.

Specifically, two new spreading code families of 2-dimensional (2D) wavelength-time system are considered: Depth-First Search Codes (DFSC) and Balanced Codes for Differential Detection (BCDD). DFSC utilizes a depth-first search algorithm to generate unipodal codes with maximum unit auto- and cross-correlation properties that are suitable for direct detection. These codes have similar interference-limited bit error rate (BER) performance as most 2D wavelength-time codes, but the algorithm can generate more codes, enabling the full potential of Forward Error Correction (FEC). BCDD defines a new set of high weight antipodal codes with relaxed correlation constraints that is suitable for differential detection. These codes can support approximately twice as many users as the other previously published OCDMA systems. Using a system with 32 wavelengths and 16 time chips operating at OC-12 transmission rates (622Mbps), BCDD can support an aggregate throughput of approximately 136Gbps when proper FEC is applied. Furthermore, studies on the information theoretical capacity of chip synchronous OCDMA channel with Single User Detection (SUD) is conducted to obtain the ultimate throughput that can be achieved. Calculations are done under three assumptions: (i) interference-limited channel, (ii) interference-limited channel with Gaussian noise; or (iii) Gaussian approximated interference channel. In additions, system specific DFSC and BCDD capacity is obtained. These results are used as the basis for comparison among DFSC, BCDD and other previously proposed OCDMA systems. It is found that the maximum throughput of an OCDMA system is limited to about 0.7 bits per OCDMA chip. With the application of turbo code, BCDD can support an aggregate throughput of about 0.42 bits per OCDMA chip.</description><creator>Yim, Raymond, 1978-</creator><contributor>Chen, Lawrence (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Bajcsy, Jan (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>New approaches to optical code-division multiple access</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d217qr518.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vd66w1633</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:br86b524v</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:50:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Nyquist rate analog to digital converter have always been an essential component in complex systems ranging from digital oscilloscope, radar, to modern telecommunication equipments. The fast-paced development in these complex systems has necessitated methods to improve resolution and power consumption of the analog to digital converters. The aim of this thesis is to offer one such method. The method involves the application of a digital DC reference source. The digital reference source will be proposed and used to remove mismatch, reduce comparator offset, thus improving the resolution of both flash and pipeline ADCs, while consuming no static power. The design of pipeline ADCs is also the emphasis of this work. The digital reference source consists of flip-flops and RC low-pass filters. By programming flip-flops with appropriate digital bit streams, accurate DC reference levels can be generated. The generated DC reference levels replace the need for reference ladder in Flash ADCs. Furthermore, with programmability provided by the digital reference source, the generated reference levels can be modified to reduce comparator offset. The comparator offset reduction algorithm is also applied to pipeline ADCs to reduce non-linear distortion. The design details of pipeline ADC is also discussed in this work. Quantitative analyses have been provided in determining design parameters in various subsystems. The analyses ensure that a 10-bit resolution is achieved for the pipeline ADC. Both Flash ADC and pipeline ADC were implemented in a 0.25 mum and 0.18 mum CMOS process respectively, and results demonstrating their successful operation are presented.</description><creator>Wu, Yang, 1974-</creator><contributor>Roberts, Gordon W.

A full numerical model is used to simulate and fully characterize the performance and properties of single-stage and two-stage EDFAs. We focus on two configurations of two-stage L-band EDFAs with gain-clamped characteristics using partial gain-clamping. Partial gain-clamping is obtained by forming a fiber grating laser in either the first or the second stage of the two-stage EDFA. From our simulation and experimental results, we conclude the following: (1) a good gain-clamping effect can be achieved by partially gain-clamped configurations in which only one stage (first or second) is truly clamped; (2) an inherent low noise figure can also be obtained when the second stage is clamped; (3) the selection of feedback wavelengths and feedback levels are critical for obtaining a flat gain spectrum and low noise performance; (4) small transient gain (power) excursions can be realized with partially clamped configurations and relaxation oscillations are well suppressed when a high feedback level is used without large degradation in either the gain or noise figure.</description><creator>Xia, Bing, 1972-</creator><contributor>Chen, Lawrence (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Theoretical and experimental analyses of all-optical gain-clamped L-band EDFAs</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fx719p15g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2f75r9664</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8049g6929</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:50:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A new, efficient image compression algorithm based on a rotating, overlapping, hierarchical representation (ROHR) is presented. This algorithm first decomposes the spatial image data into a hierarchical coordinate space, composed of interconnected nodes. The surprise of each node represents the entropy of the corresponding image area, and determines its significance in reconstructing the image. Surprises are ordered and transmitted in decreasing order of magnitude with a bucket encoding method, yielding an embedded code. ROHR allows for either lossless compression, or for termination of the encoding or decoding at any point to meet a target compression ratio or distortion metric. In the latter; image reconstruction from the transmitted data occurs without the introduction of artifacts that would indicate where the truncation occurred. Moreover, the procedures allow for real-time video encoding or decoding operations on color images of 256 x 192 pixels on current PC architectures, considerably faster than equivalent software JPEG codecs.</description><creator>Zhang, Yuan, 1976-</creator><contributor>Cooperstock, Jeremy R.

Time and frequency domain characterization of jitter is thus a crucial element for system specification testing. Time domain jitter measurement on a data signal with sub-gate timing resolution can be achieved using two delay chains feeding into the clock and data lines of a series of D-latches known as a Vernier Delay Line (VDL). An important drawback to the VDL structure is that its measurement accuracy depends on the matching of the various delay elements. Although careful layout techniques can help to minimize these mismatches, it cannot eliminate them completely. As well, due to the nature of the design, a relatively large silicon area is required for silicon implementation. In this work, a novel technique is developed which reduces the silicon area requirements by two orders of magnitude, as well enables the measurement device to be synthesized from a register transfer level (RTL) description. A custom IC was designed and fabricated in a 0.18 mum CMOS process as a first proof of concept. The design requires a silicon area of 0.12 mm2 and measured results indicate a timing resolution of 19 ps. The synthesizable nature of the design is demonstrated using a FPGA implementation. In addition, another custom IC was designed and fabricated in a 0.35 mum CMOS process as a frequency characterization circuit to process and extract information from the data obtained from the VDL. This design occupies a silicon area of 1.83 mm2. As test time is an important consideration for a production test, an extension to this component-invariant VDL technique is provided that reduces test time at the expense of more hardware. Finally, a method for obtaining the frequency domain characteristics of the jitter using the VDL will also be given.</description><creator>Chan, Antonio</creator><contributor>Roberts, Gordon W.

Most existing multiuser communication systems still perform far below their theoretical limits, partly because the implementation of optimal multiuser receivers has exponential complexity. This thesis studies aspects of transmission over the multi-access (MAC) channel in case of K equal power users. It is motivated by wireless communication systems with perfect power control and optical transmission in local area networks. Limits on CDMA transmission are obtained using multi-access channel models and capacity calculations. Using these insights, a technique is proposed to increase throughput over MAC channels by exploiting controlled amount of user asynchronism. Consequently, a trellis based multiuser detector is proposed as a means to exploit the MAC channel capacity. Simulation results indicate that the proposed iterative detector has polynomial implementation complexity; achieves close to optimal performance in uncoded CDMA environments with strong interference, and outperforms the upper-bound of perfectly synchronized and noiseless BPSK based TDMA.</description><creator>Beainy, Charif</creator><contributor>Bajcsy, Jan (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>On modeling and interference cancellation in some multi-access channels</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9593tx06c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kw52j983j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8049g693k</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:50:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Sophisticated audio coding paradigms incorporate human perceptual effects in order to reduce data rates, while maintaining high fidelity of the reconstructed signal. Auditory masking is the phenomenon that is the key to exploiting perceptual redundancy in audio signals. Most auditory models conservatively estimate masking, as they were developed for medium to high rate coders where distortion can be made inaudible. At very low coding rates, more accurate auditory models will be beneficial since some audible distortion is inevitable. This thesis focuses on the application of human perception to low-rate audio coding. A novel auditory model that estimates masking levels is proposed. The new model is based on a study of existing perceptual literature. Among other features, it represents transient masking effects by tracking the temporal evolution of masking components. Moreover, an innovative bit allocation algorithm is developed that considers the excitation of quantization noise in the allocation process. The new adaptive allocation scheme is applicable with any auditory model that is based on the excitation pattern model of masking.</description><creator>Cave, Christopher R.</creator><contributor>Kabal, Peter (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Perceptual modelling for low-rate audio coding</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b8515q31r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8049g693k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h702q816f</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:50:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis details the use of a programmable logic device to increase the playing strength of a chess program. The time-consuming task of generating chess moves is relegated to hardware in order to increase the processing speed of the search algorithm. A simpler inter-square connection protocol reduces the number of wires between chess squares, when compared to the DEEP BLUE design. With this interconnection scheme, special chess moves are easily resolved. Furthermore, dynamically programmable arbiters are introduced for optimal move ordering. Arbiter centrality is also shown to improve move ordering, thereby creating smaller search trees. The move generator is designed to allow the integration of crucial move ordering heuristics. With its new hardware move generator, the chess program's playing ability is noticeably improved.</description><creator>Boulé, Marc</creator><contributor>Zilic, Zeljko (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>An FPGA move generator for the game of chess /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c247dv004.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h702q816f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gt54kq07d</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:50:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In recent decades the ongoing rise of refugee populations around the world has provided a unique opportunity to study the impact of forced migrations on the identities of individuals and collectivities. The simultaneous emergence of the novel social phenomenon of 'refugee societies' has captured anthropological interest in the way in which 'refugee identity' is currently imagined and represented. A useful entry point for exploring representations of 'refugee' identity within a new culture of refugees is found in the recurrent notion of suffering. 'Suffering' is conceptualized here as an ideological grammar that characterizes a variety of language games contained in a broader 'language of suffering'. Focus is directed towards the 'medical dialect of suffering' and its role in articulating the identities of refugees and representing their experiences of suffering. Medical discourse, practices, and technologies can drive the transformation of the categorical 'refugee' identity into a 'medicalized' and 'traumatized' identity: revealing how medicine not only reflects cultural meanings of suffering, but can also project new cultural meanings of suffering. The relevant case of Afghan refugees illustrates how cultural identities can be conceptualized as shifting, strategic, and multiplicitous---realities that can be a blend of both coherency and contradiction.</description><creator>Khan, Yasir</creator><contributor>Young, Allan (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Refugees -- Afghanistan.</subject><subject>Refugees -- Mental health -- Afghanistan.</subject><subject>Group identity -- Afghanistan.</subject><title>A calculus of new refugee culture : identity, Afghans, and the medical dialect of suffering</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7h149r56w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gt54kq07d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Social Studies of Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p2676x59q</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:50:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis attempts to develop our understanding of the ultimate interprovincial rupture at the signing of the Social Union Framework Agreement (the SUFA) on February 4, 1999. Questioning the widely accepted "money talk" explanation, which argues that increased federal transfers motivated the ROC provinces to go along with the federal government at the expense of an interprovincial common front with Quebec, this thesis suggests analyzing the dynamics of the SUFA negotiation process with special attention to the visions of Canadian federalism to which the ROC provinces, Quebec, and the federal government had subscribed respectively. This analysis demonstrates that the final split between the ROC provinces and Quebec resulted from their discord over the question whether or not Canada is a mononational federation or a multinational federation.</description><creator>Koji, Junichiro</creator><contributor>Gagnon, Alain-G.

In the past twenty years however, a space has been created for it in the public consciousness. The object of this study is to trace the shifts that have occurred in how FGM has been talked about and make the ongoing dialogue visible. This is achieved by examining feminist debates, human rights discourse and the media as not only primary definers of the issue but also as sites of discourse production. In moving from the local to global agenda, more actors have become involved in the debates and as such have further complexified an already complex practice. Each site offers a unique perspective and representation on the FGM controversy and has contributed to how the West has made meaning of the practice.</description><creator>Kanywani, Maroushka F.</creator><contributor>Hamilton, Sheryl (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Female circumcision</subject><subject>Feminism</subject><subject>Human rights</subject><title>Talking taboo : representations of female genital mutilation (FGM) in feminist debates, human rights discourse &amp; the media</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vd66w165n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cf95jd19v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7p88cj52h</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:50:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study is a comparative analysis of the marginalizarion of the Baha'is in Iran and the Ahmadis in Pakistan over the last forty years.

Our survey instrument aimed at knowing these cultural representations and at identifying different factors likely to influence the development of these representations according to the French level in which students are registered, either beginner or intermediate and advanced. Our hypothesis is that students registered in the intermediate and advanced levels hold more positive cultural representations than beginners, therefore that there exists a significant difference between participants from both groups. In order to verify this hypothesis, a questionnaire, based on procedural knowledge and the affective domain, has been administered to 449 students from four different cegeps. The analysis of data linked to procedural knowledge demonstrates that there is indeed a significant difference between both groups with regards to the different factors that are likely to influence the development of cultural representations, with the exception of the travelling frequency of members of the participants' family. Furthermore, our analysis for the affective domain partly confirmed that students enrolled in intermediate and advanced courses in French generally hold more positive cultural representations towards the French language and Quebecers whose language of use is French than beginners.</description><creator>Amireault, Valerie.</creator><contributor>Lussier, Denise (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Language and culture -- Québec (Province)</subject><subject>College students -- Québec (Province) -- Attitudes.</subject><subject>French language -- Study and teaching -- Québec (Province)</subject><subject>French language -- Study and teaching -- Foreign speakers.</subject><title>Etude comparative des representations culturelles des etudiants de niveaux debutant, intermediaire et avance des colleges anglophones publics de Montreal envers la langue francaise et les Quebecois dont la langue d'usage est le francais</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z316q3434.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/df65v968f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Integrated Studies in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:np193b86j</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:50:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Rationale. Potent serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors are the only drugs that consistently exert a therapeutic action in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Given that some hallucinogens were reported to exert a persistent anti OCD effect outlasting their psychotomimetic action, possible modifications of neuronal responsiveness to 5-HT by LSD were examined in two rat brain structures: one associated with OCD, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and another linked to depression, the hippocampus. Methods . The effects of concurrent microiontophoretic application of LSD and 5-HT were examined on neuronal firing rate in the rat OFC and hippocampus under chloral hydrate anesthesia. In order to determine whether LSD could also exert any modification of 5-HT neuronal responsiveness upon systemic administration, after a delay when hallucinosis is presumably no longer present, it was given once daily (100 mug/kg, i.p.) for four days and the experiments were carried out 24 hours after the last dose. Results. LSD attenuated the firing activity of OFC neurons, but enhanced the inhibitory effect of 5-HT when concomitantly ejected on the same neurons. In the hippocampus, LSD also decreased firing rate by itself but decreased the inhibitory action of 5-HT. The inhibitory action of 5-HT was significantly greater in the OFC, but smaller in the hippocampus, when examined after subacute systemic administration of LSD. Conclusions. It is postulated that some hallucinogens could have a beneficial action in OCD by enhancing 5-HT receptor responsiveness in the OFC, and not necessarily in direct relation to hallucinosis. The latter observation may have theoretical implications for the pharmacotherapy of OCD.</description><creator>Zghoul, Tarek</creator><contributor>Blier, P.

By using odor-fasting duration conditioning, two studies were conducted to test the above hypothesis. In the first study, thirteen male and eleven female adult Wistar rats were given 1.5 hours to ingest a casein-based test-meal odorized by either vanilla or chicken flavor prior to a 4-hour short-fast or a 12-hour long-fast. Rats went through the training phase with a pseudo-random sequence of six duplicates of each odor-fasting pairing over four experimental days, followed by an odor preference test. Gender differences may exist regarding hunger perception because only females were capable of adjusting meal size according to the postprandial fast duration. A second study was conducted to examine whether a sugar-rich meal can improve acquisition of anticipatory satiety through memory enhancement. Thirty-two female Sprague-Dawley rats were given either a sugar-rich or a protein-rich test-meal prior to the post-prandial fasts. Rats were conditioned in a similar fashion to the first study except that different odors were used, postprandial fasts were shortened to 3 and 10 hours, whereas training phase was elongated to eleven duplicates and followed by an extinction phase. Both dietary groups acquired the anticipatory satiety. However, probably due to the carbohydrate-induced overeating, the sugar-rich group in contrast to the protein-rich group, exhibited a delayed learning in meal-size adjustment prior to a short fast. The above studies demonstrated the existence of gender and macronutrient differences in food intake regulation.</description><creator>Yiin, Yeh-Min, 1975-</creator><contributor>Thibault, Louise (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Food -- Odor.</subject><subject>Appetite.</subject><subject>Rats -- Food.</subject><subject>Food preferences.</subject><subject>Hunger.</subject><title>Acquisition of odor-cued fasting-anticipatory satiety in rats</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1c18dh650.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hx11xg77s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wp988n03f</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:50:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Azobenzenes can undergo photoisomerization, therefore systems incorporating these chromophores present light-switchable properties. The reversible photoisomerization from the trans to the cis form is accompanied by several changes at the molecular level. Differences in the absorption spectrum, polarity and structure between the two isomers have been used in various systems to fine-tune other properties of these systems with light. The present work reviews physical properties that can be photomodulated in polymers functionalised with azobenzenes. Emphasis is put on electric and magnetic properties, structural changes, surface properties, binding activity, complexation, stereochemistry, ion permeability and enzyme activity. The second part of the thesis details experimental investigations about the photoresponsive behaviour of thin films of polyelectrolytes containing azobenzenes. Namely, poly(allyl amine hydrochloride) was self-assembled with a synthetic random copolymer of acrylic acid and disperse red 1.

CLASS simulations with and without the new organic soil parameterisation developed for peatland conditions were compared with three summer months of measurements at each site. The sites are located in a cryoturbated region and are underlain by continuous permafrost and feature mineral soil hummocks and organic soil inter-hummock zones. Results from the peatland version of CLASS showed significant improvement over the standard version although in both cases, there was an underestimation of latent heat fluxes and overestimation of sensible heat fluxes. The observed soil moisture contents are almost constant at both sites. Field photographs show the sites are located in low-lying areas, one in a local depression and the other at the bottom of a valley. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the constant soil moisture content is maintained by lateral flow from adjacent hillslopes. This assumption could be further supported by the influence of mineral earth hummocks in TVC drainage basin. CLASS is a one-dimensional column model and it is not possible to explicitly represent lateral flow. Thus a nudging module is added to the peatland version of CLASS to reflect this horizontal water movement. Simulations were further improved with this modification. This additional module is a simple and effective way to represent the effect of lateral flow.</description><creator>Rodgers, David G.</creator><contributor>Lin, Charles A.
