Much has been written about this problem and many plans have been devised to attack it, but seldom, if ever, have studies been made on housing situations as unique as that which faces Hong Kong to-day. Hong Kong’s “problem of people” is well known; seen from another angle it is also a “problem of land”.

However, the life of birdsfoot trefoil has been only two or three years in Quebec, instead of at least ten which is expected in the southeastern area of the United States (Drake 1958). The reduction in the life span of this plant in Quebec is generally attributed to "winter killing," but the cause of winter killing could be due to a number of factors such as: frost; Sclerotinia trifoliorum Erikss.

The problem is then stated -- what is the relation between mysticism and Hebrew prophetism? Can the latter be described as mystical, or is the Hebrew mind alien to mysticism? We then look at the Hebrew religion as it makes contact with Baalistic prophetism, an early form of mysticism. In the struggle that ensued between the two, we discover the religion of Israel absorbing something from Baalism but asserting its own peculiar genius. Some of the great prophetical books are then examined. The conclusion we reach is that, although there are mystical elements in the prophets, mysticism and prophetism are two distinct systems, with deep differences in their conception of God’s nature, in their idea or the relationahip between God and man, and in their attitude to life and the world.</description><creator>Adamson, James.

The term ‘Property’ has a bewildering variety of uses. However, basically it is used in two senses: that of ownership or title, and also to designate the ‘res’ over which ownership is or has been exercised. This one word is used to express both the genus and the species. The relationship between the individual and the ‘res’ which is his own property is known as the rights of ownership.</description><creator>Abramovitch, Yehuda.</creator><contributor>Rosevear, A.

A. O. Committee on Calorie Conversion Factors and Food Composition Tables met in Washington, D. C. to "develop principles on which average food composition figures used by individual countries could be based." The recommendation of this committee was that further research should be carried out "on energy - yielding constituents of food and the derivation of calorie values." As part of the investigation of the physiological fuel values proposed by Atwater in 1899 and widely used since that time for determining the useful calorie value of human foods, a comparative digestibility study involving humans, sheep, swine, rats and guinea pigs was begun in the Department of Nutrition laboratory at Macdonald College in 1949.</description><creator>Young, Helen.

However, this concept of artificial maintenance of the cardio-respiratory function had been considered over a century before. In 1812 Legallois stated "If one could substitute for the heart a kind of injection of arterial blood either natural or artificially made, one would succeed easily in maintaining alive indefinitely any part of the body whatsoever." Commencing with the development of in vitro perfusion of isolated organs by physiologists such as Starling (1925), work in this field led gradually to the design of blood pumps and artificial oxygenators capable of supporting the entire circulation.</description><creator>Wright, Earle.

From the earliest days of French exploration in North America, men have been excited by the prospect of the vast waterway stretching from the Gulf far into the interior of the continent. Even the ‘Lakehead’ , the westernmost extremity of Lake Superior, did not mark the limit restricting further extension of waterborne commerce, since the earliest travellers and traders employed the canoe, the product of native ingenuity, in making their way westwards, while the portage, by-passing navigational obstructions, became a common feature attending the conduct of the trade in Canada’s first staple.</description><creator>Wilson, George.

Changes in heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and skin conductance, as well as more easily observable reactions, such as increased muscular tension and orienting responses, have been found to result from the introduction of a stimulus change. This reaction complex has been referred to as startle response (Landis &amp; Hunt, 1939), orienting response (Robinson &amp; Gantt, 1947), and reactions to novelty (Bindra, 1959). The use of such terms emphasizes the fact that these reactions are dependent not so much upon any particular value of a specific stimulus, but on stimulus change, or novelty.</description><creator>Williams, Judith.

Fortunately, the event is rare, nevertheless it is serious and embarrassing because it develops usually as an unexpected complication. It is known to follow trauma, infections and particularly surgical procedures. The incidence of gastric dilatation has decreased considerably since the introduction of methods of anaesthesia and of gastric intubation in abdominal procedures. However, it still remains a problem of unknown etiology in many of the cases studied.</description><creator>Wekselman, Reuben.</creator><contributor>Skoryna, S.

The correction is computed by integration of tile signals in a feed-back loop. The use of logarithmic and antilogarithmic devices makes it possible to apply the proper power law relationships. Corrected grey scale CAPPI records have been obtained. The signal from heavy cores is enhanced although the total area on the display remains that of the original attenuated signal. Subsequent analysis of the system, based on previous theoretical work, led to a new adjustment method. At 5.7 cm correction for rain attenuation is not recommended because the uncertainties in interpretation of radar signals are at least of the same order of magnitude as the errors due to attenuation.</description><creator>Wein, Marceli.</creator><contributor>Marshall, J.
