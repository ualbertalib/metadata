A few facts were obtained in the beginning from the vast collection of data on the binding energies of nuclei. In order to account for saturation, Heisenberg (1) and Majorana (2) introduced the idea of exchange forces, somewhat akin to the exchange forces which occur in molecular binding. These forces give rise to spin and parity dependence in the interaction. From the large ratio of the binding energy of the alpha particle to that of the deuteron, Wigner (3) deduced that the forces were short ranged and very strong within that range.</description><creator>De Souza, Patrick.

He was able to prepare nuclei from pus cells obtained from discarded surgical bandages. From this nuclear material he was able to prepare an unusual phosphorous containing compound which he named "nuclein". At that time, the only known natural source of organic phosphorous was lecithin, and so this discovery alone was sufficient to attract attention to the compound.</description><creator>De Leon, Rogelio.

Lab. &amp; Clin. Med. 52: 118(1958).), analogous studies were carried out on the dog made ascetic by constriction of the inferior vena cava above the diaphragm. Radioiodinated albumin was injected intraperitoneally and the lymphatic absorption of fluid was calculated from the appearance of the label in the circulation, the non-lymphatic flow (usually formation) from its dilution in the effusion. The resting turnover of the unanaesthetized dog was studied. The non-lymphatic flow was found to be consistently larger than the lymphatic absorption in all the experiments but one in which the dog was "maximally ascitic", that is, where the abdomen appeared by inspection to be maximally filled with fluid.</description><creator>Dawson, Arthur.

The observation that a significant increase of mean urinary aldosterone excretion occurs in groups of patients with essential hypertension, and the discovery of functional aldosterone-producing cortical adenomas associated with a progressive form of hypertension in many stimulated a renewed interest in aldosterone as a factor possibly involved in the pathogenesis of hypertensive vascular disease.</description><creator>Davignon, Jean.</creator><contributor>Genest, J.

The study is based on the examination of 20 unmarried mothers, who were known to the social service department of a large obstetrical hospital in Montreal in 1956-67. The data were obtained by the writer, with the use of a schedule during personal interviews with the unmarried mother. In this study it was shown that neither social nor psychological factors in themselves determined the plan for the baby. It was found that the plan the unmarried mother selected relationship of for her baby was determined by the interrelationship of these two factors.</description><creator>Daniels, Phyllis.

The classical method of hydrolysis has been to heat the urine in the presence of strong acid. This treatment splits the conjugates quantitatively, but causes a certain amount of destruction or alteration of the steroids which may lead to mistaken interpretation of the results. While this method may be of some use in the routine clinical determination of total 17-KS, estimation of the individual compounds demands hydrolytic procedures that cause as little artifact formation as possible.</description><creator>Cohen, Jesse.

None of the combinations gave a significant supplementary protein effect.

In an attempt to utilize the milling excess of corn bran, a high fiber low protein corn bran feed was produced on an experimental basis. ln digestibility trials with sheep the corn bran feed was found to be less digestible and yielded less useful energy than commercial corn gluten feed.

In the current study we have evaluated the effect of a Src/Abl kinase inhibitor SKI-606, on breast cancer growth, migration, invasion and metastasis. Treatment of human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 with SKI-606 caused a marked inhibition of cell proliferation, invasion and migration by inhibiting MAPK and Akt phosphorylation. For in vivo studies MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with the plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) [MDA-MB-231-GFP] were inoculated into mammary fat pad of female BALB/c nu/nu mice. Once tumor volume reached 30-50 mm3, animals were randomized and treated with vehicle alone or 150 mg/kg of SKI-606 by daily oral gavage. Experimental animals receiving SKI-606 developed tumors of significantly smaller volume (45-54%) as compared to control animals receiving vehicle alone. Analysis of lungs, liver and spleen of these animals showed a significant decrease in GFP positive tumor metastasis in animals receiving SKI-606 at a dose that was well tolerated. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical analysis of primary tumors showed that these effects were due to the ability of SKI-606 to block tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, growth factors expression and inhibition of Src mediated signalling pathways in vivo. Together the results from these studies provide compelling evidence for the use of Src inhibitors as therapeutic agents for blocking breast cancer growth and metastasis.</description><creator>Jallal, Houda.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Quinolines -- pharmacology.</subject><subject>Nitriles -- pharmacology.</subject><subject>Aniline Compounds -- pharmacology.</subject><subject>Breast Neoplasms -- drug therapy.</subject><subject>Neoplasm Metastasis.</subject><subject>Neoplasm Invasiveness.</subject><subject>src-Family Kinases -- antagonists &amp; inhibitors.</subject><subject>Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl -- antagonists &amp; inhibitors.</subject><title>A Src-Abl kinase inhibitor, SKI-606, blocks breast cancer invasion, growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6395wc21j.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m039k879x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:dj52w826k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:09:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>DNA is a remarkable material that is both an inspiration for polymer nanotechnology and a versatile building block for assembling well-defined nanostructures. To create polymeric materials that would be useful in nanotechnology, we synthesized block copolymers containing thymine and diamidopyridine side chains. These DNA-mimetic polymers self-assembled into spherical aggregates in solution, held together by hydrogen bonding interactions. We have reported the first example of a block copolymer micellar aggregate that is capable of selective recognition of small-molecule guests, with concomitant changes in its aggregation behavior. In the field of DNA-mediated materials, the ordering of gold nanoparticle (AuNP) arrays can be hindered by the lability of AuNP-DNA linkages. In the search of an indefinitely stable AuNP-DNA linkage, three dendritic thiol-terminated DNA strands were synthesized, and were bound to AuNPs. A preliminary AuNP-DNA linkage lability study showed potential in forming nonlabile AuNP-DNA linkages through the use of dendritic thiol-modified DNA.</description><creator>Ishihara, Yoshihiro.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Gold.</subject><subject>Nanoparticles.</subject><subject>Nanoelectromechanical systems.</subject><title>DNA-inspired materials for 'bottom-up' nanotechnology</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rr1721813.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dj52w826k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:000003670</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:09:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In experimental membranous nephropathy, complement C5b-9-induced glomerular epithelial cell (GEC) injury leads to breakdown of glomerular peimselectivity and proteinuria. This study addresses mechanisms that limit complement-mediated injury, focusing on Ras. Complement-mediated injury was attenuated in cultured GEC expressing a constitutively active form of Ras (V12Ras), compared with Neo (control) GEC. V12Ras GEC showed constitutive activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways, but inhibition of these pathways did not reverse the protective effect of Ras. V12Ras GEC showed smaller and rounder morphology, decreased F- to G-actin ratio, decreased activity of the Rho GTPase, Rac, and decreased Src activity. In V12Ras GEC, disruption or stabilization of the F-actin cytoskeleton reversed the protective effect of V12Ras on complement-mediated injury. Thus, the protective effect of V12Ras may be dependent on remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, the reduction of Src activity due to Ras activation may alter the equilibrium in activities of Rho GTPases, a family of proteins known regulate the actin cytoskeleton. Activation of Ras signaling is a novel pathway to consider in developing strategies for cytoprotection in complement-mediated injury.</description><creator>Huynh, Carl.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Cytoprotection -- physiology.</subject><subject>ras Proteins -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Complement Membrane Attack Complex.</subject><subject>Kidney Glomerulus -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Epithelium -- metabolism.</subject><subject>1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase -- metabolism.</subject><title>The cytoprotective role of Ras signaling in glomerular epithelial cell injury /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mk61rm843.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/000003670</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physiology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kh04dt10f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:09:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>During the past decade, there has been growing public attention and concern over consuming products containing or processed with genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Labeling of the food products derived from the use of GMOs has thereby been a contentious debate across the world. Currently, there are two systems with regard to labeling GMO-based products: mandatory versus voluntary. The purpose of this study was to survey the research on GMOs, its application in agriculture and the surrounding labeling issues. A theoretical model was developed to analyze non-GMO producers' labeling decisions under a voluntary labeling regime, aimed at providing a theoretical perspective for governments that are contemplating the adoption of a voluntary approach to regulate GMO food products. The analysis indicates that the size of labeling costs and consumers' preferences toward non-GMO products are critical factors that will impact on non-GMO producers' labeling decisions.</description><creator>Hu, Rongrong, 1970-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Genetically modified foods -- Labeling.</subject><subject>Genetically modified foods -- Labeling -- Canada.</subject><subject>Food -- Labeling -- Canada.</subject><subject>Food -- Labeling.</subject><title>Labeling of genetically modified organisms and the producer's negative labeling decision under a voluntary labeling regime</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6682x7519.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kh04dt10f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Agricultural Economics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xd07gx39x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:09:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the largest family of transmembrane receptors. The beta-arrestins, adaptor proteins involved in GPCR desensitization, may also act as scaffolds for signaling pathways such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. The MAPK family, which includes the extracellular-signal regulated kinases (ERK) 1 and 2, promotes cellular differentiation and proliferation. Herein, the activation of ERK1/2 upon stimulation of the GPCR bradykinin type 2 receptor (B2R) with bradykinin was examined. Various B2R mutants with modified C-termini were employed to examine the temporal kinetics of ERK1/2. One of these receptor mutants displayed a loss of beta-arrestin binding as well as greatly enhanced ERK1/2 activation, compared to the wild-type receptor, when a cluster of serine/threonine residues important for B2R internalization was mutated. The other receptor mutants exhibited a correlation between their affinity for beta-arrestin and the intensity of ERK1/2 activation. Data from a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line null for beta-arrestin suggested that beta-arrestin is involved in late-phase ERK1/2 activation by the B2R. These data point to the involvement of beta-arrestin in the activation of the ERK1/2 MAPKs through the B2R.</description><creator>Houri, Nadia.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1 -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Receptor, Bradykinin B2 -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases -- metabolism.</subject><title>Study of ERK12 MAP kinases activation by the bradykinin type 2 receptor : characterization of beta-arrestin scaffolding function in the temporal regulation of ERK12 activation induced by the B2R</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gt54kr66s.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xd07gx39x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n870zv237</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:09:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Objective. To evaluate organ donation (OD) policy, appropriate comparisons between different OD programs are required. The objective of this research was to investigate alternative methods of measuring national rates of OD using publicly available data and examine the implications of using each method as a measure of performance. Method. We used 7 measures to calculate deceased OD rates, based on 7 different denominators. Data were collected from OD organizations and the World Health Organization. OD rates for each measure were calculated for 10 countries for the years 2001--2004. Relative rates were calculated using Spain as the standard. Results. We found variations in relative rates across the proposed measures. Regardless of the measure used Spain excelled. Conclusion. If the purpose of the OD rate is to identify the top performer internationally, it may not matter which measure is used providing this is done with an understanding of its limitations.</description><creator>Hornby, Karen.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Tissue and Organ Procurement -- statistics &amp; numerical data.</subject><title>Measuring organ donation performance internationally : modeling the effects of available denominators for organ donation rates</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4j03d355x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n870zv237</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kd17cx904</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:09:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The aim of this study was to determine the predictors of excess weight gain among children participating in the Kahnawake Schools Diabetes Prevention Project (KSDPP).

Participants followed longitudinally were split into two groups: (1) children gaining weight at &amp;le; the median value of weight for their age, sex and height (n=86); (2) children gaining &gt; the median value (n=177). Therefore, two-thirds of the participants were gaining weight greater than the norm. Among boys only, those in the higher weight group were heavier for their age, sex and height at the start of their follow-up period.

Generally regarded as a behavior with a multitude of state and trait dependent risk factors (e.g. psychiatric disorders, substance abuse, genetics), explanations as to why certain individuals commit suicide while others do not are complex. Of interest is in studying potential trait dependent variables involved in the neurobiology of suicide, particularly at the cellular level. Knowledge of the cellular integrity may aid in explaining the observed macroscopic alterations and ultimately the behavioral correlates associated with suicidality. Therefore we set out to summarize extant knowledge of the cellular alterations occurring in the brains of major depressive and suicide individuals. Following this, we conducted our own cellular investigation in a region known to be altered in major depression and suicide, a supracallosal area of BA24a. Neuronal and glial cell densities as well as neuronal cell sizes were assessed in upper and lower cortical layers between sudden-death controls and MDD suicide subjects. Secondary analyses were also conducted to examine the effect of alcohol on depressed suicides. Analyses of cell densities and neuronal soma sizes between controls and MDD suicide subjects did not reveal any significant differences. Further analyses showed increased glial cell densities in alcoholic depressed suicides. Future studies are necessary to examine explicit changes in the cellular compositions occurring in alcoholic dependent individuals. Staining techniques aimed at targeting specific subtypes of neurons and glial cells will help determine if these cell populations do in fact have an influential role in suicide and MDD.</description><creator>Hercher, Christa.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Neurons -- cytology.</subject><subject>Depressive Disorder, Major -- pathology.</subject><subject>Cerebral Cortex -- pathology.</subject><subject>Gyrus Cinguli -- pathology.</subject><subject>Suicide.</subject><subject>Neuroglia -- cytology.</subject><title>Examining potential cellular alterations within the anterior cingulate cortex in major depression and suicide</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/41687m87q.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k930c1912</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rn301504p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:09:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The alteration at the low-sulphidation epithermal Banderas Au-Ag prospect, Guatemala, was characterized using a portable infrared mineral analyzer (PIMA) spectrometer and shown to comprise illite, buddingtonite and, on surface, kaolinite associated with gold mineralization. The Spextract python program, developed by the author, was used to measure variations in the short-wave infrared spectra (SWIR) which were then mapped as equal-area-of-influence or voronoi diagrams. Voronoi maps of the 2200 and 2350 nm absorption features, position and depth, respectively, for illite and 1560 and 2120 nm feature depths for buddingtonite indicate that illite crystallinity and ammonium alteration intensity increase towards gold mineralization. The latter observation suggests that gold transport and deposition may have been controlled by ammonia complexation. At conditions likely to have prevailed during mineralization, i.e., temperatures between 150° and 250°C, a pH between 5 and 8.5, an oxygen fugacity ( fO2 ) near the hematite-magnetite buffer, a chlorinity of 0.5 m, a total sulfur activity of 0.001 m, and a total nitrogen activity of 0.004 m, AuNH3 +2 is the dominant ammonia complex and gold solubility at optimal pH- fO2 conditions reaches ~65 ppm at 250°C. In contrast, the maximum solubility of gold as AuHS -2 , the species normally assumed to control gold transport in epithermal systems, is approximately four orders lower at 250°C; at 150°C the solubility of AuNH3 +2 and AuHS -2 are essentially the same, i.e., ~9 ppb. A model for Au-Ag mineralization is proposed in which hydrothermal fluids were focused along NW-SE extensional faults and at the contacts of rhyolite domes and tuffs, and gold transport and deposition were controlled mainly by ammonia-dominated complexation and boiling-induced temperature decrease, respectively.</description><creator>Harlap, Ariel.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Gold ores -- Geology -- Guatemala -- Chiquimula.</subject><title>Alteration and ammonium enrichment vectors to low-sulphidation epithermal mineralization : insights from the Banderas gold-silver prospect</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5h73q073g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rn301504p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9306t2945</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:09:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>I present a method that regroups cis-regulatory modules by shared sequences motifs.

Gene expression profiling was performed on these clones to determine differentially expressed genes between the parental and resistant cells. DARPP-32 (Dopamine and cAMP regulated phosphoprotein of 32kDa) was, by far, the most overexpressed transcript. DARPP-32 is coamplified with ERBB2 on the same amplicon of chromosome 17.10 This protein has been mostly described in neurobiology, but DARPP-32 overexpression was recently reported in gastrointestinal, esophageal, prostate and breast cancer.11 Therefore, we suggest that overexpression of DARPP-32 can cause acquired resistance of breast cancer cells to trastuzumab. The in vitro knockout of DARPP-32, using stable shRNA transfection, abolishes the resistance to trastuzumab in the clones, while overexpression of DARPP-32 in the parental cells results in de novo resistance. Overall, our results suggest that DARPP-32 may be a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer patients who develop acquired trastuzumab resistance.</description><creator>Hamel, Sophie.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Breast Neoplasms -- drug therapy.</subject><subject>Drug Resistance, Neoplasm.</subject><subject>Antibodies, Monoclonal.</subject><subject>Dopamine and cAMP-Regulated Phosphoprotein 32.</subject><subject>Receptor, erbB-2.</subject><subject>Antineoplastic Agents.</subject><title>DARPP-32 expression in acquired resistance of breast cancer cells to trastuzumab</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pz50h0915.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jw827g45w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2z10wv13t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:09:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Distraction Osteogenesis (DO) is a technique for bone lengthening and filling of bone defects following trauma, infection or resection of tumors. DO consists of an osteotomy of the bone to be lengthened, followed by controlled distraction of the bone segments with an external fixator until the desired lengthening is obtained (distraction phase). This is followed by the consolidation phase, during which the external fixator is kept in place until the newly formed bone in the distracted zone consolidates. This phase is long and may cause numerous problems. Ongoing research aims at finding a method to accelerate the consolidation of the newly formed bone. Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGF) play a significant role in bone development and repair. FGF 18 has been shown to be the only FGF member to be expressed throughout both the distraction and the consolidation phases of DO. It was also reported that FGF18 is the physiological ligand of FGFR3. Therefore, we hypothesized that FGF18 and FGFR3 may have an important role in DO. To test this hypothesis, we investigated DO in FGFR3 deficient mice (FGFR3-/-). (FGF18 deficient mice are not viable). A miniaturized DO apparatus was applied to the tibia followed by an osteotomy. Distraction began after a 5-day latency period at a rate of 0.2 mm/12 hours for 12 days. Samples were collected at 3 time points comparing the mutants (FGFR3-/-) to their wild type litter' sates: end of distraction (17 days post-surgery), mid-consolidation (34 days post-surgery), and end of consolidation (51 days post surgery). The samples were analyzed using X-ray, DEXA, microCT, histology, biomechanical testing and Real-Time PCR. Our results revealed that FGFR3 deficient mice showed accelerated bone formation compared to the W.T. littermates at mid-consolidation where the parameters measured revealed increased bone mineral density, bone mineral content and trabecular number in the mutant tibial samples. The newly regenerated bone consolidated faster in the FGFR3 knock-out mice and the bone was of better quality as revealed by biomechanical tests in which more force was needed to break the mutant bone because it exhibited higher resistance than the age matched wild-type sample. The marker gene expression patterns revealed an up-regulation of chondrogenic markers that suggest that the knock-out mice follow the endochondral ossification pathway during DO. All results were statistically significant. These results show that signaling through FGFR3 acts to decrease bone formation during DO. Consequently, blocking FGFR3 may lead to accelerated bone formation in DO. This may have important clinical implications in attempts to improve the functional outcome of DO by decreasing the long duration that the external fixator has to be kept on.</description><creator>Hamade, Fares.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Mice.</subject><subject>Mice, Knockout.</subject><subject>Osteogenesis, Distraction -- methods.</subject><subject>Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor -- genetics.</subject><subject>Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3 -- genetics.</subject><title>Enhanced bone formation during distraction osteogenesis in FGFR3 deficient mice</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h702q9895.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2z10wv13t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Human Genetics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):16975</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
