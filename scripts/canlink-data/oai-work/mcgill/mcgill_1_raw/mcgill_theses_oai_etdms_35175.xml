These connections were reinforced with anchor bars welded to the steel angle at angles of 45$ sp circ$ and 90$ sp circ$, and/or with 90$ sp circ$ standard hooks at the ends, headed studs welded to a steel plate and some combinations thereof, representing the connections between precast double-tee flanges, or between a double-tee flange and lateral load resisting elements, One full-scale specimen (Connection Type Ap) was designed and subjected to reversed cyclic shearing loads to investigate the efficiency of utilizing the steel angle versus the steel plate. The effect of the varying ratios of reversed cyclic axial and shear forces on the different behavioral aspects of the connection, especially the shear response, including the hysteretic responses, yielding and ultimate loads, mode of failure, energy dissipation, displacement ductility ratios, etc. are reported. Based on the experimental results, the shearing force - axial force interaction diagrams and the associated equations and their normalized versions are derived for the different connection types subjected to combined cyclic loads. The design interaction curves and the associated equation for each connection type are also developed along with the simplified version as a useful tool for design of the connections subjected to combined seismic in-plane shearing and axial forces induced in joints during an earthquake. On the basis of the resisting mechanism observed experimentally and the physical models describing the ultimate behaviour of the connections, equations are proposed for shear and axial strengths of the various connections under static loads. Non-linear finite element analyses, using the NONLACS program, are conducted to study the nonlinear response of the connections subjected to pure monotonically increasing pull-out and shear loads, and their combinations until failure. The analytical interaction curves and the associated equations under combined monotonic pull-out (axial force) and shear forces are derived. The reduction factors to account for the lower strength under cyclic loads are derived empirically for these analytical equations. The simple modified analytical curves (for response under reversed cyclic loads) and their associated equations are developed for combined cyclic loading. The experimental results were compared with the predictions made using proposed methods, the CPCI design method and non-linear finite element analysis. In the final stage of this experimental-analytical program, practice-oriented methods are developed to determine the connection strength under shear and axial forces, and combinations of these forces at ajoint between elements in a precast system. Design guidelines are provided for increasing the strength and the displacement ductility of the connections and to improve connection performance. It is concluded that properly designed and detailed connections of these types, except Connection Type E, can be designed to perform adequately in an earthquake-resistant structure.</description><creator>Shariatmadar, Hashem.</creator><contributor>Mirza, M.

His contributions in the medieval period helped alter the course of mystico-philosophical tradition, which was then flourishing from Asia Minor and Persia to the major learning centers of the Arabic-speaking world. His importance was largely due to the complex mystical doctrine he expounded in the light of Ibn Sina's critique of knowledge. The age-old dilemma of knowledge was encapsulated in a famous declaration by Ibn Sina--the rationalist philosopher--who asserted that man is incapable of knowing intellectually "the realities of things," let alone the First Being. This did not imply that the realities were either unknowable in every sense, or that they did not exist. The question is in what sense and how are they knowable? It was Ibn Sina's special calling, Qunavi argued, to show the proper role and scope of reason in this quest. Philosophical knowledge may be represented chiefly through demonstrative logic, the only paradigm available to Ibn Sina. Qunavi on the other hand, set out to develop an exegetical grammar more suited to the movements of spiritual dialogue and paradox. For him, an intellectual knowledge of the "realities," in essence, rested on the relation between two distinct realities (subject and object). Yet all agreed that God's knowledge of Himself was the root of all knowledge. It had to transform utterly the distinction between the two realities. God's self-revelation is furthermore an unfolding book divulged through the infinite possibilities of linguistic construction. Mysticism's technical vocabulary had, therefore, to distinguish itself from, though without displacing, the bare skeleton of demonstrative logic.</description><creator>Shaker, Asaad.</creator><contributor>Ormsby, Eric (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Philosophy, Islamic.</subject><subject>Ṣadr al-Dīn al-Qūnawī, Muḥammad ibn Isḥāq, d. 1273 or 4.</subject><title>Technical language and experience in the mystical philosophy of Ṣadr al-Dīn Qūnavī</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1j92g9157.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dz010r91g</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Islamic Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z890rw22n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation presents both detailed experimental and extensive theoretical studies of optical wavemixing in nonlinear absorptive Kerr media. Non-degenerate two wave mixing (NDTWM) is a simple and powerful technique widely used to study the nonlinear refractive index and the grating decay time. It is unique due to its ability to separate the phase and the absorptive grating contributions. The work included in this thesis has evolved from trying to explain the unexplained results on the symmetric component of the NDTWM gain reported as "anomalous" behavior in ruby. We note that all previous theories for NDTWM have taken the approximation that the strong pump beam intensity was constant. In this approximation, the origin of unsymmetry in energy exchange between the two interacting beams was due only to the absorption grating of the weak probe beam. We have shown both experimentally and theoretically that the contribution of the absorption grating can be neglected but not the nonlinear bias absorption--just opposite to what had been common practice. Our approach also accounts for a range of inconsistencies related to intensity dependence of both the NDTWM gain and ratio of the imaginary to the real part of the nonlinear refractive index. Weakening the probe beam, earlier believed to improve accuracy of the approximation of the constant pump beam, actually destroys the symmetry of the energy exchange between the beams, enhancing the weak probe beam at the expense of the pump beam due to nonlinear absorption. This same two-beam coupling analysis has also been applied to interpret non-degenerate four wave mixing. Amplification of the phase conjugate signal is thus obtained. The spectral response in the frequency domain results in a tunable notch filter which can be controlled by the incident intensities of the pump beams.</description><creator>Skirtach, Andrei G.</creator><contributor>Simkin, David J.

The scope of the first laws and international treaties was limited to the regulation of navigation performed by a vehicle deriving its support in the air from reactions against the air, either aerostatic or aerodynamic. As technical developments have advanced, new vehicles capable of navigating in airspace have been invented using different principles of support in the air. Due to their different support in the air, they fail to comply with the definition of aircraft in its present wording, as set forth in the regulatory system of the Chicago Convention, the only multilateral international treaty dealing with basic aspects of navigation in airspace. Generally, there are at present three categories of vehicles capable of navigating in airspace---non-aircraft, state aircraft, and civil aircraft. Consequently, there are three legal frameworks---a legal trichotomy---to apply for navigation in the air. An analysis of this trichotomy and its impact on the safety of navigation is the objective of this thesis.

The transportation of dangerous goods regulated by specific international rules is a good illustration while the example of artworks carried to be exposed in temporary exhibitions is less famous. Their material protection is insured by museum professionals and specialized carriers. Their legal protection is insured on two levels: on one side, detailed customs procedures are set up to regulate their movement; moreover, specific contractual rules have been created by professionals, but they do apply international conventions relative to international carriers liability. On the other side, one usually chooses specific insurance policy called "a nail to nail" contract.

The first chapter will illustrate by a historical survey the evolution of the law and its impairment by an incoherent international realpolitik. Subsequently, the second chapter will analyze the present state of the law as reflected by the Statute of the ICC as well as the Statutes and jurisdiction of the ad hoc Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. It will thereby concentrate on the common elements of those crimes which form part of the jurisdiction of all the international criminal tribunals, i.e., "genocide", "crimes against humanity" and "war crimes."

Under these conditions, partially crystalline polymers undergo crystallization, which contributes significantly to their ultimate properties. While the thermal effects on polymer crystallization have been studied extensively, there is much less research carried out with regard to the effects of deformation and stress on crystallization kinetics. This is in part due to experimental difficulties in making appropriate measurements. In the present work, the Linkam Shearing Cell, in conjunction with a polarized light microscope, was used to study the effect of shear on the growth kinetics of various linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) resins. Simultaneously, an effort was made to evaluate the effect of shear on morphology. The experimental and analytical aspects of the work will be described, and preliminary results will be reported. The spherulitic growth rate increased under shear compared to that under quiescent conditions. The circular shape morphology of spherulites was obtained under the shear rate range of consideration (0--1 s-1). The effect of molecular structure in terms of co-monomer and branching content on spherulitic growth rate under quiescent and shear condition was observed. Moreover, the effect of temperature on growth rate under quiescent and shear (0.5 s-1) was studied. The modified Lauritzen-Hoffman equation was used to fit experimental data. The diffusion energy barrier under shear condition (0.5 s-1) was estimated and was found to be lower than the diffusion energy barrier under quiescent conditions.</description><creator>Tavichai, Orasa.</creator><contributor>Kamal, Musa R.

In the past, extensional flow measurements were not routinely performed because of the difficulties involved in extensional experiments. However, recent innovations have made it easier to study polymers under extensional flow and obtain reliable data. The objective of this research was to characterize polymers with respect to their extensional behavior and failure mechanism. Specifically, long-chain branched polyethylenes produced using constrained geometry catalysts were studied. The research was performed using a Munstedt rheometer, and data obtained by others using a RME rheometer and a capillary rheometer were also utilized. In uniaxial extension, strain softening behavior as well as strain hardening was observed. The polymers exhibiting strain hardening did so at strain rates from 0.005 to 2.5s -1 with an increase in stress hardening as the strain rate decreased. The results suggest the existence of a correlation between tensile stress at necking and number of branch points per molecule multiplied by the weight average molecular weight of the innerbackbone segments. It was concluded that the number of branch points per molecule in a long-chain branched polyethylene governs the level of strain hardening. Unexpectedly, it was found that necking in extensional flow correlates with gross melt fracture in entrance flow. Rupture in extensional flow was found to be chaotic in nature and could not be correlated with gross melt fracture.</description><creator>Torres, Enrique J.</creator><contributor>Dealy, J.

The challenges are not only to design RF transceivers in standard CMOS processes, but also to establish design methodologies and optimization techniques for their building blocks. This thesis is concerned with one of the key building blocks, namely the Low Noise Amplifier (LNA). Several low-voltage LNA's were successfully implemented in a standard 0.18 mum CMOS technology, operating in the 5--9 GHz frequency band, targeted for future wireless applications. A new and very simple gain control mechanism is suggested for the first time, which does not affect the optimum noise and impedance matching. The 8--9 GHz prototypes are the highest LNA frequencies reported to-date in CMOS. All prototypes exhibit gain tuning ranges of over 10 dB, and can operate from a supply voltage as low as 0.7 V. A design strategy for optimizing RF passive components (e.g. inductors, capacitors, and varactors) beyond 5 GHz is presented. An attempt is made to explore the possibility of using Micro-Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) in the RF arena.

The analysis is performed for two cases: two-dimensional and three-dimensional motion. At first, the equations governing the motion of such systems are obtained assuming that the system center of mass moves in a circular orbit around the Earth. Then, the various equilibrium configurations are obtained. The equilibrium configurations are classified in eleven groups. Three of these groups are collinear configurations, and the others are triangular configurations. A stability analysis is performed for each equilibrium configuration. It is found that two of the collinear configurations are marginally stable. These are configurations with the three masses on the local vertical. The other collinear configurations are unstable. The triangular configurations are unstable except for some systems with a small middle mass. The results for two-dimensional motion are consistent with those for three-dimensional motion.</description><creator>St-Amour, Amelie.</creator><contributor>Misra, Arun K.

A novel mechanism to form binary polymer blends is through phase separation by spinodal decomposition in the unstable region of the phase diagram. The overall objective of this work is to investigate the effects of thermally induced phase separation by spinodal decomposition on the morphology development of liquid crystalline polymer/polycarbonate blends and to obtain a thermodynamic binary phase diagram. The blends were obtained using a twin-screw extruder at various processing melt temperatures. To study miscibility of the blends and the resulting morphology, techniques such as differential scanning calorimetry and scanning electron microscopy were used. The liquid crystalline polymer/polycarbonate blend undergoes phase separation during thermally induced spinodal decomposition exhibiting a miscibility window reminiscent of a lower critical solution temperature. The blend is found to be miscible, when blend Tg slightly decreases. On the other hand, the blend is found to be immiscible as blend Tg increases.

In particular, the effect of the lateral boundary conditions on the sensitivity of the explosive to shock stimuli was investigated. The explosive was tested in a "gap test" arrangement. Various charge diameters and different materials for the capsule that contained the test explosive were used. The arrival time of the shock front was recorded at different locations along the test charge and the light emitted in the cases where detonation was initiated in the test explosive was monitored. It is found that the minimum shock strength necessary to initiate detonation in the explosive test mixture is greater if the test charge diameter is small. It is also found that for a given shock strength, the minimum charge radius that permits initiation corresponds to the distance necessary to establish detonation. In charges with small diameters, interactions between the input shock and the charge capsule walls permit initiation for input shock strengths that would normally not be sufficient to cause initiation. The nature of these interactions is complex and the outcome of a shock initiation experiment cannot be predicted from mere knowledge of the impedance of the capsule material or the shock speed within it.</description><creator>Jette, Francois-Xavier.</creator><contributor>Higgins, Andrew J.

Experimental tests performed in a spherical reactor (ID = 30cm) showed a high production rate of up to 9 g/h of fullerenes and indicated a good scale-up potential. CFD modeling demonstrated an increase of the C60 yield with the residence time of the precursor species in the 2200--2600 K temperature window for fullerene formation, but strong limitations from the reactor geometry. A new cylindrical reactor was designed (ID = 40 cm) with the flexibility to modify its length up to L = 100 cm. An improvement of the precursor residence time by a factor of 100 is calculated in the new reactor design. CFD Modeling and spectroscopy temperature profiles on off-core plasma regions are within the same scale. Low fullerene yield (1.2 g/h) suggests reactor wall temperature optimization. Fullerene yield increases as a function of reactor length.</description><creator>Harbec, David.</creator><contributor>Meunier, Jean-Luc (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Effect of the cylindrical reactor length on fullerene synthesis based on the thermal plasma dissociation of CCl</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cc08hh326.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xd07gv39h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:tt44pp82h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A series of three reinforced concrete columns was tested under simulated seismic loading to study the effect of the shear span-to-depth ratio on the shear transfer mechanisms. The full size columns were identical in cross section and steel detailing, the only difference being the shear span-to-depth ratio, with ratios of 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0. The specimens were designed and detailed to avoid flexural failure, and were loaded in reversed cyclic shear and moment until failure. This research project studies the two shear transfer mechanisms (compression field and direct strut action) observed in the reinforced concrete members. The capacity and behaviour of each specimen was predicted using a sectional response program (Response 2000), a two-dimensional non-linear finite element program (FIELDS), and the strut and tie method. These predictions, and comparisons with the actual experimental results, are presented and discussed. Guidance is provided for determining suitable strut and tie models to model both the compressive field and direct strut action of such columns.</description><creator>Gubbins, Julie.</creator><contributor>Mitchell, Denis (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Engineering, Civil.</subject><title>Strut action in columns subjected to seismic loading</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/th83m1151.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tt44pp82h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2227mr65v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis will examine the experiences of China's urban private businesspeople over the reform-era (1978--present). I will show that this socioeconomic group has experienced colossal improvements in the political, economic and social environment in which they operate their businesses. In contrast to the early reform years, in the 1990s businesspeople have, in the words of a businesswoman I interviewed, been "given the green light." The business climate is so favourable that successful private economic actors have become an elite and privileged group. However, no analysis of China's private businesspeople is complete without attention to the issue of gender. Persistent gender bias and discrimination against women in Chinese society has a negative impact on the ability of businesswomen to take advantage of the friendly new business environment and its attendant opportunities. The overall trend toward a basically positive business climate and the gender specific challenges experienced by businesswomen will be examined primarily by presenting personal portraits of four private businesspeople selected out of forty formal interviews conducted by the author in the spring and summer of 1998 in Tianjin city, northeastern China.</description><creator>Von Eschen, Kristin.</creator><contributor>Fong, Grace (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Bossen, Laurel (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Businesspeople -- China -- Case studies</subject><subject>China -- Economic conditions -- 1976-2000</subject><subject>Businesswomen -- China -- Case studies</subject><title>A green light for the Geti : the divergent experiences of male and female private entrepreneurs in reform-era China</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tb09j730p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2227mr65v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of East Asian Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:b8515q12j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This anthropological study focuses on people's subjective experiences of mental health problems in Quebec, and highlights the different processes involved in the narrativization and enunciation of the experience of psychiatric disorder. It was completed in Montreal in 2001, and included participant observation in three resources of the Regroupment des resouces alternatives en sante mentale du Quebec (RRASMQ). Nine people of Quebecois origin, users of these mental health services, were interviewed. After a brief survey of the literature concerned with the narrative transformation of experience and its expression in the social realm, this report identifies some of the narrative structures of the illness accounts that were collected for this project. I look, on the one hand, at the various languages used in the articulation of "mental illness", and on the other hand, at the power relations that are activated through the use of those languages. This study tries to determine to what extent it is possible for a sufferer of "mental illness" to empower him/herself through the narrativization and expression of one's experience of mental health problems.</description><creator>Vanthuyne, Karine.</creator><contributor>Corin, Ellen (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Mental illness -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</subject><subject>Mentally ill -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</subject><title>"Trouver les mots pour le dire" : s'approprier un certain pouvoir sur l'expérience de la folie à travers la prise de parole</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/37720f57d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b8515q12j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anthropology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mp48sf39c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This paper focuses on the evolution of the theme the Triumph of Death, the representation of the personification of death and the dead in the late Middle Ages. The first part of this thesis represents different points of view of art historians and historians concerning the death and the afterlife. There follows a short description and analysis of the cultural environment especially regarding literature which closely relates to the visual art and the representation of death. The last part describes three themes of death and the most important representations in frescoes, panels, bas-reliefs of the Triumph of Death evincing the main idea and the underlying structure and composition. Two different ways of representation can be distinguished: the Triumph of Death in the shape of the apocalyptic rider as appearing in the Revelation of Saint John the Evangelist and the Triumph of Death based on Petrarch's poem the Trionfi.</description><creator>Völser, Ingrid.</creator><contributor>Boker, Hans J.

The tensions within the family unit are one of the leitmotivs of Quebec theatre in the 1980s, which usually represents the mother either as a sort of monster who suffocates her children, or as a victim of the Law of the Father. When a woman decides to speak and to redefine motherhood, this dual model of the "patriarchal mother" crumbles and the universe of the family must be reconfigured. In this thesis, we propose a semiological analysis for each of the plays of our corpus. The first chapter analyzes Addolorata, by Marco Micone. In this play, the mother's taking possession of speech not only destabilizes her family but also calls into question established structures within the Italo-Quebecois community. The second chapter examines Marie Laberge's Aurelie, ma soeur, a play which illustrates the (re)construction of the family unit around a nonbiological maternal bond. The third and final chapter studies Michel Marc Bouchard's Les Muses orphelines, in which access to speech and to the condition of mother is achieved through lies and truth. In the conclusion of this thesis, we bring together the principal characteristics of the feminine and maternal voices which are heard in the three plays, voices which are all defined by the desire, the need to affirm their subjectivity.</description><creator>Tremblay, Janie.</creator><contributor>Everett, Jane (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Mothers in literature.</subject><subject>Micone, Marco.

Although humanitarian assistance has long been considered to be separate from politics, the division between the two has posed serious difficulties for humanitarian aid agencies responding to disasters and even has resulted in negative impacts on political and humanitarian aspects. In order to confront CHEs today, humanitarians need to collaborate conceptually and practically with political actors, while political actors need to be sensitive to humanitarian needs. A priority is considered the minimalist position, aiming at "doing no harm." Under the right circumstances, the maximalist approach can be viewed as an opportunity for maximizing the effects of humanitarian efforts to alleviate people's suffering and contributing to conflict resolution by employing humanitarian assistance as a powerful instrument.</description><creator>Tsunekawa, Hitomi.</creator><contributor>Brynen, Rex (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Disaster relief -- Political aspects.</subject><subject>International relief -- Political aspects.</subject><subject>Humanitarian assistance -- Political aspects.</subject><title>The interaction between humanitarian assistance and politics in complex humanitarian emergencies /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1g05fd53f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rv042v686</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:v118rg26z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Using the social sciences, demography and cultural history, this thesis examines the Irish Protestants of Montreal between 1834 and 1860. Its main focus is the communal identity that had both an Irish and British basis. Using national and political societies such as the Saint Patrick Society, Irish Protestant Benevolent Society as well as the Orange Order, the thesis demonstrates how the identity of the Irish Protestant was forged from relationships with other cultural groups of the city. Central to the development of a Protestant Irish communal identity separate from that of Irish Catholics was the increasing presence of Ultramontanism in the Saint Patrick Society, which Protestants were originally a part of. This prompted the Irish Protestants to form their own national society, (the Irish Protestant Benevolent Society) and to expand common interests based on Protestantism.</description><creator>Timbers, Wayne.</creator><contributor>Young, Brian (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Irish Canadians -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- History -- 19th century.</subject><subject>Montréal (Québec) -- Population.</subject><subject>Montréal (Québec) -- Social conditions.</subject><title>Britannique et irlandaise ; l'identite ethnique et demographique des Irlandais protestants et la formation d'une communaute a Montreal, 1834-1860</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sj139378g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v118rg26z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mw22v723z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The thesis examines the work of the media in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the post-war period and efforts to restructure its institutions and change journalistic practices. The main focus is placed the effort of the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe to facilitate "free and fair elections" in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the creation of the Media Experts Commission, which was to regulate the work of the media during this period. The difficulty that this Commission met during its work pointed to inadequacy of its mandate, as well as complexity of the issue of media transformation.

Canadians also claim that racism is much worse in the United States. Using extensive excerpts from in-depth interviews with Black and White educators in the Quebec English-language school system, the study examines ideological common sense arguments that legitimize, or else, argue away Canadian anti-Black racism. The study also documents the participants' accounts of racism and its effects. The study exposes arguments used to deny and justify racism, and discusses the disparate understandings of race-related concepts that make it difficult for dominant and oppressed racial groups to see eye-to-eye. The author then uses the findings of the study to answer and critique a 1998 article by S. Davies and N. Guppy that challenges the claim that there is anti-Black racism in Canadian education. The final chapter of the study suggests that the American literature on race is more relevant to the Canadian context than is often acknowledged. It suggests that anti-racist education in Canada has less to do with "giving teachers...strategies" for passing on "tolerance to the next generation" than with teaching teachers to examine their own assumptions. The author recommends that Canadian education be examined through a Critical Race Theory approach, which centers race.</description><creator>Howard, Philip, 1964-</creator><contributor>Pare, Anthony (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Blacks -- Education -- Québec (Province)</subject><subject>Teachers, White -- Québec (Province) -- Attitudes.</subject><subject>Race awareness -- Québec (Province)</subject><subject>Discrimination in education -- Québec (Province)</subject><subject>Multicultural education -- Québec (Province)</subject><subject>Racism -- Québec (Province)</subject><title>What racism? : an exploration of ideological common sense justifications of racism among educators in Quebec English-language education</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fb494b198.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ng451k38b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q811km45h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Knowing how to promote oneself in written self-promotional genres is a vital, yet neglected, component of non-native speaker (NNS) communicative competence. Focusing on the self-appraisal, I explore some of the impression management (IM) tactics and interpersonal metadiscourse (MD) markers used by writers to manage the impressions they give off. Of particular interest is the extent to which (a) patterns of self-presentation, and (b) language background (NS/NNS) contribute to the affective response of the reader. The self-appraisals, collected from 41 students taking a required undergraduate writing course, were grouped according to the affective response of independent readers. Patterns of IM and MD use were compared across positive- and negative-affect groups, and across NSs and NNSs. The findings reveal distinct differences between affect groups in patterns of IM and MD use.
