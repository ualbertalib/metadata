Domestic poultry constitute one of the largest reservoirs of Salmonella in animal populations. Susceptibility to this infection varies in different chicken lines suggesting the involvement of host genetic factors. The gene, Nramp1, and the locus, Lps, are well-characterized in the mouse and are known to be involved in the early, innate responses to Salmonella infection. In our laboratory, we have used a comparative gene approach to examine whether NRAMP1 and LPS are important to chicken salmonellosis. This thesis has continued our comparative examination through three objectives. The first objective was to determine the frequency of the NRAMP1 Arg223→Gln223 variant, originally found in Salmonella-susceptible chicken line C, in outbred chicken and pedigreed stock. Our second objective was to genetically map chicken TNC, a closely linked marker to LPS. A chicken backcross reference population was used to map this gene: the Compton mapping panel. We mapped TNC to microchromosome E41W17 in a region of conserved synteny with mouse chromosome 4 and human chromosome 9q. The third objective of this thesis was to develop chicken NRAMP1 antibodies in order to eventually characterize the protein's function and expression. The antisera raised in New Zealand White rabbits identified a 90--100 kDa species on a Western blot that most likely corresponds to the glycosylated chicken NRAMP1.</description><creator>Marshall, Jennifer.</creator><contributor>Malo, Danielle (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><subject>Biology, Genetics.</subject><title>A study of two candidate genes for resistance to salmonella infection in chickens : NRAMPI and TNC</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7m01bn539.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cr56n2989</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Human Genetics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xk81jn30g</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:57:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The cytoskeletal component of the muscle membrane, dystrophin and its associated proteins (DAPs), are essential for the maintenance of muscle integrity, since the absence of these molecules results in a variety of muscular dystrophies. The purpose of this work was to create and characterize monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) designed to recognize components of the DAP complex (DAPC), in order to provide tools for the study of its structure and function. The first mAb generated, 1137, was raised against a 33 amino acid sequence of the core protein at the c-terminus of alpha-dystroglycan (alpha DG), a cell surface member of the DAPC linked to dystrophin via its co-transcript, the transmembrane protein, beta-dystroglycan. 1B7 was used to perform a comparative study in denervated rat muscle tissue in parallel with IIH6, a mAb which recognizes a different, more glycosylated form of alpha DG. The second and third mAbs were raised against a complex of proteins purified by succinylated Wheat Germ Agglutinin (sWGA) following extraction from rabbit skeletal muscle.

The objective of the research is to investigate whether aging of oil-water interfaces and the formation of interfacial films retard dissolution of solutes from petroleum phases. The equilibrium partitioning and mass transfer rates of benzene and naphthalene in oil-water systems were evaluated experimentally. The research demonstrated that: (i) the mass transfer of the solutes from Brent Blend crude oil to water is retarded when the oil-water interface is aged; (ii) visually observable interfacial films are formed between gasoline and water when amended with asphaltenes or asphaltenes and resins; (iii) the mass transfer of solutes from gasoline amended with asphaltenes or asphaltenes and resins decreased by a factor of 2.3 to 66 between 4 to 35 days of interface aging and (iv) equilibrium partitioning is not significantly affected by amending the gasoline.</description><creator>Pasion, Catherine Rodriguez.</creator><contributor>Ghoshal, Subhasis (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Engineering, Civil.</subject><subject>Engineering, Environmental.</subject><title>The effect of interfacial films on mass transfer of benezene and naphthalene from NAPLs to water /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w66345622.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g445cg115</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wh246t78k</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:57:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L., Asteraceae) is an annual herbacious weed that is a troublesome pest in carrot fields of Southwestern Quebec. Over the past decade, ragweed has shown resistance to linuron, the only herbicide that is registered for post-emergence control of this weed in carrots. In this research, the degree of resistance to linuron was investigated for a ragweed biotype collected from a carrot field in Sherrington, Quebec, where a decreased performance of linuron had been noted. This biotype showed a linuron resistance ratio (I50) of 9.09, when compared with ragweed plants collected from a field never sprayed with this herbicide. The fungal pathogen Phoma sp., which had been initially isolated from diseased ragweed leaves in 1993, was considered as a potentially effective biological agent for the control of common ragweed. The pathogenicity of Phoma sp. was re-evaluated during the current research. This fungus was found not to have any appreciable virulence towards common ragweed; it is likely that virulence was lost during storage. Hence, twenty other fungal species were isolated from diseased common ragweed plants and assayed to determine their potential as biological agents against this noxious weed. Varying dew periods, temperatures, spore concentrations, host growth stages, and different types of carrier were evaluated. Only isolates ATT#9, INNA4a, INNA4b, ATT#10, ISO#65, and ISO#68 were able to induce lesions on ragweed foliage at spore concentrations of 106 to 107 spores ml-1, but only after an extended dew period of 48 hrs. No interaction effects on the degree of ragweed control were found when combining five fungal isolates and the insect, Ophraella communa LeSage. However, a possible interactive effect was detected when the fungal isolate ISO#65 and linuron were used in combination.</description><creator>St-Louis, Sophie.</creator><contributor>Watson, Alan K.

The growth cone, a sensori motor structure at the leading edge of the axon, expresses cell surface receptors for recognizing guidance and targeting signals. It also possesses the intracellular signal transduction machinery to convert the extracellular signals into the reorganization of cytoskeletal structures in inducing directed movement (guidance) or the cessation of movement (targeting). Accumulated evidence points to the importance of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in growth cone signaling. The signaling cascade linking tyrosine phosphorylation into the changes in growth cone motility, however, remains largely undefined. Previous studies suggest that the Dock/Nck adapter protein play a role in transducing tyrosine phosphorylation signals to the actin-based cytoskeleton to regulate growth cone motility. To gain insight into the Dock signaling pathway, we have sought to identify the downstream effector of Dock in photoreceptor (R-cell) growth cones in the Drosophila visual system. Our recent results indicate that Misshapen (Msn), a Ste20-like Ser/Thr kinase, functions downstream of Dock to terminate R-cell growth cones in the target region. First, like loss of dock, mutations in msn cause R-cell growth cone targeting defects. Second, Msn is expressed in R-cells and predominantly localized in R-cell growth cones. Third, overexpression of Msn induces the early growth cone termination, a phenotype that is opposite to the msn loss-of-function phenotype. Finally, Msn interacts with Dock physically and genetically. We propose that Dock-linked target-derived signals activate Msn, which in turn modulates cytoskeletal-related proteins within the growth cones in decelerating their motility when the axons reach their targets. To identify genes that genetically interact with Msn, I screened ~150 deficiency lines. I identified 29 cytological</description><creator>Ruan, Wenjing, 1967-</creator><contributor>Rao, Yong (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>The SH2/SH3 adaptor protein dock interacts with the Ste20-like kinase misshapen in controlling growth cone motility /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9s1618094.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k0698930d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bn999847x</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:57:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In the context of an object-oriented programming language such as Java, the ubiquitous use of instance fields and the presence of pointers (references to objects) make it difficult to understand a program's memory usage. Understanding memory usage is a key element for optimizing programs and side-effect analysis, an analysis to estimate variables that are inspected or altered by a computation, is of prime importance for understanding and optimizing Java programs. In this thesis, we study the impact of a set of practical side-effect analyses on optimizing Java programs. The main contribution of the thesis is the design and implementation of two groups of analyses, namely type-based analysis and refers-to analysis. These analyses use different strategies to capture the effect of an instruction on variables present in the program. The former uses type information whereas the second models the program's storage shape graph. In both type-based analysis and refers-to analysis, two variations of the analysis are presented, one which considers the internal structure of objects such as fields as a key element of the analysis, and another which considers objects as aggregates and ignores their internal structure. In order to assess the effectiveness of each analysis, we have implemented loop-invariant removal, an optimization which moves invariant computation out of loops. We used the Soot framework to implement the analyses and the optimization. We present both static and dynamic results based on experiments performed on a set of Java benchmarks of various sizes. Our results suggests that side-effect analysis is beneficial. Furthermore, we also notice that analyses that exploit the internal structure of objects, as a key element of the analysis, performs significantly better than their counterparts which do not.</description><creator>Razafimahefa, Chrislain.</creator><contributor>Hendren, Laurie (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>A study of side-effect analyses for Java /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6969z2679.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bn999847x</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h702q804n</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:57:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Female Sexual Dysfunction (FSD) is a significant problem affecting 25%--63% women in the U.S. alone. Although the research community has begun to increase efforts to understand FSD, there is a lack of an animal model in which this condition can be studied. The current research provides data for a new model of sexual arousal in the female Sprague-Dawley rat. The vascular effects in the clitoris and vagina in response to clitoral and pelvic plexus nerve stimulations were studied. Modulation of these effects by infusion of Nitric Oxide, Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide and Calcitonin-Gene Related Peptide agonists and antagonist in the clitoris was also observed. Histological sections of the clitoris were examined for the endogenous presence of these neurotransmitters.

Special cases of generalized gamma distributions include the exponential, gamma and Weibull distributions. A linear function of such variables is often a quantity of interest in the analysis of survival data, reliability of certain systems and stochastic processes and hence we present this problem in the context of life testing. The exact distributions of these linear functions are needed to compute survival functions, hazard functions and other important functions in practical problems. Stacy (1962) obtained some exact results involving generalized gamma variables and Huzurbazar and Huzurbazar (1999) used saddlepoint approximations where the input variables are gamma or Weibull. We examine this problem where the k independent real scalar random variables, X1, X 2,..., Xk, are of gamma type with general parameters. For this case, various exact distributions are obtained and it is shown that most of these representations are easily computable. These exact results are compared with the usual saddlepoint approximations. We also examine numerically inverting the Laplace transform in this context, showing that it is one of the most efficient and accurate ways of estimating the exact distribution for certain cases.

Genes of the growth hormone (GH) axis have been reported to affect the ontogeny and effector functions of cells of the immune system. Two strains of White Leghorn chickens bred for contrasting homozygous markers in the GH and GH receptor (GHR) genes were challenged with MDV. Contrasts for the significant interaction between marker genotype and tissue indicated that the GH/GHR marker genotype caused a shift in the distribution of the viral load in lymphoid tissues in the two strains. The analysis suggests that genetic variations in genes of the GH axis may differentially affect the host response to MDV replication in lymphoid tissues. Regarding the early time course of infection, at day 6 the viral load was highest in the thymus, while at day 10, it was highest in the spleen, indicating that the virus may have accumulated in the spleen or was continuing to replicate in this tissue.

In this work, we overcome this limitation using a novel approach which "lifts" a sequential dataflow analysis to a concurrent analysis. First, we introduce concurrency primitives which abstract away from the details of how concurrency features are implemented in real programming languages. Using these primitives, we describe how sequential analyses can be made applicable to concurrent programs. Under some circumstances, there is no penalty for concurrency: our method produces results which are as precise as the sequential analysis. Our lifting is straightforward, and we illustrate it on some standard analyses---available expressions, live variables and generalized constant propagation. Finally, we describe how concurrency features of real languages can be expressed using our abstract concurrency primitives, and present analyses for finding our concurrency primitives in real programs.</description><creator>Lam, Patrick, 1977-</creator><contributor>Panangaden, Prakash (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>A general framework for the flow analysis of concurrent programs /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5t34sm23p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4m90dx174</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1g05fd550</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:57:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Coliform bacteria have long been used to indicate fecal contamination of food, water, and solid surfaces, and thus the presence of a health hazard. In this study, the in-mill water and external effluent treatment systems of seven typical Canadian pulp and paper mills were shown to support the growth of numerous coliforms, especially Klebsiella spp, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., and Citrobacter spp . Mill coliforms were shown to be not just simple transients from feedwater or furnish (wood), but to be continuously growing, especially in the primary clarifiers. Therefore, coliforms and fecal coliforms cannot be used as fecal contamination indicators in pulp and paper mill water and effluent treatment systems. N2-fixing coliform populations were detected in mill water systems and were analyzed using N2-fixation assays and nitrogenase gene (nifH) probing. Both active in situ populations and cultured microbial isolates were tested. Active N2-fixation was demonstrated in six primary clarifiers. Measurement of the numbers and composition of the total culturable bacterial community in a primary clarifier revealed that approximately 50% of all aerobic cells contained nifH , of which &gt;90% were Klebsiella. Coliforms growing on MacConkey agar plates from the primary clarifier were all identified as Klebsiella and 100% of these Klebsiella contained the nifH gene. Preliminary estimates indicate that the amount of N2 fixed per day is substantial in some clarifiers.</description><creator>Gauthier, Francis.</creator><contributor>Archibald, Frederick (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Driscoll, Brian (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Sewage -- Microbiology -- Canada.</subject><subject>Paper industry -- Waste disposal -- Environmental aspects -- Canada.</subject><subject>Enterobacteriaceae -- Ecology -- Canada.</subject><subject>Wood-pulp industry -- Waste disposal -- Environmental aspects -- Canada.</subject><subject>Health risk assessment -- Technique.</subject><title>Study of coliform bacteria in Canadian pulp and paper mill water systems : their ecology and utility as health hazard indicators</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cc08hh37k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1g05fd550</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:r207tr08r</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:57:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis, we present a cognitive theory of object-oriented metrics and an empirical study which has as objectives to formally test this theory while validating the metrics and to build a post-release fault proneness prediction model. The four cognitive mechanisms which we apply in this study to object-oriented metrics are based on contemporary models of human memory. They are: familiarity, interference, fan effects and the span of working memory. Our empirical study was performed with data from a commercial Java application. We found that Depth of Inheritance Tree (DIT) is a good measure of familiarity and, as predicted, has a quadratic relationship with fault-proneness. Our hypotheses were confirmed for Import Coupling to other classes, Export Coupling and Number of Children metrics. The prediction model constructed had a good accuracy. Finally, we formulated a cost savings model and applied it to our predictive model. This demonstrated a 42% reduction in post-release costs if the prediction model is used to identify the classes that should be inspected.

Crosslinking ligation of CD40 induced p53, the p53-regulated CDKI p21Cip1/Waf1, and apoptosis in 3 lymphoma cell lines of a mature phenotype (A20, M12 and TA3), but not in 2 lymphomas of an immature phenotype (WEHI-279 and WEHI-231). Association of Mdm2 with p53 was reduced in A20. Expression of Bax and Bcl-2 was unaffected by CD40 ligation in all lines. Ligation of CD95 induced apoptosis in A20, not in M12, TA3 or WEHI-279. Crosslinking ICAM-1 on A20 had no effect on growth, but induced tyrosine phosphorylation of a 90--100KDa band in ICAM-1 immunoprecipitates, consistent with ICAM-1 itself. My results demonstrate that CD40 and CD95 differentially affect B cell lymphomas according to their developmental stage and show the potential for tumor suppression by signals that promote growth of non-transformed B cells.</description><creator>Gong, Qiaoke, 1956-</creator><contributor>Owens, Trevor (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</subject><title>Regulation of growth of B lymphoma by CD40, CD54lCAM-1, CD95 and CD95L</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0p096894k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j96022597</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zp38wf547</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:57:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Multiuser database systems require concurrency control in order to perform correctly. B-trees have become the standard data structure for storing indices that aid in data retrieval and there have been many algorithms published to enable concurrent operations for B-trees. Tries are another data structure useful for storing index data, particularly for text and spatial databases. Significant data compression can be achieved by using a trie to store index values. However, there have been no algorithms published to support concurrent trie operations. We present algorithms that enable concurrent searches and inserts for tries with pointerless representation. We also measure the performance of our algorithms and compare with that of the best B-tree algorithms. In order to measure trie concurrency, we survey a number of studies that have been made for B-tree concurrency. Using these published studies, we build a simulation model to measure the concurrency of our algorithms.</description><creator>Garton, Ian Spencer.</creator><contributor>Merrett, Tim H.

Pasture management provides the opportunity for farmers to maintain and improve the productivity of agricultural land, and to engage in sustainable ruminant production. An experiment was conducted on 42 hectares of pasture land to study the impact of management intensive grazing (MIG) on cow-calf productivity. The pasture area was divided into 18 paddocks and the experiment was conducted as a randomized complete block design with two blocks. The treatments were arranged as a 3 x 3 factorial of stocking rate and rotational frequency. The stocking rates (SR) were 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9 hectares per cow (HSR, MSR and LSR respectively); the rotation frequencies (RF) were two days, six days and continuous grazing (2d, 6d and C). Sixty-one purebred Angus cow-calf pairs were randomly assigned to each of the nine treatments, and the animals were grazed during two consecutive grazing seasons (1997 and 1998). Hay harvested early in the season was used for pasture supplementation late in the season. Increasing RF had no effect (P &gt; 0.05) on forage mass available. Increasing SR from 0.9 to 0.5 cow-calf pairs ha -1 resulted in a linear reduction (P &lt; 0.01) in individual cow gain, but increasing the SR caused a linear increase in cow gains ha-1. Calf gain ha-1 increased linearly (P &lt; 0.01) in response to SR, but was unaffected (P &gt; 0.05) by RF. A system of 6d rotation and high SR generated the greatest net revenue. The study showed little benefit of MIG on animal performance, but substantial benefits on efficiency of land use and economic performance.</description><creator>Bergeron, Michel, 1967-</creator><contributor>Phillip, Leroy (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Beef cattle -- Québec (Province) -- Cow-calf system.</subject><subject>Pastures -- Québec (Province) -- Management.</subject><title>Effect of rotation frequency and stocking rate on herbage quality and animal performance of cow-calf pairs raised on permanent pasture in Quebec</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f4752j607.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dr26z021j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Animal Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kp78gj154</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:57:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Recent evidence indicates that the UML (Unified Modeling Language) is the most preferred and widely used modeling technique for object oriented analysis and design. With UML becoming so popular, there is a need to have good quality assurance techniques for projects using it. Our focus in this study is on the inspections of UML design documents. The basic premise of software inspections is that they detect and remove defects before they propagate to subsequent development phases, where their detection and correction costs escalate. However, the cost performance of inspections can vary considerably, making it important to optimize inspections. Two approaches for optimizing inspections are: (a) controlling the inspection team size, and (b) discovering anomalous inspections that underperformed. This thesis first presents an empirical evaluation of the optimal team size for UML design inspections. Secondly, it presents an empirical evaluation of capture-recapture models for team sizes of 2 to 15 inspectors. Capture-recapture models can estimate the number of remaining defects in an inspected artifact, which can then be used to decide whether the artifact should be reinspected. Our results show that there is no single optimal team size. It in fact depends on various conditions such as the cost of defect detection late in the process, meeting duration and others. This thesis quantifies our findings. And we also found that no capture-recapture models were appropriate for making the reinspection decision as compared to the default decision of passing the document.</description><creator>Boodoo, Shaheen Banu.</creator><contributor>Madhavji, N.

Within this system, three-dimensional magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and two-dimensional digital subtraction angiography (DSA) vasculature information is combined with three-dimensional magnetic resonance (MR) and/or computed tomography (CT) anatomical information in order to benefit from the functionality of all modalities. MRA/MR/CT datasets are fused, and linked to the DSA images. The consistency of the linking procedure is verified by correlation of the DSA images with two-dimensional ray-traced projections of the MRA datasets. Organ contours are drawn on the MRA images, simultaneously visualised on their MR/CT counterparts, and projected onto the DSA images for visual feedback. This procedure allows users to incorporate both vascular and anatomical information in the three-dimensional target localisation and delineation process.

Litter bags were transplanted reciprocally into hummocks, hollows and lawns and retrieved after 1, 2, 3,11 and 15 months. Mass losses follow the trend: Chamaedaphne calyculata &gt;&gt; S. angustifolium &gt; S. fuscum. Between species differences were far more significant than differences between locations or depths, indicating that litter quality is the major control on decomposition. McHg concentrations generally increased during decomposition, particularly near the water table: for C. calyculata up to 13000%, for the two Sphagnum mosses up to 500%, suggesting that decomposition stimulates mercury methylation or McHg scavenging. The discovery of a high McHg substance on C. calyculata leaf surfaces (25 ng g-1) suggests that much plant MeHg data may by skewed by the presence of a biologically active 'film'.</description><creator>Branfireun, Marnie.</creator><contributor>Moore, T.

The transportation infrastructure is sophisticated and relatively efficient and it is not unusual for goods to be shipped by more than one mode of transportation. Unfortunately, private law has not kept pace with these infrastructure changes. Therefore, a different liability regime applies to every unimodal type of transportation. Though, each unimodal regime is usually based on similar principles they are sufficiently different, from each other, to create a great deal of uncertainty when trying to assess the liability of the participants, in the transportation venture. Such uncertainly is highlighted, for example, when the exact time of the loss or damage cannot be ascertained---which liability regime is applicable? An individual who engages a forwarder will not be particularly concerned with the above and generally assumes that by dealing with a forwarder, the forwarder will be liable for any loss or delay. Unfortunately, this is not always the case and depending on the terms upon which the forwarder contracts i.e. as agent, principal, carrier etc., and the application of any mandatory liability regime the forwarder may limit or escape liability altogether. Thereby leaving the customer without an effective remedy. In this thesis we have examined the common law evolution of the freight forwarder from their traditional role as agents to their modern sophisticated role, as a "one stop shop," which more closely resembles that of principal. With particular emphasis on how forwarders' have coped with the advent of multimodal transportation and its legal uncertainty.</description><creator>Beamer-Downie, Darcy.</creator><contributor>Milde, Michael (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Freight forwarders -- Legal status, laws, etc.</subject><subject>Liability (Law)</subject><title>Freight forwarders' liability during international multimodal transportation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ks65hd996.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mw22v726s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:j098zc90v</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:57:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The development of a communications infrastructure for the Shared Reality Environment, a high-end immersive, telepresence space, is described. Such a system must support low-latency, high fidelity, bi-directional audio and video transfer between a number of locations interconnected by an IP network. As a first attempt, MJPEG video, accompanied by monaural audio was transmitted between two laboratory spaces in the McGill Centre for Intelligent Machines. The relatively high latency resulting from JPEG compression and decompression motivated a hybrid approach in which raw data was selectively transmitted whenever the overhead in doing so was less than the cost of JPEG processing. Next, to scale up to the demands of transmitting multi-channel audio over greater distances, the protocol was refined and demonstrated by streaming, over the Internet, a live concert from McGill's Redpath Hall to an audience at New York University. This is believed to be the first-ever demonstration of this nature. While these experiments have proven successful within the limited context of their test environment, some challenges remain to be addressed in order for the system to support the full demands of a Shared Reality immersive telepresence application.</description><creator>Xu, Aoxiang, 1969-</creator><contributor>Cooperstock, Jeremy R.

The Agreement on the Joint Financing of Certain Air Navigation Services in Iceland, the main topic of this thesis, has ensured the availability of the service and facilities in the Reykjavik Flight Information Region, in accordance with the Standards and recommended practices of the Annexes to the Chicago Convention. The services were at first financed by the participating States, but later on user charges were gradually introduced and, since 1981, they became the principal means of services financing. During the last thirty years, a series of significant social, economic and technical developments has changed the aviation and the air navigation services environment. This thesis examines the evolution of the Agreement and the general technical and economic tendencies that are likely to affect its future. This thesis critically examines the Agreement in light of ICAO policy on the joint support aid and the general economic situation surrounding the Agreement.

A medium with both glucose and hexadecane was used to examine sophorolipid production. The sophorolipid was collected in a crystalline form. A modified control scheme that monitored the rate of dissolved oxygen (DO) consumption was successfully implemented to account for the weak or nonexistent minima in the DO. The effect of harvesting with the circulation pump off was also examined. An improvement in the usage of hexadecane due to increased carry over to subsequent cycles was observed. Production rates of sophorolipid were increased due to the higher initial hexadecane concentrations. Harvesting with the pump off also allowed the sophorolipid to precipitate, which improved the recovery of product. The yield of sophorolipid (g sophorolipid/g hexadecane consumed) was found to be inversely proportional to the initial sophorolipid concentration.</description><creator>Webber, Jonathan, 1969-</creator><date>2000</date><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Production of Sophorolipid from Candida bombicola using the self cycling fermentor</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5712m847p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ws859h39v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3n204095v</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:57:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>An electrochemical method of fabrication of (NiCoCrAlY)/MgO/Yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) multilayered coating was proposed. This multilayered coat is expected to work as a thermal barrier coating (TBC) for nickel superalloy substrates. The (NiCoCrAlY) layer was deposited using the electrophoretic deposition technique, the MgO layer was deposited by the electrolytic deposition technique and the YSZ layer was electrophoretically deposited. In order to study the deposit morphology and to determine the appropriate processing parameters for the multilayered coat, one-layer coatings of (NiCoCrAlY), MgO and YSZ were deposited and characterized. At first, the process of depositing (NiCoCrAlY) alloy particles using an aqueous media with AlCl3 or Al(NO3)3 as an electrolyte revealed that the alloy particles were deposited at the same time as aluminium oxide. The co-deposited aluminium oxide worked as a binder between the particles and the substrate. In the electrolytic deposition process of the MgO coating, the layer deposited from Mg(NO3)2 solution was mainly magnesium hydroxide and it had to be calcinated to form a MgO coating. An optimization of the deposition process demonstrated that a crack free deposit of MgO could be obtained at low current density. An optimum condition of the electrophoretic deposition process was established for YSZ; it was found that adding 5% water to the acetone bath increased the deposition rate of the YSZ particles, and had increased the porosity in the coat. A composite coating of (NiCoCrAlY)/MgO was formed after heat treatment at 850°C for 1 hr. The electrochemically deposited MgO was easily sintered at 850°C, which resulted in a dense ceramic coating that protects the substrate and the (NiCoCrAlY) coating from oxidation during sintering of the electrophoretically deposited YSZ layer at 1100°C.</description><creator>Hashaikeh, Raed.</creator><contributor>Szpunar, Jorzy (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Engineering, Materials Science.</subject><title>Fabrication of thermal barrier coating using electrochemical methods</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g732db761.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3n204095v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:j6731572j</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:57:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Bridges and highway structures designed and constructed without sufficient concern about durability are particularly vulnerable to early deterioration. To better understand the degradation mechanisms of chloride-induced corrosion, existing corroded structures need to be studied. The decommissioned Dickson bridge, built in 1959 in the eastern part of Montreal in Canada, provided an invaluable opportunity to assess the cause(s) of deterioration of a reinforced concrete bridge structure. The cause of premature deterioration was primarily the development of extensive chloride-induced corrosion of the steel reinforcement. McGill University, in collaboration with some industrial partners, and the Centre des Etudes et Recherche en Infrastructure Urbaine (CERIU) undertook a joint research program between 1997 and 1999. Intensive testing of the bridge deck confirmed the causes of deterioration and allowed for the validation and calibration of several testing techniques developed to determine the causes and the extent of the action of various processes related to durability of reinforced concrete structures.
