Prior to that, it was believed that beef could be produced economically only on cheap marginal land under a rather extensive system of farming. Since then, such factors as scarcity of farm labour, tendency towards specialization and good markets have influenced the production of beef cattle on the more fertile and extensively cultivated land. In this way, they are regarded as economical converters of unsaleable and bulky crops, as restorers of organic matter and fertility to the soil and as a means of utilizing more efficiently and economically available farm labour throughout the year.</description><creator>Mayers, John.

The greater part of the research done in this region has been to obtain the decay schemes of the various radioactive rare earth nuclides.

V. Regnault, as a product of the action of chlorine upon chloroform in sunlight (1). It is almost insoluble in water, but is miscible with chloroform, alcohol, ether and benzene (1, 2, 3). Its non-flammability and low cost are the chief factors combining to make CC14 one of the most widely-used volatile solvents today. Hardin (1) has prepared an interesting review which traces the history of CC14 through its various applications and uses. For approximately 12 years (1865-67), CCl4 had a short and unhappy trial as an anaesthetic, and was proven to be inferior to chloroform in this capacity.</description><creator>Maximchuk, Arlene.

The rate constant was given by 2.3 x 10^12 exp(-5,900/RT) cc mole^-1 sec^-1. The maximum production of oxygen atoms was found to correspond to the maximum amount of HCN produced in the active nitrogen-ethylene reaction. A rate constant of 1.83(+- 0.2) x 10^15 cc^2 mole^-2 sec^-1 was determined for the reaction of nitrogen atoms with oxygen atoms, in the absence of molecular oxygen, at pressures of 3, 3.5 and 4 mm, in an unheated reaction tube. The nitrogen atom consumption was estimated by titrating active nitrogen with NO at different positions along the reaction tube. Using the same titration method, the rate constant for the decay of nitrogen atoms, in an unheated vessel, was found to have the value of 5.2 x 10^15 cc^2 mole^-2 sec^-1, with y= 7.5 (-+ 0.6) x 10^-5, in the pressure range from 0.5 to 4 mm. Under similar conditions, and by similar methods, a value of 4.87(+- 0.8) x 10^14 cc^2 mole^-2 sec^-l was obtained for the rate constant of the reaction between nitrogen atoms and hydrogen atoms, over the pressure range from 2.5 mm to 4.5 mm.</description><creator>Mavroyannis, Constantine.</creator><contributor>Winkler, C.

The motives behind Canadian foreign aid were then analyzed and two dominating motives appeared evident - humanitarian, and enlightened ‘self-interest’. Chapter one, an analysis of the evolution of parliamentary policy of the three major Canadian political parties, revealed that there were no basic differences among the parties regarding the acceptance and support of foreign aid programs. Such differences as did exist were rather those of degree. Chapter two, an analysis of the administration of foreign aid, revealed that until 1960, the administrative machinery was not adequate to scope with the increasing scope of foreign aid, largely because of a divided responsibility.</description><creator>Matthews, Joan.</creator><contributor>Brecher, M.

No wonder then, except for Marshall, that the firm as a subject of study has been somewhat neglected. This political bias remained prevalent in the profession until quite recently. In the beginning, the main efforts were spent on the study of aggregates, for example, industries, and what is regarded today as macro-economies and economic development. The excursions into micro-economies were brief and were oriented towards the making of special tools to meat particular situations. The micro-theories of the 1870's are still the backbone of our body of economic knowledge in that area, although again and again they have been criticized as false and based on outmoded psychology.</description><creator>Martin, Fernand.</creator><contributor>Beach, E.

The method employed is based on the Impulse Approximation and the variable density Fermi gas model with a diffuse surface. Only those nucleons in the surface of the target nucleus are considered to be capable of contributing to direct interactions. Total inelastic scattering cross sections are presented, and then used to analyze the (p pxn) reaction cross sections of Au197. The method followed is essentially that already proposed by Kavanagh and Bell. Contributions from direct processes inside the nuclear volume have been accounted for by adding the results of Jackson, and Compound nucleus contributions have been ignored. Good agreement between calculations and experiment has been obtained.</description><creator>Mark, Shew-Kuey.</creator><contributor>Kavanagh, T.

In the endeavour to achieve more self sufficient machinery, units called "controllers" were invented to replace man's supervision of machines. Process control engineering is the study and design of such "controller" systems. In a feedback control system the control philosophy is that of generating some function of the output, comparing this with an input signals and generating an error signal with which to control the process.

The broad characteristics of EEG to be found within this range have been outlined by Lindsley (1960): “----- the most aroused or excited state behaviorally is represented by a low voltage fast EEG picture, and is paralleled by poor attention and behavioral efficiency.”</description><creator>MacNeilage, Peter.

However, during the last seven years, with the assistance and encouragement of the Newfoundland Government, mink ranching has been co-ordinated and largely centralized near the southern end of Trinity Bay. This region of the Avalon Peninsula was chosen for several reasons, the most important of which was its close proximity to a supply of a large variety of marine products.

(Map 2) (Piloski 1954). Highly metamorphosed paragneisses and gneisses of granitic composition are the major rock-types, but granite and quartzites occur as well. The bedrock is generally coarse grained and weathered into a very rough surface, on which striae are usually absent. In the areas of gneiss, the local variation in petrography is large, as quartz-inclusions and inclusions of granites are numerous (Ill. 80). Because of this, the identification of erratics is extremely difficult, and in no case was the source-area of a suspected erratic boulder determined.</description><creator>Löken, Olav.

All animals were constantly supplied with food and water, with either one or two rats in a cage. The apparatus was a slight modification of the one used by Thompson and Bryant (195.5). It consisted of a V-shaped choice chamber, 5" wide at the narrow end and 14" wide at the wide end, and a goal box, 14" wide and 12" long. Both choice chamber and goal box bad light-brown walls 13" high. The choice chamber had a grid floor, while the floor of the goal box was made of wood. Two windows at the wide end of the choice chamber, each 4" x 41/2", 3” apart and 1” from the bottom, provided the only entrances into the goal box.</description><creator>Liss, Philip.

R. Crowell derived a work function difference between the normal and superconducting states, in terms of the energy gap of a superconductor, from the difference in the free energy between the states. The design and use of a retarding potential planar diode, and the associated circuitry required to observe temperature dependent work function changes near 4°K, are described. Measurements were carried out on a lead sample, above and below its superconducting transition temperature (7.2°K). The failure to observe work function changes related to superconductivity is discussed in terms of a different approach to the theory.</description><creator>Lichtenberger, Gunter.

In 1900, Lewis (2) observed that the glow persisted for some time after the discharge had ceased and made a number of studies of the spectrum of the glowing gas. Strutt (later Lord Rayleigh) investigated the phenomenon in a more systematic manner (3,4,5,6), and discovered that the glowing gas bad rather remarkable chemical properties. He named the glowing gas "active nitrogen", and suggested that many of its properties could be attributed to the presence of atomic nitrogen.</description><creator>Levy, Eric.

By using the Faraday Cup and the ionization chamber, it is possible to measure the beam current over a range 10^-14 amp. to 10^-8 amp. An integrator circuit providing the suitable ranges was built and calibrated to 0.4% accuracy. For low beam intensity, high background and short burst experiments, the C11 activation method is recommended. The cross section for C11 activation has been measured to be (63.8 +0.8/-0.6) mb for 96 Mev protons. This will then provide an additional accurate monitor for beam intensity.</description><creator>Lee, Jonathon. K.</creator><contributor>Frisken, W.

In particular, it passes from the paramagnetic to the anti-ferromagnetic state at a Néel temperature of 177 K and from the antiferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic state at a Curie temperature of 88 K. It has very recently been determined by neutron diffraction studies that the antiterromagnetic state has a spiral magnetic configuration in which the atomic magnetic moments are lined up ferromagnetically in the basal planes of the hexagonal close-packed lattice.</description><creator>Landry, Peter.

One phase is comprised of either cellular or intracellular material which performs the specific function characteristic of the tissue (for example contraction in the case of the muscle or conduction in the case of nerve). In brain this phase consists of the neurons with its nucleated cell body, axons and dendrites. The other phase is extracellular and contains those anatomic elements and associated fluids essential for the physical support and nutritive maintenance of the cellular phase. In addition there are blood vessels, interstitial fluids, and non nervous connective tissue; the ependyma which lines the ventricles, the neuroglia cella and fibers.</description><creator>Lahiri, Sujata.</creator><contributor>Quastel, J.

This endoparasite was subsequently transferred by Leidy (1879) to his new genus, Endamoeba. A few years later, Casagrandi and Barbagallo-Rapisardi (1895, 1895a) thought, in their turn, that the parasitic amoebae should be separated generically from the free-living ones. But, unaware of the existence of the genus Endamoeba, they proposed Entamoeba as a generic name for both Amoeba blattae and for the large non-pathogenic amoeba of the human intestine, Amoeba coli Grassi (1879).</description><creator>Lachance, Philip.</creator><contributor>Cameron, T.

It operates on the pressure differential between the atmosphere and a 320 cu. ft. vacuum. storage tank. The running time for Mach number of 1 .8 is in the vicinity of twelve seconds with a test section area of approximately four sq. in.. Theoretical as well as experimental performance curves for the wind tunnel are presented. Calibrations of a Mach 1.8 axisymmetric nozzle and a Mach 1.8 two-dimensional nozzle are given in detail. The Mach number distribution compares favourably with other supersonic wind tunnels. The tunnel is being used to study supersonic flow in ducts, and problems concerning multiple shock waves and orifice experiments.</description><creator>Kwok, Chi. K.</creator><contributor>Newman, B.
