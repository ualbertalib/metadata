The labelled lipid moiety appears in the circulation after a shorter lag period than the protein indicating that the two components are not synthesized simultaneously. Puromycin inhibits the release of labelled lipoprotein following a delay which is due to exhaustion of an intracellular pool of apolipoprotein. More labelled lipoprotein lipid is released by the perfused liver when whole blood is used as the perfusate than when an albumin-Ringer preparation is used although there is no additional glyceride release. This indicates that there is an exchange of lipid between liver and plasma lipoprotein. This exchange has also been demonstrated by following uptake of doubly labelled lipoprotein by the perfused liver. The lipid component disappears more rapidly from the perfusate than the protein. Lipoprotein triglyceride is removed intact by the perfused liver in a three-stage process, initial trapping of the entire lipoprotein molecule, exchange, and uptake. The lipid fatty acid is incorporated primarily into liver phospholipid. The exchange has also been demonstrated in vivo where it appears more rapid indicating the participation of other tissues.</description><creator>Buckley, James T.</creator><contributor>Rubinstein, D.

Extensive studies have revealed that these waves can be propagated in any direction on ail planes of anisotropic crystals. Near certain directions, in which the normal surface wave degenerates continuously into the transverse bulk wave, the penetration of the surface wave into the solid is deep. However, near these special directions, pseudosurface waves that can be propagated for a wide range of directions are found, and their form is explained. The effect of water loading on the propagation of both normal and pseudo-surface waves is also investigated. A gradient Method of finding the power-flow directions for normal surface waves has been developed. The results are compared with the more standard Poyntingvector method. The calculation of power-flow directions for pseudo-surfaces waves is also illustrated.</description><creator>Lim, Teong C.</creator><contributor>Farnell, G.

When the excretion of delta-5-pregnenediol glucuronide and sulfate by normal and hypertensive individuals was compared, no significant differences were observed. From the urine of normal and hypertensive subjects given pregnenolone-7-alpha-3H intravenously, we have isolated labeled delta-5-pregnenediol glucuronide and delta-5-pregnenediol sulfate, and determined their specific activity. No significant difference existed between the specific activities of the urinary delta-5-pregnenediol glucuronides as estimated in both groups of subjects. However, when the specific activities of urinary delta-5-pregnenediol sulfates were compared, it could be seen that the specific activity was significantly higher in hypertensive subjects.

Methods of interpretation of the gravity anomalies of a two dimensional structures based upon the first and the second horizontal derivative of gravity are discussed. Expressions are obtained showing the relationships between the parameters of the various two-dimensional structures and the position and amplitude of the second, derivative maximum and minimum. The Fourier transform formulas for the gravity anomalies of the two-dimensional structures are derived. For small values of omega, the Fourier transforms give valuable information about the parameters of the structures. Under favorable conditions the amplitude spectrum of the Fourier transforms can give information about the depth as well as the inclination of the anomalous mass. The validity of the new formulas and the suitability cf the new interpretation techniques are tested by comparing results obtained from field measurements with the known geology of the structures.</description><creator>Sharma, Bijon.</creator><contributor>Geldart, L.

Actinomycin D affects with difficulty RNA synthesis and cytochrome c induction under the influence of oxygen in a brewer's strain of the yeast S. cerevisiae. Proflavine is completely and immediately effective in inhibiting RNA synthesis in these cells. The rapidly labelled RNA fraction decays to acid-soluble nucleotides at two different rates. Alpha-amino levulinic acid synthetase activity in these cells is reduced dramatically in the presence of oxygen. This effect of oxygen is not due to a repression of synthesis of the enzyme but appears to be dependent in some way on protein synthesis. Results indicate that oxygen-induced cytochrome c synthesis in these yeast cells involves de nova protein synthesis and is dependent on newly formed RNA of a limited lifetime; the induced synthesis, however, is not dependent on an increased formation of precursors of the prosthetic group.</description><creator>Salem, Annette.</creator><contributor>Quastel, J.

It operates in the energy range from 0 to 25 eV with a resolution of 0.35 eV and a reproducibility of ± 0.17 eV. Preliminary studies of hydrogen indicate reproducible structure in the dissociative attachment process known to occur between 8 and 10.7 eV. Four resonances attributed to dissociative attachment in chlorine have been identified with peak values at 0, 1.75, 3.07 and 5.9 ± 0.17 eV. The first three resonances have the same dissociation limit, while the fourth is distinct and contains reproducible structure. At higher energies, an excitation process and ion pair formation have been identified. Similar dissociative attachment processes in bromine give rise to resonance peaks at 0.05, 0.98 and 3.30 ± 0.17 eV. AIl of the processes lead to the same dissociation products. For iodine, dissociative attachment peaks arise at energies of 0.28, 0.58 and 2.15 ± 0.17 eV. AIl three processes produce products in the same energy states. A sharp break at 8.27 ± 0.17 eV is attributed to the initiation of ion pair formation.</description><creator>Moe, Hou-Kiat.</creator><contributor>Goodings, J.

Extracts made from the guinea-pig stomach, given intraduodenally at the time of ligation had a protective effect upon gastric ulceration in the Shay rat. The cortisone-induced acid hypersecretion observed in guinea pigs could be increased following a) enhancement of histamine synthesis and b) inhibition of the oxidative deamination of histamine. It could be decreased following a) suppression of histamine synthesis and b) enhancement of the oxidative deamination of histamine. A histamine metabolite, alpha-N, N-dimethylhistamine, hitherto not found in mammalian tissue was detected in the stomachs of cortisone treated guinea-pigs.

This last conclusion was reached from the observations that: (a) Preincubation of tissue et 0ºC - rather than at 37ºC - followed by incubation of the media at 37ºC led to an increased formation of 14-C-corticosterone from 14-C-progesterone, concomitant with a lesser accumulation of ll-beta-hydroxyprogesterone.

Call suspensions of other lymphoid organs, obtained from normal rabbits, failed to respond in this fashion. This in vitro response did not occur with bone marrow cells of immunized rabbits, although it was observed with lymph node and spleen cells obtained from previously immunized rabbits. The immune nature of the bone marrow blastogenic response was demonstrated by the detection of specific antibody, by the fluorescent antibody technique, within the stimulated cells. The response of the bone marrow cells was localized to the lymphocyte-enriched cell fraction following centrifugation of the whole bone marrow in a linear sucrose density gradient. The findings suggest that the bane marrow lymphocyte plays an important role during the induction of a primary immune response.</description><creator>Singhal, Sharwan K.</creator><contributor>Richter, M.

A marked activating effect results by the combined addition of BaCI and CoCl2 for the histochemical demonstration of the hexosemonophosphate2 shunt enzymes. A semi-quantitative index was derived for assessing the activity of these enzymes in the macula densa (MDL), with parallel measurements of the juxta-glomerular cell granularity (JGI) and renin. Complete aortic ligature between the two renal arteries in rats over 300 g consistently produced atrophic left kidneys accompanied by hypertension. JGI and MDI studies on sex and various strains of rats did not reflect significant differences. However, a zonal distribution of these two parameters was observed. In dogs and beavers, a similar distribution of the JGI was also encountered.</description><creator>Rojo-Ortega, José-Manuel.</creator><contributor>Diaz, C.

A decrement in urinary excretion of uric acid without rise in plasma urate concentration is also evident in these patients. Hyperuricemia per se does not appear to influence the mechanisms of urine acidification, since the induction of an acute hyperuricemia fails to modify urinary pH, renal excretion of titra table acid and ammonia in the mongrel dog. Experiments performed in both mongrel and dalmatian dogs reveal that ammonia is the main adaptive mechanism for hydrogen excretion during either acute or chronic metabolic acidosis. Furthermore, the increment in urinary ammonia occurs rapidly and is not influenced by prolonged sodium restriction. [...]</description><creator>Plante, Gérard E.</creator><contributor>Browne, J.

In the cortex of the thymus, these cells formed a continuous layer on the inner surface of the capsule and around vessels, and constituted a loose network over the remaining of the cortex. In the medulla, two zones were distinguished: the "outer medulla" in which cell web-containing reticular cells were abundant and formed a dense network and the "inner medulla" in which no such cells were found. In the spleen, cell web-containing reticular cells were abundant in the periarterial lymphatic sheaths and formed a distinct layer separating the white pulp from the marginal zone. They also formed a delicate layer separating the germinal center from the cortex of lymphatic nodules. Thus, the thymus and spleen appeared to be compartmentalized by sheaths of TPA-stained reticular cells.</description><creator>Pereira, Gérard P.</creator><contributor>Leblond, C.

The results of these experiments provide a quantitative assessment of the convergence of limbic input to the tuberal and lateral hypothalamus, establish the ventromedial nucleus as a focal object of limbic influence, and identify two functionally distinct amygdaloid efferent pathways which reach identical neurons within the ventromedial nucleus. In addition the extreme sensitivity of the hypothalamic. response to variations in the frequency of impulses arriving from the amygdala is shown. Finally, the presence of inhibitory interneurons within and near the lateral border of the ventromedial nucleus is demonstrated using physiological criteria, and morphological identification of these interneurons is tentatively provided.</description><creator>Murphy, John T.</creator><contributor>Gloor, P.

Such tumors, which can be malignant, were induced by x-irradiation, radioactivity, or prolonged low-iodine diet, alone or in combination. Thyroid glands were examined in serial sections; and, quantitative data were obtained on the incidence of tumor-bearing animals, the number of tumors per gland, and the total volume of tumors per gland. Hyperplasia, associated with low-iodine diet, induced in six to twelve months a greater yield of tumors than did radiations in the doses employed. However, when radiation was followed by hyperplasia, the yield was much more than expected by a simple additive effect of these two factors. The interpretation is that in carcinogenesis of the thyroid, radiation acts as an 'initiating' agent, whereas hyperplasia acts as a promoting agent (possibly also as an 'initiating' agent).</description><creator>Mandavia, Mansukhlal G.</creator><contributor>Leblond, C.
