This is also a key issue in more serious applications like an automobile driver  training simulator. In order to determine where the vehicle is at any time, while  the speed is controlled with the trainee's accelerator pedal, we need a  computationally efficient way to establish this position by, say, defining an arc  length parameterized curve to represent the "road" or other trajectory  constraint. To compute the are length of a parametric curve or define the arc length  parameterized curve using the analytical methods compromises many real-time  simulations where designers compete to continuously add realism enhancing visual and  audio effects. In this thesis, an efficient and novel way to parameterize a cubic  curve with respect to arc length is adapted and implemented. Its use in real-time  application is demonstrated and its performance is compared to that of another  recently proposed method. The main advantage of our approach is the simplicity. That  is, Bezier segments are subdivided as required and arc length parameterization is  obtained offline for fast look-up, thus requiring less computation in  real-time.</description><creator>Jin, Ming, 1975-</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Arc length based parametric cubic curves for real-time video gaming</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6682x455s.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j6731452v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:w95051089</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis argues that in North America since the late 1980s,  young women's interest in feminism has been expressed through participation in  feminist music subcultures. The project provides an overview of the studies of  culture, musical subculture, and gender and music making, as well as an historical  context of feminism and a discussion of the relationship between second and third  wave feminism. The first case study explores Riot Grrrl's roots in the DIY  activism of DC hardcore punk, its links to the female-oriented indie music scene of  Olympia, Washington, and the subculture's use of alternative media. The second study  examines efforts to integrate queer politics into third wave feminism through  lesbian punk rock music subculture. The final study of electronic feminist punk rock  examines how young feminists use alternative media such as zines, internet message  boards, web sites, music making, and performance to educate young women about sexual  abuse and homophobia. Analysis of the Riot Grrrl, lesbian punk rock, and electronic  feminist punk rock subcultures demonstrates how young women claim spaces for their  own feminist politics, even if they have gone relatively undetected by the  mainstream culture.</description><creator>Wilson, Angela, 1979-</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Lesbian musicians</subject><subject>Feminism</subject><subject>Feminism and music</subject><subject>Lesbian feminists</subject><subject>Punk rock music</subject><title>After the riot : taking new feminist youth subcultures seriously</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xd07gt24p.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w95051089</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:d217qq113</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Wind generation has become the most important alternate energy  source and has experienced increased growth in Europe during the past decade while  more recently, the same trends have been exhibited in North America. Although it has  great potential as an alternative to less environmentally friendly energy sources,  there are various technical challenges that cause wind to be regarded negatively by  many utilities. Others are hesitant to accept its widespread implementation,  particularly when the penetration of wind in a given area is high. This work presents the addition of an energy storage system to a  wind turbine design. Various advantages are exhibited for the wind turbine with  energy storage. Firstly, the generator is capable of accurately controlling the  output power of the generator and inevitably of the wind park. Reactive power  requirements are also reduced as a result of a more stable voltage at the point of  interconnection. In addition, improved transient performance is exhibited for  various local disturbances.</description><creator>Abbey, Chad</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Environmental Sciences.</subject><subject>Energy.</subject><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>A doubly-fed induction generator and energy storage system for wind power applications /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3f462604x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d217qq113</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4b29b661z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Numerous ethical guidelines are referred to when medical  research is conducted on human participants. These guidelines include the Nuremberg  Code, the Declaration of Helsinki, and the International Ethical Guidelines for  Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects. From a Western viewpoint, these  guidelines may seem like well-reasoned, universally applicable codes for conducting  medical research on human subjects. Some of the guidelines, however, merely impose  Western values on developing countries without giving adequate consideration to  their worldviews. I explore the applicability of current codes and guidelines of  ethics on medical research with human subjects to the Zulu of South Africa and the  Kikuyu of Kenya.

The literature in  International Relations (IR) understands this concept as a relation, a resource, a  structure, or a social element that changes the behaviour, the position, or the  identity of an actor. Power is therefore understood as a "cause". Yet, at  the methodological level the causal conception of power is not fruitful. This thesis  offers a non-causal conceptualization of power. After reviewing the IR literature on  power, it shows that power is a spectacular instant-image that emanates from the  "screenal " space. This definition is based upon the under-researched  variables of "time" and "space" of power. The argument relies  both on an "instantaneous" temporal understanding (phenomenology, factual  history) and on a "videopoliticized" spatial understanding (television  screen as political space) of international affairs.</description><creator>Vanhooren, Jérémy</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Power (Philosophy)</subject><subject>International relations</subject><title>"Temps" et "espace" de la puissance : instantanéité et image dans la compréhension du concept en relations internationales</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4b29b6627.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8g84mm82x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5712m7181</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Ce travail est une analyse historique de l'experience migratoire  feminine, examinee par le coin de femmes emigrants grecques.

Assuming that the separation of magic and religion is the symptom of cultural  clashes. I argue that Iamblichus' (240-325 AD) De Mysteriis was participating in a  politico-religious reorganization of the Roman Empire. The first part of the study analyses the religions beliefs of  Porphyry (232--305 AD). With this analysis, I demonstrate that Iamblichus rectified  Porphyry's philosophical approach to religion, which minimizied the distinctions  between magic and religion. In the second part of the study, I demonstrate how Iamblichus'  response to Porphyry rearranged religious evidence into a new holistic system called  "theurgy." By drawing from Neoplatonic political theory, I also explain  how the De Mysteriis inseparably bounded politics with theology.</description><creator>Dufault, Olivier</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Supernatural</subject><subject>Iamblichus, ca. 250-ca. 330.

New techniques are developed, pharmaceutical companies  manufactured thousands drugs and medical devices each year, these products are put  on the market immediately; therefore, the consequences can be  terrible. In the US, thousands even millions of people suffer from  personal injuries because they use a defective medical product; this is referred as  a mass tort. The class action procedure is often used in order to repair these  personal injuries. Plaintiffs always ask for the use of this procedure, but the  federal American courts always refuse the certification of the class because the  conditions of Rule 23(b)(3) are not fulfilled. This is what is called "the new  trend of American courts". The non application of the class action procedure leads to  terrible results; victims of a defective medical product cannot receive compensation  for the injury they are suffering from. These victims choose the class action  procedure because of its advantages, if the class action is not certified they won't  sue individually. If the real problem was the non respect of Rule 23(b)(3)'s  conditions, a modification or a reform of the Rule would have been done.  Unfortunately the laxity of the federal judges tends to influence the American  Congress who ignores the need for a reform of this rule. This makes us wonder what  the real justifications motivating this refusal of certification  are.</description><creator>Edery, Betty</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Products liability -- United States</subject><subject>Medical instruments and apparatus -- Law and legislation -- United States</subject><subject>Medical instruments and apparatus -- Safety regulations -- United States</subject><subject>Class actions (Civil procedure) -- United States</subject><title>L'action de groupe est-elle une procédure adaptée à la responsabilité du fait des produits médicaux aux Etats-Unis?</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pc289j56g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pv63g075x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hx11xf83q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A divisive reorganization involves a series of transactions  having as effect and purpose the division of the trading activities carried on by a  single company or group of companies between two or more companies or groups of  companies. This can be achieved by a sale of assets or by a transfer of shares  belonging to the corporation to be divided, which would generally give rise to  taxable capital gains. The thesis analyzes the tax implications of these two  approaches, with particular focus on the latter, attempting a comparative view over  the UK and Canadian relevant provisions. The two substantive chapters present the UK  and, respectively, Canadian rules governing the treatment of disposal of corporate  assets and shares, the available reliefs from capital gains taxation, as well as the  special requirements for achieving tax-free demergers. Conclusions are aimed at  suggesting a more simplified approach for Canadian divisive reorganizations, with a  greater degree of codification.</description><creator>Georgescu, Ana-Luiza</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Corporate reorganizations -- Great Britain</subject><subject>Corporation law -- Canada</subject><subject>Corporate reorganizations -- Canada</subject><subject>Corporation law -- Great Britain</subject><subject>Taxation -- Law and legislation -- Canada</subject><subject>Taxation -- Law and legislation -- Great Britain</subject><title>Certain tax aspects of corporate divisive reorganizations in Canada and the UK</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rf16h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hx11xf83q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6d56zx098</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a widespread, maternally  inherited trait that results in an inability of plants to produce functional pollen.  The Ogura CMS system originated in radish, but has since been transferred to, and  confers male sterility on, plants in the related genus Brassica . A gene which  restores male fertility is needed for the Ogura CMS system to be exploited  commercially for hybrid seed production in oilseed species such as Brassica napus.  The restorer gene Rfo is a dominant radish nuclear gene that restores the male  fertility to plants with Ogura cytoplasm. This gene has been transferred into  Brassica napus through intergeneric crosses; however the introgressed segment of  radish DNA contains an unknown number of genes, some of which confer undesirable  traits, such as an elevated content of seed glucosinolates, antinutritive compounds  that render the seed meal unusable as animal feed. A fine scale linkage map of the  region in radish containing Rfo was constructed, and a map-based cloning approach  relying on synteny between radish and Arabidopsis was used to clone Rfo. A radish  gene encoding a 687 amino acid protein with a predicted mitochondrial targeting  presequence was found to confer male fertility upon transformation into Ogura CMS B.  napus . This gene, codes for a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR)-containing protein  with multiple, in this case 16, PPR domains. Two similar genes that do not appear to  function as Rfo flank this gene. A transcript representing a non-functional allele  (rfo) was detected in sterile radish plants. Comparison of the Rfo region with the  syntenic Arabidopsis region indicates that a PPR gene is not present at the  Rfo-equivalent site in Arabidopsis , although a smaller and related PPR gene is  found about 40 kb from this site.</description><creator>Wargachuk, Richard Burns</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Cytoplasmic male sterility.</subject><subject>Rape (Plant) -- Cytogenetics.</subject><subject>Radishes -- Cytogenetics.</subject><subject>Radishes -- Genome mapping.</subject><title>Fine mapping and functional analysis of the radish Rfo nuclear restorer locus</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4t64gn81h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6d56zx098</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:br86b406q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study involves the measurement of the neutron equivalent  dose ( NED) and the induced activity produced from medical linear accelerators.

However the details of fault geometry and where porosity  develops around faults remains poorly documented. Integration of 3-D seismic,  wireline and production data from Saybrook Field in northeastern Ohio has shown that  the productive trend is controlled by a 3.4mi (5.5 km) long, NW-SE oriented basement  fault that was probably reactivated during the Taconic Orogeny in the Mid- to Late  Ordovician. The far-field stresses of this compressional activity caused strike-slip  movement of the pre-existing fault to create echelon synthetic shear faults that  branch 1350ft (411.5m) upward into the Trenton-Black River interval. Circular  collapse structures between overlapping shear faults are the primary drilling  targets. Faults were mapped using amplitude and coherency versions of the seismic  data. Curvature analysis of horizons mapped in the seismic data allowed us to  further constrain the location and orientation of subtle structures. Fault  morphology provides insights into the path of the dolomitizing fluids. The  distribution of porosity, and thus the location of the reservoir, has been mapped in  3-D using a seismic attribute study that integrated wireline log-based measurements  of porosity with seismic attributes. Our results show that the best porosity is  developed in areas between overlapping synthetic shear faults. These locations  likely represent areas where antithetic shear faults formed, and when combined with  minor dip-slip movement created conduits for subsequent porosity generating fluids.

This has raised questions  over the source of the sediment (harvest parcels, roads, or stream banks) and its  potential impact on the sedimentology of the river. The objectives of this research  are twofold. The first is to ascertain if harvesting operations are associated to a  widening of low-order tributaries, creating a source of sediment. The second is to  determine if variations in the sedimentology along four segments of the Cascapedia  can be associated to harvesting operation intensity. Firstly, analysis of stream  width in low-order tributaries shows that, once the variations associated with basin  area and D50 are removed and within the range of harvesting in our dataset, there  appears to be a 25% increase in width associated with the harvesting activities of  the last five years, as well as with road density, both in a 60 m stream buffer for  a number of the sampled streams. Secondly, the models relating harvesting intensity  and changes in sedimentology are sensitive to a few sites or contrary to theory.  Future studies should determine the underlying hydrological processes responsible  for stream enlargement and the process of sediment deposition.</description><creator>Rousseau, Mélanie</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Logging -- Environmental aspects -- Québec (Province) -- Cascapédia River Watershed.</subject><subject>Sediment transport -- Québec (Province) -- Cascapédia River Watershed.</subject><subject>River channels -- Québec (Province) -- Cascapédia River Watershed.</subject><title>Multi-scale analysis of the effects of forestry operations on the stream morphology and sedimentology of the Cascapédia River, eastern Québec</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n583xv54c.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/765371816</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vq27zn99w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) catalyzes the  reduction of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, a substrate  for remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. Methionine is then converted to  S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the universal methyl donor. In the mouse, MTHFR levels  are highest in the testis and mice deficient for a targeted mutation in the Mthfr  gene are infertile. Analysis of prenatal gonocyte development provided evidence that  the defect in the Mthfr mouse testis occurs shortly after birth. The expression  profiles at the mRNA and protein levels suggest that Mthfr is expressed in the male  germ line and is developmentally regulated, with a possible role in meiosis.  Testicular phenotype was further characterized by altering the expression of this  enzyme in an Mthfr folate deficiency animal model. While postnatal folate deficiency  appears not to have adverse effects on spermatogenesis, it results in significantly  reduced sperm numbers in males from the developmental study, regardless of their  Mthfr genotype.</description><creator>Neaga, Oana-Raisa</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Biology, Genetics.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>Male germ cell development in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) mouse model</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1831ck53g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vq27zn99w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Human Genetics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hq37vp16k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Current mainstream software engineering methods do not consider  fault tolerance in the requirements engineering and analysis stage. If at all, they  only address it much later in the development cycle. However, most modern systems  can benefit from some form of fault-tolerance. Especially, complex, concurrent,  distributed, or heterogeneous applications are likely to contain software design  faults that can lead to system failures. In case of real-time or safety-critical  systems, such faults can also result in catastrophes. This thesis aims to investigate whether software development  approaches have integrated the concern of fault tolerance into the early software  development stages to satisfy dependability requirements. Software development  methods, frameworks, middleware, and other proposed approaches have been studied and  are discussed with particular focus on methodological support. Not surprisingly,  most approaches are specialized, targeting distributed, real-time, and embedded  systems. Finally, a comparison of the various approaches, based on several criteria,  is presented.</description><creator>Mustafiz, Sadaf</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Addressing fault tolerance in software development : a comparative study</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8g84mm836.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hq37vp16k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5h73pw64q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In positron emission mammography, the use of planar detector  limits the angular coverage and introduces more noise than conventional positron  emission tomography. We first studied the sampling artifacts introduced from the use  of discrete crystals. The images are reconstructed by back-projecting lines of  response from and to the centroid of interaction within the crystal. We postulate  that the sampling artifact should be reduced by allowing the lines of response to  shift away from the centroid towards the next most probable crystal  element. We then studied noise in the peripheral region of the images.  The solid angle function is an image uniformity correction function. The solid angle  function is the last thing applied before the images are displayed. We postulate  that image quality should improve by re-ordering the solid angle function and the  smoothing algorithm. These two techniques have shown an improvement in contrast,  resolution, and noise. An ROC curve analysis showed an improvement of 9.5 % in  accuracy.</description><creator>Hinse, Martin J.</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Biophysics, Medical.</subject><subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Radiology.</subject><title>Improving the spatial resolution and image noise in densily pixilated detectors for positron emission mammography</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/12579s794.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5h73pw64q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7p88ch08r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A key reason for malignant glioma recurrence after radical tumor  resection is the failure to control individual invading tumor cells that have moved  away from the primary tumor mass. The purpose of this study was to assess the role  of ROCK (Rho-kinase), a signaling protein in the Rho GTPase pathway, in malignant  glioma invasion in a three-dimensional model system. Primary glioblastoma (GBM)  explants or multicellular spheroids were implanted into a three-dimensional collagen  type I matrix. Individual tumor cells detached from the explants or spheroids and  invaded the matrix, or invaded human fetal astrocyte spheroids. Treatment of  implanted spheroids or explants with selective pharmacological inhibitors of ROCK  was found to significantly decrease invasion. Inhibition of ROCK did not affect  glioma cell or human astrocyte survival or proliferation. The identification of the  Rho/ROCK pathway as being important for glioma cell invasion might be of therapeutic  value in treating highly invasive glioblastoma.</description><creator>Hering, Ramm</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</subject><title>ROCK (Rho-kinase) protein inhibitors decrease malignant glioma invasion</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qj72p774h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7p88ch08r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:f1881m523</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The McGill Paleoclimate Model (MPM) was used to simulate the  past and future glacial inceptions. This model of intermediate complexity was first  run between 122 and 80 kyr BP (Before Present). After some parameter tuning, the MPM  simulated the last glacial inception at 119 kyr BP. The recent addition of a  vegetation component in the model led to an improvement of the results, especially  for the ice sheet distribution over Eurasia. The MPM was then run to simulate projections of the climate for  the next 100 kyr and possibly the next glacial inception. When forced by a constant  atmospheric CO2 concentration, the model predicted three possible evolutions for the  ice volume: an imminent glacial inception (low CO2 levels), a glacial inception in  50 kyr (intermediate CO2 levels) or no glacial inception during the next 100 kyr  (CO2 levels of 370 ppm and higher). This is mainly due to the exceptional  configuration of the future variations of the summer insolation at high northern  latitudes. The MPM also responded realistically to rapid CO2 changes. If a global  warming episode was included at the beginning of the 100-kyr run, the evolution of  the climate was slightly different and the threshold over which no glacial inception  occurred was lower (300 ppm).</description><creator>Cochelin, Anne-Sophie</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</subject><title>Simulation of glacial inceptions with the "green" McGill paleoclimate model</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gm80hv89q.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f1881m523</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x633f176v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis we study the theory of equations over a free  group.

In  particular, this study focused on the MC calculation of cutout factors for clinical  electron beams. A MC model for a Varian linac CL2300C/D was built and validated for  all electron energies and applicators. A MC user code for simulation of irregular  cutouts was then developed and validated. Supported by a home-developed graphical  user interface, it determines in situ cutout factors and depth dose curves for  arbitrarily shaped electron fields and collects phase space data. Overall, the  agreement between simulations and measurements was excellent for fields larger than  2 cm. The MC model was also used to calculate dose distributions with  the fast MC code XVMC in CT images of phantoms of clinical interest. These dose  distributions were compared to dose calculations performed by the pencil-beam  algorithm-based treatment planning system CadPlan and verified against measurements.  Good agreement between calculations and measurements was achieved with both systems  for phantoms containing 1-dimensional heterogeneities, provided a minimal quality of  the CT images. In phantoms with 3-dimensional heterogeneities however, CadPlan  appeared unable to predict the dose accurately, whereas MC provided with a more  satisfactory dose distribution, despite some local discrepancies.</description><creator>Albaret, Claude</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Biophysics, Medical.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Radiology.</subject><subject>Physics, Radiation.</subject><title>Automated system for Monte Carlo determination of cutout factors of arbitrarily shaped electron beams and experimental verification of Monte Carlo calculated dose distributions</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/00000061q.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2n49t252b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nk322d95s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:50:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Martin Streda is a one-act monodrama for baritone and an  ensemble of eight instrumentalists.

On the other hand,  not all transactions or businesses can be done solely through telecommunications, we  often need to get on an airplane and go somewhere else to do our respective  businesses and if we are on vacation we definitely need to travel. The problem is  that airplane travel, although fast, sometimes is not fast enough. Today's people  want convenience and when they want something they usually want it fast, especially  in business. Now, imagine yourself being able to get from Montreal to Sydney to  close a business deal and be back home the same day or ordering a part from Tokyo to  San Juan and have it delivered it the same day. It may seem like science fiction or  something too far ahead in the future, but it is not.

In their struggle to stay in the sky,  many airlines look for pro-active tools and fitting strategies. The primary focus of  this thesis is to discuss the unique characters of the airline business,  particularly, within the context of US bankruptcy reorganization law (Chapter 11).  After identifying primary competing interests in this perspective, the hypothesis  explored is that Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization provides a forum that may  uniquely address any of the specific needs of the different key players, if invoked  strategically. The corporate strategy of "facilitated survival" as  provided for within the context of US bankruptcy law is definitely worthwhile for  the airline industry to take note of.</description><creator>Van de Velden, Aster</creator><contributor>Janda, R.

This thesis  appreciates the injustices suffered by common-law spouses during and at the  termination of their spousal relationships, and reinforces the view that the denial  of marital property benefits dishonors the dignity of common-law spouses. Common-law  spouses experience similar needs as their married counterparts when the relationship  ends. Most of the current functions of marriage can be fulfilled within common-law  spousal relationships and should more appropriately be called functions of the  family. Both Canadian courts and the legislatures have acknowledged and  responded to the injustices that often flow from power imbalances in unmarried  persons' families and have thereby given increased recognition to common-law spousal  relationships. They have taken stock of the fact that by not recognizing the rights  of common-law spouses in Canada on the basis of their marital status is an affront  to justice. Legislatures have also enacted various statutes and have amended  existing ones to extend certain rights to common-law spouses. The various ways in which the rights of common-law spouses have  been recognized in Canada will be examined and discussed, in particular the remedial  notion of constructive trust which is imposed by courts to prevent injustice and  unjust enrichment. It is argued this notion of constructive trust has proven  effective, especially in cases where property is being divided after a long-term  intimate relationship. Common-law spouses have advanced constitutional challenges in  their quest to benefit from marital benefits and protections in their relationships  since it is argued that both relationships are functionally the  same. Finally, this thesis suggests lessons that can be learned from  the Canadian developments of recognizing common-law spouses. It also concludes by  examining similar developments that have taken place in other countries of Europe  and Africa.</description><creator>Mugisha, Julius P.

Governments must reevaluate the framework  regulating public utility sectors whenever rapid technological advancements occur.  This thesis argues that the antitrust authority better enforces competition rules,  and that the sector-specific authority better enforces technical and universal  service rules. The justification of the special competition rule concerning  bottleneck facilities access should be limited. As for the universal service scheme,  the enforcer should ensure competitive neutrality and adopt pro-competitive  instruments. This framework would allow for a more market-oriented and economy-wide  regulatory administration, as well as enforcement of the universal service scheme  based on a more accurate reflection of the fundamental values of  citizens.</description><creator>Oya, Kazuo</creator><contributor>Janda, Richard (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Antitrust law -- Australia</subject><subject>Competition -- Australia</subject><subject>Telecommunication -- Law and legislation -- Australia</subject><subject>Antitrust law -- United States</subject><subject>Competition -- United States</subject><subject>Telecommunication -- Law and legislation -- United States</subject><title>The relationship between competition law and telecommunications regulation : a comparative assessment</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h702q6977.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w3763743d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):35275</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
