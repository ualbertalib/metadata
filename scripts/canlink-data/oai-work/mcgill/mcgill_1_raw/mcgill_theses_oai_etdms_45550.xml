Located within the youngest part of the Blake River Group, this six km thick volcanic assemblage trends northwest, youngs northeast, and has increasing dip from $ sim$45$ sp circ$ in the west to subvertical in the east, with some folding within the sequence. Chemostratigraphic units were established using Zr/Y, La$ sb{ rm N}$/Yb$ sb{ rm N}$, and other immobile and incompatible HFSE ratios, and AFM and Miyashiro major element plots. Lithogeochemical technique based on the HFSE and other immobile and incompatible elements have been applied to both fresh and altered rocks; the trace element parameters are more specific than the major element discriminants. The stratigraphy along the D'Alembert-Clericy transect is subdivided into three major chemostratigraphic units: Lower Transitional Series, Middle Tholeiitic Series, and Upper Mixed Tholeiitic-Transitional Series. Overall, the lithologies comprise $ sim$65% tholeiitic and $ sim$35% transitional volcanics. The tholeiites are mainly represented by basalts and rhyolites, whereas the transitional rocks are mostly andesites and rhyolites. The geological, stratigraphic, and lithochemical attributes along the transect indicate the potential for massive sulfide deposits is comparable to that of the Central Mine Sequence. Although the thesis area contains a greater proportion of basalts and volcaniclastic material than the Central Mine Sequence, both areas contain major tholeiite basalt-rhyolite bimodal sequences, several thick felsic units, and andesite-rhyolite transitional suites.</description><creator>Pan, Jason J.</creator><contributor>MacLean, Wallace H.

The objectives of this experiment were to evaluate urea and TSP effects on nutrient availability to soybean (Glycine max L.). Field experiments were carried out on three Quebec soils; a Chicot sandy clay loam (Gleyed Melanic Brunisol), an Ormstown silty clay loam (Luvic Gleysol) and a Ste. Rosalie clay (Humic Gleysol). Three levels of TSP (0, 40, 80 kg $ rm P sb2O sb5 ha sp{-1}),$ and three levels of urea (0, 25, 50 kg N ha$ sp{-1})$ were incubated in the field and sampled at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks. Added TSP increased extractable P and decreased NO$ sb3$-N. Overall, alterations in nutrients other than N and P with added TSP or urea were not agronomically significant. There was increased concentration of N, P and Mo in soybean in some soils due to TSP application. Added urea increased Mg concentration in soybean. The concentration and uptake of Mo was positively correlated with soil extractable P and Mg. Consequently, application of TSP and urea together improved Mo uptake in the Chicot soil, while in slightly acid soils, Ormstown and Ste. Rosalie, TSP alone increased Mo uptake.</description><creator>Yusran, Fadly Hairannoor</creator><contributor>MacKenzie, A. F.

Woman-led families are impeded in their search for appropriate housing by their low wages and family responsibilities, compounded by the blindness of housing-policy makers to their existence. Historical models of collective dwellings are steeped in the ideology of the period and yield few direct practical solutions to the current dilemma. The richness of this housing, however, which evolved during a time of dramatic social change underscores the blandness of current housing solutions. Feminists insist that housing and urban design solutions should challenge the gender defined roles of "homemaker" and "childcare giver" and the restricted mobility of women in cities and suburbs. The endorsement of new housing typologies must be translated into their realisation and subsequent analysis.</description><creator>L'Heureux, Marie Alice</creator><contributor>Adams, Annmarie (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Women and city planning</subject><subject>Women -- Housing</subject><subject>Housing, Cooperative</subject><subject>Women -- Social conditions</subject><subject>Women heads of households</subject><title>The ideology of gender and community : housing the woman-led family</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s7526d202.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36tz379</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4t64gp090</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:37:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The nucleotide sequence of the cnjA cDNA (formerly pC1) from the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila was determined. This gene was previously found to be conjugation specific and to peak in expression just prior to or at pachytene in meiotic prophase I. The cnjA message is initiated from four transcription start sites, one minor and three major, and encodes a putative protein (CnjA) of 779 amino acids. The protein has a calculated molecular weight of 89.5 kDa and is mainly hydrophilic with an estimated pI of 9.3. CnjA was found to share no sequence similarities with any known protein to date. The gene's coding region demonstrates an unusual codon choice. Flanking regions of the cnjA genomic locus were amplified by means of the Inverse PCR method but attempts at subcloning and characterizing its promoter region were unsuccessful.</description><creator>Rosenauer, Angelika</creator><contributor>Martindale, Duane W.

The formulation of the post-capture dynamical equations of the system was carried out by writing the individual Lagrange's equation for the mother spacecraft, the two-link robotic manipulator, and the captured payload. These equations were then assembled to obtain the constrained dynamical equations of the system as a whole. This method, however, introduces the non-working constraint forces and moments which substantially complicate the dynamical analysis and therefore have to be eliminated. A novel technique that involves the use of the natural orthogonal complement of the velocity-constraint matrix was used in order to obtain a set of unconstrained independent equations. A computer code was written using FORTRAN and the IMSL subroutine DIVPAG was used to integrate the equations of motion. The pitch angle of the mother spacecraft, the joint angles of the manipulator, and their rates just after capture were calculated by solving the inverse kinematics problem and using impact dynamics principles. These were then used as initial conditions for the post-capture dynamics. A dynamical simulation of the system for the uncontrolled case was carried out to study the effect of the disturbance, resulting from the capture of the satellite, on the spacecraft/manipulator system. In light of the results corresponding to the uncontrolled system, a control algorithm, whose objective is to produce a set of feedback-linearized, homogeneous, and uncoupled equations, was designed and implemented. The effect of structural flexibility in the robot links on the response of the system was also investigated for both the uncontrolled and controlled cases.</description><creator>Jaar, Gilbert J.</creator><contributor>Misra, A.

Participants included 58 adolescents between the ages of 13 and 17 with groups approximately matched for age, IQ, and mental age. The maltreated group consisted of children who had been neglected, physically abused, and/or psychologically abused. Children in both maltreated and nonmaltreated groups were classified as acting-out or nonacting-out based on reports of truancy, substance abuse, disrespect for authority, violent outbursts, and trouble within the legal system. The primary findings of the study were that maltreated as compared to nonmaltreated individuals displayed lower real self-images and larger self-image disparities. However, the lowest real self-image scores were displayed by the acting-out adolescents regardless of their maltreatment status. In a comparison between the acting-out maltreated adolescents and the acting-out nonmaltreated adolescents, the real self-images were comparable, suggesting that the experience of maltreatment does not exacerbate the negative effect of behavioural difficulty. In addition, the acting-out maltreated children displayed higher ideal self-images than the acting-out nonmaltreated children. Both experiences of maltreatment and acting-out behaviours appear to be related to negative effects of self-image in adolescents. This highlights the importance of investigating the influence of experiential factors on self-system processing.</description><creator>Melrose, Regalena, 1970-</creator><contributor>Burack, Jacob (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Abused children.</subject><subject>Self-perception in adolescence.</subject><title>The self-image disparity of maltreated adolescents /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sb397914f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sq87bv415</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g445cf10p</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:37:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The process of remastering old recordings comprises two basic stages: the transfer of the material from the source to a modern format, and the subsequent restoration of the transferred material through various forms of signal processing. The transfer stage in particular requires an understanding of issues which are becoming increasingly less familiar to engineers as the science of recording progresses further into the digital era. To a lesser extent, the restoration stage involves the use of certain techniques and forms of processing which are specific to this application. This thesis is intended as a reference for those recording engineers who occasionally undertake remastering projects, but who are not thoroughly acquainted with the many different situations and problems which can be involved. Emphasis is given to those areas which are likely to be least familiar to most engineers. In order to enable the engineer to properly assess a given source, the evolution and characteristics of each type of source--cylinder, disc and tape--is surveyed. This is followed in each case by an examination of the preparation, equipment and method used in transferring the source. Finally, the various types of processing which can be applied to the transferred material are presented, focusing on the techniques and forms of signal processing which are specific to audio restoration.</description><creator>Rapley, Robert</creator><contributor>Woszczyk, Wieslaw (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Sound recordings -- Conservation and restoration</subject><subject>Signal processing</subject><subject>Sound -- Recording and reproducing</subject><title>The transfer and restoration of old recordings /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6395w818m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g445cf10p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Music</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:w9505134x</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:37:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The following thesis focuses on forms that traditional German grammar designates as "Pronominaladverbien." The objective was to establish the word class under which these forms-hereafter DWPs-should fall and their syntactic role. The thesis also aims at determining which translation procedures are used when translating German DWPs into French. As a first step, DWPs were integrated into a classification system that took into account both their proform character and their various syntactic roles. Organizing the DWP translations into a system proved to be somewhat arduous. After reviewing various translation theories, a conclusion became unavoidable: these systems do not accommodate all the characteristics of DWPs. A new classification system was devised. With the new system, it became possible to identify the most frequent translation procedures used for each DWP type and, at times, to explain their frequency. The conclusion of the thesis is that French manages in most cases to translate German DWPs without significant semantic loss.</description><creator>Morin, Hélène</creator><contributor>Sakayan, Dora (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>German language -- Grammar</subject><subject>German language -- Translating</subject><title>Formen der Kohäsion in deutschen philosophischen Texten und deren Übersetzungen ins FranzÜsische : zu den "Pronominaladverbien" vom Typ "darüber" und "worauf"</title><language>ger</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sq87bv40w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w9505134x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of German</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6q182m016</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:37:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this research, we review the Petri net formalism as well as the resolution methods involved in graphical simulation and performance analysis and introduce generic concepts that enable users to visualize the results of dynamic analysis through a consistent user interface. From the user's point of view, our goal is to facilitate the usage of dynamic analysis and ease the interpretability of its results. This is achieved by hiding complex dynamic analysis resolution methods behind an attractive user interface layer, while providing the user with full control over both the methods' execution and the display of their results. From the designer's point of view, we introduce generic visualization concepts that can be tailored to specific application domains. Our experience shows that dynamic analysis promotes system improvement by enriching the modelling activity and thus, we strongly believe in the benefits of its usage in software development. To promote this, we undertook the rationalization of the results produced by dynamic analysis and the elaboration generic concepts permitting their visualization.

Sexton's artistic direction underwent a sharp change midway into her poetic career after she wrote the volume Transformations, a collection of story-poems based on narratives from the Grimm fairy tales. In this collection, Sexton took on the external persona of a witch, and with her new voice, she was boldly able to re-tell her version of the Grimm tales. The new persona enabled Sexton to shed her previous voice of passivity, and instead criticize humanity by using satire and humor. Unfortunately, this movement in her work was an exercise in self-exploitation as the larger, cultural arena of Grimm put off any chance of working out her private problems. After Transformations Sexton had come to the realization of her self-exploitation and decided to even further separate herself from humanity by continuing to work with even more generalized, cultural forms--a movement that ultimately led her to mythologize her own death.</description><creator>Marusza, Julie A.</creator><contributor>Reichertz, R.

In particular, the study attempts a critical examination of Dewey's theory of Instrumentalism as a standpoint from which it continues to contribute to the retrogressive state of contemporary Japanese pedagogical orientation. In so doing, the thesis attempts to elicit, find speculative guidance in, and occasionally utilize in the clarification process, critical evaluations of Japan's university entrance examination system. The aspects of Dewey's theory which are considered as conducive to the above goal are: his approach to the relationship between educator and student, teaching techniques, and his research in the realm of education as it applies to meeting the needs of society. It is put forth that although Dewey's ideology in these areas has actually contributed to pedagogical dilemma which may impede the compulsory teaching of English conversation in Japanese high schools, such a contribution must be considered en route to reaching an accurate solution. It is contended that the cognitive-linguistic theory of Jerome Bruner is required as a viewpoint which serves to supplement, ameliorate and to assimilate Dewey's proposals in order to clearly elaborate a method by which Japanese adolescents may fluently express their hopes for participating in global ecology.</description><creator>Hersey, Stewart Matthew</creator><contributor>Nemiroff, Stanley (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>English language -- Study and teaching (Secondary) -- Japanese speakers</subject><title>From Dewey to Bruner : overcoming structural deficiencies in Japan's English language conversation programs for high school students :</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bz60cx193.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7s75dd208</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Religion and Philosophy in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:br86b425x</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:37:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study investigates the phenomenon of a communal Jewish organization, the National Budgeting Conference (NBC). In essence, the NBC is in charge of allocating money to national organizations through contributions collected from each local community. This unique arrangement doesn't exist in other Jewish communities around the globe; the common procedure is that every local federation allocates money for the local needs. The objective of this dissertation is to follow the activities of the NBC from a strategic management point of view. So far, almost the entire body of literature on Jewish organizations stem from a political science and an ethnicity point of view. My assumption is that by conducting the study from a management perspective, I have been able to research topics that usually do not receive a lot of attention in literature about Jewish organizations; some of these topics include whether and to what extent environmental elements in the community, as well as power relations, influence the decision-making process. I also focused on the NBC's structure, outcomes, and chances of survival. I concluded that the NBC operates within a very fluid and unstable environment, and as a result, it will have to monitor its interests carefully and adapt in a slow, incremental fashion if it wishes to increase its chances of survival.</description><creator>Zmiri, Ofer</creator><contributor>Weinfeld, Morton (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Nonprofit organizations -- Canada -- Management -- Case studies.</subject><subject>National Budgeting Conference (Canada) -- Management.</subject><subject>Strategic planning -- Canada -- Case studies.</subject><subject>Jews -- Canada -- Charities -- Management -- Case studies.</subject><title>Non profit organizations and strategic management : the National Budgeting Conference</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p8418p08h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/br86b425x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Sociology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sn009z71d</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:37:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A new approach to underground excavation design at INCO's Manitoba Division was undertaken by incorporating ground and support monitoring, and numerical modelling into an empirical framework. In the first phase of the study, a field measurement geomechanics guideline was developed for the Manitoba Division. Work in instrumentation led to the development of a new cable bolt monitoring device by INCO Ltd. and McGill University. This device has the ability to measure cable bolt performance reliably and at a low cost. As a result, a cost efficient and effective program is being implemented to monitor cable bolt layouts representatively. The second phase of the project utilizes the computational power of numerical modelling to aid mine design of stope backs. Results from numerical modelling, presented in the form of stress signatures, suggest that there might be a correlation between back surface stability and calculated values of major and minor principal stresses. By adding the tools of numerical modelling and instrumentation to traditional rock characterization data, a new data base for empirical modelling is established. The continual expansion of this database will lead to a more comprehensive approach to stope back design in the future.</description><creator>Ng, Philip</creator><contributor>Hassani, F. P.

Such distributions are connected with spatial scaling; they are now known to be generic features of multifractals, specifically connected with first order multifractal phase transitions. This behaviour has also been taken as the basic feature of self-organized criticality. Seismographs measure seismic wave magnitudes, seismic moments are then estimated by semi-empirical power law relations. We first show that the horizontal structure of earthquake seismic moment is in accord with our model of it as a space-time multifractal. Evidence is also presented that suggests it is a universal multifractal. An exponent $ eta$ which varies the relation between magnitude and moment is introduced and $q sb{D, eta}$, the Gutenberg-Richter exponent for $ eta$, is calculated. Related to $q sb{D, eta}$, is the effective dimension, $D sb{dressing}$ = 1.3 of the spatial averaging which was determined, along with $q sb{D, eta}$, using earthquake data from the South-Western United States.</description><creator>Hooge, Charles</creator><contributor>Lovejoy, Shaun (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Geophysics.</subject><title>Earthquakes as a space-time multifractal process</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rj4305605.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b5644s280</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6395w817b</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:37:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In response to the likely future change in the Canadian Guidelines regulating the maximum allowable concentration of trihalomethanes (THM) in potable water, an investigation into the possible causes and variability of THM precursors was conducted during the summers of 1990 and 1991 at Lake Memphremagog in south-eastern Quebec. A number of associated parameters were correlated with THM formation potential (THMFP) with respect to season, depth and position on the lake. The THMFP was quantified indirectly by measuring the THM concentration present after chlorination under standard conditions. THM concentrations in the samples were found to exceed the US EPA standard of 100 $ mu$g/L, sometimes considerably. There did not appear to be any statistically significant contribution to THMFP from human activity. No close agreement was observed between THMFP and any of the associated parameters for the lake as a whole. A few correlations were found between THMFP and nutrient concentrations at individual sites.</description><creator>Yang, Rachel</creator><contributor>Gehr, R.

The transient and sustained pathways are neuro-anatomical pathways which underlie low level visual processing. Dyslexics are hypothesized to suffer from a transient pathway deficit which manifests itself in reading difficulties. Normal and disabled adult readers were compared on two visual processing tasks. One task measured the contrast threshold of subjects for flickering sinewave gratings; normal and disabled readers did not differ in contrast sensitivity. On the second task--a visual search task--disabled readers were consistently slower than normal readers, rather than showing the pattern of performance predicted by the transient deficit model; the results provide little evidence for a transient pathway deficit. The results of this and related studies are discussed; it is concluded that empirical evidence for a transient pathway deficit in dyslexia is equivocal.</description><creator>Hayduk, Steven J.</creator><contributor>Bruck, M.

To do so, the author compares the performance realized by the Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and by the newly established Shanghai-Pudong New Area (1990). Although it benefits from the fourteen year old SEZs experience, it is argued, Pudong duplicates the flaws inherent to the SEZs and fails to offer advancement over their development. The author then suggests that China's initial objective to build a strong modern socialist country has apparently been gradually displaced by an evolutionary process of change similar to that in the Asian New Industrialized Countries (NICs), namely South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore.</description><creator>Canivet, Christophe</creator><contributor>Noumoff, Samuel J.

The equations of motion of an airfoil with two degrees of freedom, in pitch and plunge, are obtained. Then, the unsteady aerodynamic theories for different flow regimes are presented. The traditional solutions to the flutter problem, namely, the p-k and U-g methods, are formulated, and the Laplace transformation method for flutter analysis is also introduced. Then, the effect of different design parameters of an airfoil on the flutter speed is analyzed, both in the incompressible and transonic regimes. Furthermore, the effect of the relative values of the design parameters on the occurrence of flutter is investigated. Finally, some general conclusions regarding the above-mentioned phenomena are derived. The goal of this work is the fact that, the unsteady aerodynamic data has been used, both in the incompressible and transonic regimes, and, therefore, the obtained results are fairly precise.</description><creator>Akbari, Mohammad Hadi</creator><contributor>Price, S.
