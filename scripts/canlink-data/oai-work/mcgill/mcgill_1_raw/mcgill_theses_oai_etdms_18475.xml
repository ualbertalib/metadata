All the experiments performed in this study involve the use of frog’s skeletal muscle. However, because of the similarity of the actions of this alkaloid on nerve and muscle, much of the discussion and many of the references given will concern studies performed on nerve fiber preparations. About 10 years ago, an excellent review on the pharmacology of the veratrum alkaloids appeared (Krayer and Aches on, 1946).</description><creator>Frank, George. B.</creator><contributor>Burns, B.

Since conductivity results can be readily obtained to a high degree of accuracy over wide concentration and temperature ranges, the data provide a basis for developing and testing theories of electrolytes. The objective of such theories is to predict the behaviour of electrolytes from a knowledge of certain properties, such as the dielectric constant and viscosity for the solvent, and the ionic charges and radii for the solute.</description><creator>Elias, Lorne.</creator><contributor>Schiff, H.

The design of the tube was based on a similar structure that had been built to operate at a lower frequency. A series of experimental measurements were perfonned to determine the operating characteristics of the tube. A general theory previously developed for space-charge wave amplifiers was applied to the operation of the tube, in conjunction with approximations made to the theory of coupling to electron beams by means of helices. The experimental results obtained agreed reasonably well with those predicted by this theoretical development.

The study is based on field work carried out during the summers of 1954 and 1955 for the Quebec Department of Mines, and laboratory investigation at McGill University during 1955 and 1956. The abject of this paper is to prove that the rocks in that part of the "Labrador Trough” show progressive regional metamorphism towards the East and North.</description><creator>De Romer, Henry.

When neighbouring isotopes have similar disintegration periods, the assignment of observed radiations to a particular isotope is otherwise difficult. Accurate yield curves, or cross bombardment with different particles, can make assignments more probable. Careful "milking off" of daughter activities by chemical means may also be very helpful.</description><creator>Dandy, Gordon. T.</creator><contributor>Foster, J.

These advances have induced changes in the role concept of women, as perceived by society and by women themselves. Whereas women were formerly expected to limit their outlook to immediate family affairs, they are now encouraged to develop talents, express opinions and enter into planning and activities outside the home, often in occupations and fields conventionally dominated by men.</description><creator>Cumas, Steve.</creator><contributor>Younge, Eva.

According to this theory, many of the symptom expressions of parasitic diseases especially those occurring in the non-invaded parts of the host are due partly or entirely to those secretions of the pathogen formed while it is growing within the host.</description><creator>Coulombe, Louis-Joseph.</creator><contributor>Coulson, J.
