Gentzen to the accepted predicate and propositional calculus of logicians today. It will be proved that his formalization is equivalent to the so-called classical approach. The advantages of his system are that his formalization is closer to natural reasoning and that it affords a proof that indirect proofs may be eliminated in the predicate calculus.</description><creator>Hayes, James C.</creator><contributor>Rothberger and Lambek.

In recent years, certain thinkers have appeared, from among both the religious leaders and the Western educated intellectuals, who have endeavoured to satisfy that need.

Increased attention, however, has been given in recent years to types of behavior which cannot be explained solely in terms of such drives. A number or naturalistic and experimental studies has shown that exteroceptive stimuli may motivate an animal as persistently as any internal homeostatic stimuli. Tinbergen (1951), von Frisch (1950), Lorenz (1950), Thorpe (1944) brought evidence of exteroceptively elicited patterns of behavior from studies on lower animals.</description><creator>Havelka, Jaroslav.</creator><contributor>Thompson, W.

But for each writer, the word “society” has some particular meaning that is more precise than any general, all-inclusive definition. Society, for Jane Austen, meant the class-structure of her day and of her country. Nothing outside that concerned here as a novelist. The whole broad and varied expanse of eighteenth-century English life composed the society Henry Fielding depicted. Some novelists are interested primarily in a highly sophisticated and intellectual group of people, others in low life, and others still, in people of many social levels.</description><creator>Harvey, Mary.

In the study of respiratory mechanisms in the plant, three main experimental approaches have been employed. Two of these methods have this in common, that they both study the overall gas exchange in plant tissues. The first technique introduces a variable into the respiring system by altering the oxygen tension to which the living tissue is exposed. Different partial pressures of oxygen cause alterations in the respiratory rate of the tissue under investigation, and the interpretation of the results has led to the formulation of schemes of intermediary metabolism.</description><creator>Goodwin, Brian.

For us to comprehend this problem, they say that we must analyze and understand what this process of Westernization is and what it involves. This is true; yet there is a need for a clarification of terms and ideas before one proceeds with such a study. In the first place, what is meant by the term Westernization?</description><creator>Edmonds, William. A.</creator><contributor>Berkes, N.

G. Denton in 1947 which was found to produce in culture a potent toxin neutralizing substance. The mould was isolated as a contaminant from a Lowenstein's slope which had been inoculated with sputum tor the bacteriological diagnosis of tuberculosis. It was shown that the active toxin neutralizing principle was secreted into the medium during the growth of the mould in fluid cultures and that it may be demonstrated in mycelium free culture filtrates.</description><creator>Diena, Benito.

They may be annual or perennial and widely distributed within the families Crassulaceae, Cactaceae, Euphorbiaceae, and to a lesser extent in Asclepiadaceae, Begoniaceae, Liliaceae, and Compositae. They could be classified primarily as xerophytes, and accordingly are found naturally in the arid regions of the world, although ecological adaptation has increased their range considerably.</description><creator>Coles, Clifford.

V. V. Nicholls, the ultimate goal of which is the synthesis of several naturally-occurring oligopeptides with physiological activities. The purpose of the present work is to initiate an investigation of the problems associated with the synthesis of peptide bonds. Two aspects are under consideration here; first, to study the methods by which amine acids can be rendered monofunctional so that their reactions may be strictly controlled; second, to examine amidation reactions from the standpoint of the controlled synthesis of peptide bonds.</description><creator>Cipera, John.
