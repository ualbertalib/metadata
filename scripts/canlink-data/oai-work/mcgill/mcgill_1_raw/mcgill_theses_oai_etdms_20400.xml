Taurine is the predominant component of the free amino acid pool of vertebrate retinas. In the rabbit it is present at birth and increases four-fold by maturity reaching levels close to 50 mM in the adult. However, until the present studies its cellular localization was unknown. This study confirmed the postnatal (PN) increase in retinal taurine levels and examined PN changes in the immunocytochemical localization of retinal and optic nerve taurine. I have localized taurine immunoreactivity (taurine-IR) of developing and adult retinas and optic nerves using a highly specific antibody that was developed in our laboratory. My localization results indicate that the PN quadrupling of taurine content is due not only to photoreceptor cell development but also to the transient and/or stable expression of taurine-IR in other cell types as they differentiate. Particularly striking is the localization in horizontal cells where it is a candidate for a trophic factor in early PN synaptic organization, and in adult retinas as the yet unidentified inhibitory transmitter. The transient localization of taurine-IR in ganglion cell axons within the retina and optic nerve corresponds in timing to the "critical period" for the formation of retinogeniculate connections.

The IMT is determined in a single test and any phase transformations before the IMT will also be detected by the effects on the stress vs. strain behavior in the same experiment. This method also provides information about the effect of phase transformation and temperature on the mechanical behaviour of steel near the incipient melting temperature. By means of such tests, the incipient melting behaviour of a series of steels with carbon levels from 0.031 to 0.45 wt% was examined. For the steels containing 0.08-0.097%C and about 1.5%Mn, it was found that incipient melting occurs in the two phase ($ gamma$+$ delta$) region in the temperature range from 1470-1480$ sp circ$C, and is significantly influenced by microalloying elements. In the ultra-low carbon steel (0.031%C), the IMT is in the single phase $ delta$ region at 1495 $ sp circ$C, and for the medium carbon steels containing 0.3-0.42%C (hyper-peritectic) it is in the $ gamma$ single phase in the temperature range of 1401-1414$ sp circ$C. Comparison between the IMT obtained from CHF testing and the solidus temperature calculated from K-O model showed that these two values are extremely close. Since there is no nucleation barrier for melting, it seems that the CHF testing can delineate the solidus temperature in steel.

Three series of freezing column tests and two series of cyclic freeze-thaw experiments were performed with different liquid supplies: distilled water (pH = 5.8), a municipal waste leachate (pH = 6.9) and a leachate-heavy metal solution (pH = 2.5). Temperature distribution, water content, concentration of exchangeable cations and heavy metals in pore solution were determined in frozen soil as a function of time and space. The differential scanning calorimetry technique was used to calculate the quantity of unfrozen water in the frozen specimens. It was found that moisture intake and redistribution were closely related to the temperature gradient, the duration of freezing and the type of liquid used. The unfrozen water content, ionic concentration and temperature gradient were the controlling parameters contributing to contaminant transport in frozen soil. The distribution of exchangeable cations changed with the freezing time due to their migration and replaceability. The accumulation of heavy metals in the soil occurred as a result of cation exchange and precipitation mechanisms.</description><creator>Mazus, Miroslawa Teresa</creator><contributor>Mohamed, A. M.

This model is attractive becuase: (i) It has a simple interpretation; the impact of a variable upon survival is a constant and multiplicative effect on the hazard function. (ii) It facilitates the employment of the partial likelihood inference technique so that it requires no assumptions about the baseline distribution of survival times. Many numerical tests as well as graphical approaches have been proposed for assessing the adequacy of the proportional hazards model. However only a few authors have discussed strategies for modelling data for which the hazard ratio varies over time. In this thesis the topic of survival analysis is overviewed, and methods for assessing the validity of the proportional hazards assumption are reviewed. Finally a method of estimating the hazard ratio as a flexible function of time using the method of regression splines and the AIC model selection criterion is proposed. We report the results of a simulation meant to examine the small sample properties of this technique.</description><creator>Mackenzie, Todd</creator><contributor>Abrahamowicz, Michal (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Mathematics.</subject><title>Modelling a time-dependant hazard ratio with regression splines</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pz50gx01d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sf268600b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:tt44pn73b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis presents the design and implementation of a Vital Signs Monitoring System for a Patient Data Management System in an intensive care unit. The Vital Signs Monitoring System provides graphical display of patient data to assist medical decision making. It performs real-time patient data acquisition, and supports data management. Visual coding of information has been investigated to ensure effective graphical representation of patient data, to reduce screen clutter, and to enhance interpretability of graphical displays. A survey of existing patient monitoring systems, and patient data management systems is presented to give an overview of the recent advancements in these medical systems. Emphasis is placed on the design of the user interface. Important interface design considerations are discussed, and a survey of interactive hardware, interaction tasks, and dialog style is presented. The Vital Signs Monitoring System was developed in C language under the Presentation Manager window environment, and the operating system environment is OS/2 version 2.0.</description><creator>Yien, Chris Tak Ming</creator><contributor>Malowany, A.

The second one, FHS, uses the same combinatorial but considers the interactional term as a function of the molecular surfaces. The third one, MCS, changes the combinatorial with "s", the surface/volume ratio, keeping the interactional term as a function of the surfaces. These models are first tested with the classical system polystyrene-cyclohexane. The FHV model predicts good phase separation temperatures but gives wrong coexistence curve shape and critical compositions. For an infinite molecular weight, the critical conditions predicted by the FHS model differ from the ones predicted by Flory ($ rm T sb{c} = theta$ and $ rm x sb{2,c}$ = 0), if the ratio "s" of the polymer is smaller than 2/3 of the ratio "s" of the solvant as it is for this system. It is not consistent with experimental results. The coexistence curves calculated by the MCS model are in excellent accord with experimental results. Some calculations and experiments have also been made with oxaalcane + alcane and oxaalcane + siloxane series. FHV predicts good critical temperatures but bad critical compositions. For FHS, it is observed that if the polymer chain is larger than the solvent chain, the predicted critical temperatures are too low. This effect becomes negligible if the volumes of the components are similar. The MCS model seems the best one because it predicts acceptable critical conditions for most of the systems.</description><creator>Barbe, Nathalie</creator><contributor>Patterson, Donald (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Chemistry, Physical.</subject><title>Courbes de coexistence des systèmes polymère-solvant</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s7526d21b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1g05fc473</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:m900nv39w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The potential for an adaptive response to global climatic change was evaluated for an annual C$ sb3$ weed, Brassica juncea, by performing a selection on fecundity for eight generations.

I observed a genetic adaptation of early vegetative growth elevated CO$ sb2$ and temperature, which resulted in to 63% more biomass and 11% higher photosynthetic rates. Reproductive biomass, however, was decreased during the selection, mainly due to temperature stress, which disrupted flower development and induced strong maternal effects, counteracting the selection on fecundity.</description><creator>Tousignant, Denise</creator><contributor>Potvin, Catherine (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Plants -- Effect of atmospheric carbon dioxide on.</subject><subject>Brassica juncea</subject><subject>Plants -- Effect of temperature on.</subject><subject>Climatic changes -- Environmental aspects.</subject><title>Selection response to global change of Brassica juncea (L.) czern</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tq57nr80h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m900nv39w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cj82k8048</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The market becomes inefficient when externalities cause market failure. However, an externality does not entrain inefficiency if a market other than the one that generates it accounts for it in some way. Airports are a well-known source of the negative externality noise; and housing market are commonly thought to be affected by airport noise. A hedonic model was applied to airport noise and the housing market, together. It was found that the housing market of the West Island of Montreal did account implicitly for the noise annoyance from Dorval Airport, hence that the noise was a pecuniary externality. Moreover, each additional unit of noise annoyance (NEFdB) was found to cause an average depreciation in housing price (NDSI) of 0.76%. Finally, the linguistic predominance (French- or English-speaking) of a neighhourhood's residents may be an appropriate Canadian analogue for the racial variables that have been specified in some hedonic property models in the U.S.</description><creator>Tarassoff, Peter Stuart</creator><contributor>Thomassin, Paul J.

The test was repeated over three consecutive summers. Following a nitrogen mass balance analysis, for the manure stored in tanks of limited diameter but full depth, the slurries covered with the two depths of peat conserved 60% and 76% of their nitrogen, while that uncovered conserved only 54%. The sphagnum peat reduced manure evaporation during storage and helped conserve nitrogen during the tank mixing operation. A drying temperature of 105$ sp circ$C gave the sphagnum peat moss the most hydrophobicity to keep it floating over liquid manures. The sphagnum peat conserved nitrogen by absorbing the manure moisture rather than by fixing the volatilized ammonia. Applied to rye grass, the peat treated manure improved the nitrogen uptake efficiency by 140 190% and 190% to 340%, as opposed to untreated manure and chemical fertilizers, respectively.</description><creator>Garcia Moreno, Maria del Rosario</creator><contributor>Gehr, R.

Ethylene-glycol solvated samples indicated a two-component mixed-layer I/S system, whereas glycerol solvation suggested an additional high-charge expandable component. Exchange with octylammonium (n$ rm sb c$ = 8) and octadecylammonium (n$ rm sb c$ = 18) ions revealed the presence of five distinct types of layer structures: (1) low-charge smectite-group, (2) high-charge smectite-group or vermiculite, (3) double-layers or rectorite-like, (4) expandable illite, and (5) non-expandable illite. The presence and abundance of each type of layer structure changed with burial depth. A comparison of untreated and sodium hexametaphosphate-treated ${&lt;0.05} mu$m size fractions revealed modifications to the structure of mixed-layer I/S in both ethylene-glycol solvated and alkylammonium-ion exchanged specimens. Changes in peak position, intensity and breadths are apparent in XRD, and these modifications can also be observed in HRTEM. Lattice-fringe images revealed that pretreatment resulted in: (1) increased abundance of 2:1 layer silicate packets with expanded interlayers, (2) increased R1-ordered sequences, and (3) thinner packets of non-expanded illite interlayers. The use of sodium hexametaphosphate as a peptizer alters the interlayers and modifies the stacking arrangement of the layer structures. If the primary structure is altered, the disruption may be irreversible. It is evident therefore, that reliable ratio determination between expandable and non-expandable components in mixed-layer I/S is dependent on characterizing all the components and resolving the effects of chemical pretreatment.</description><creator>Sears, S.

Ensiled HMEC was evaluated for fermentation quality, silage microbiology, and aerobic stability. In control and inoculated ensiled HMEC, maximum pH reduction was observed within 7 d; such pH reduction was observed only after 21 d of ensiling with PA-treated HMEC. Irrespective of treatment, ammonia concentration increased with storage time. The lactic acid content increased up to 42 d of ensilage; between 138 d and 202 d of ensilage, there was a substantial reduction in lactic acid with all treatments. Throughout ensilage, there was no difference in water soluble carbohydrate (WSC) content between control and inoculated HMEC. Secondary fermentation was minimized by both inoculation and PA treatment. Regardless of treatment, the population of lactic acid bacteria increased within 7 d of ensilage and reached a maximum at 21 d of ensilage. Populations of yeasts and moulds decreased with fermentation time up to 42 d, then increased as the ensilage progressed. Bacterial inoculation increased aerobic stability of ensiled HMEC. PA was more effective than inoculation in reducing the disappearance of lactic acid and the rise in pH.

M. Hare's utilitarian one. It also looks at criticisms of both theories by David Wiggins. It concludes that his arguments against Hare are decisive because the moral theory that follows from Hare's version of the claim that moral judgements must be universalizable is incompatible with several basic requirements on moral theories. Wiggins' criticism of Kant, on the other hand, centres on a technical point that is overcome by an interpretation of Kant's tests for the universalizability of maxims that is given by Onora Nell. Finally the thesis argues that Kant's rational theory of ethics is superior to Wiggins' subjectivist claims because it both reflects our common sense conception of ethics and provides a rational basis for evaluating moral judgements.</description><creator>Ring, Marian-Ellen</creator><contributor>Davies, David (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Wiggins, David</subject><subject>Ethics, Modern</subject><subject>Hare, R.

The study attempts to describe the political journey of this party. It examines the position of the PPP in the political system of Indonesia's New Order as a whole. Immediately after the rise of the New Order government, a systematic program to restructure and simplify the political system was launched. It aimed, primarily, at national stability and the elimination of ideological politics. To the New Order government, an Islamic ideological orientation would only lead to conflicts among political forces and cause chaos, as experienced during the liberal democracy of the Old Order government. The emergence of the PPP being a consequence of the political restructuring launched by the government, the expectation was that it would be a good partner of the government. However, in the first five years of its existence, the PPP tended towards radical politics opposing the government on religious grounds. This opposition, which was again manifested towards the end of the 1970s, was seen by the government as an attempt by Islamic political groups to replace the Pancasila with Islam as the nation's ideology. Such a perception caused a lengthy internal conflict within the partial itself, particularly between the NU and MI, or between the idealist and realist groups. The internal situation of the PPP helped the government enforce the Pancasila as the sole foundation of all social and political parties. The significance of this thesis lies in the fact that no attempt has so far been made to study Islam and politics under the New Order government with a particular focus on the PPP.</description><creator>Hakim, Sudarnoto Abdul</creator><contributor>Turgay, Uner (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Partai Persatuan Pembangunan (Indonesia)</subject><subject>Islam and politics -- Indonesia</subject><title>The Partai Persatuan Pembangunan : the political journey of Islam under Indonesia's new order (1973-1987)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5m60qs88j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/12579t073</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Islamic Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:v118rf39t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Typical experiments investigating the accessibility and/or role of principles of Universal Grammar (UG) in adult second language acquisition (SLA) use a written grammaticality judgment (GJ) task to infer knowledge of principles of UG. The present investigation examined whether subjects would judge sentences differently in the aural modality than the visual. It was hypothesized that subjects in the aural condition would be less accurate and slower at judging sentences violating the subjacency principle than subjects in the visual condition. Four language groups were tested: ESL (English second-language) FSL (French second-language), L1.E (English first language) and L1.F (French first language). Subjects were assigned to either an aural or a visual condition; the same sentences were presented via computer. The target sentences presented to the subjects were declarative sentences involving embedded questions, as well as ungrammatical wh-questions which violated subjacency. The presentation times for all sentences were matched across conditions. Accuracy and reaction time to grammaticality judgment were measured. The hypothesis that subjects would be slower and less accurate in the aural condition than the visual one was supported. Furthermore, subjects were less accurate and slower to judge violations of subjacency than other sentences, in both modalities. The detrimental effects of the auditory task on judgments was most pronounced for the L2 learners. These results are discussed in the context of the informativeness and validity of outcomes derived from GJ tasks, and the ways in which they are presented.</description><creator>Murphy, Victoria A.</creator><contributor>Hoover, M.

They were also scored for which, and how many, elements were missing, distorted, displaced, and/or repeated. Contrary to previous findings, no main effects of side or lobe or side-by-lobe interactions were found on copy and recall scores obtained either before or after surgery, and all patients' recall improved equally from pre-operative to follow-up testing. Furthermore, patients' lesion site could not be predicted on the basis of any single measure or across all measures of performance. While group differences had been found on the previously assigned scores, the between-group overlap was almost complete and the original scoring was not done blindly. These results suggest that, despite previous claims, the Rey Complex Figure, a widely-used measure of non-verbal memory, is not an effective tool for localizing neural disturbance in temporal- and frontal-lobe epilepsy patients.</description><creator>Caramanos, Zografos</creator><contributor>Petrides, Michael (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Frontal lobotomy.</subject><subject>Temporal lobectomy.</subject><subject>Recollection (Psychology) -- Testing.</subject><subject>Form perception -- Testing.</subject><subject>Epileptics -- Psychological testing.</subject><title>Copy and recall of the Rey Complex figure before and after unilateral frontal- or temporal-lobe excision</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xk81jm25d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7s75dd19h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cn69m4994</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The captivity narratives have long been recognized as an important literary source. Most recently, scholars have viewed them in terms of their ethnographic value. Few, however, have considered them within the context of the history of New France. This study attempts to draw attention to the richness and diversity of these documents. The chapters, built upon the basis of similarities among the narratives, explore different facets of the French colony during the years 1744-1763. Specifically, they discuss techniques of military interrogation, the Quebec prison for captives (1745-1747), French-Indian relations and how the writers of these tales viewed both the war and their enemies.</description><creator>Gray, Colleen Allyn.</creator><contributor>Dechene, Louise (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Canada -- History -- To 1763 (New France)</subject><subject>Prisoners of war -- Great Britain</subject><subject>Prisoners of war -- Canada</subject><title>Captives in Canada, 1744-1763</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j67314755.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cn69m4994</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sf268601m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Computer programs were developed to perform creep tests on three microalloyed steels, with the aim of determining the precipitation kinetics of VN in austenite in one of the steels. This was a commercial 0.01% Ti- 0.12% V- 0.25% Mo steel. The other two were niobium steels with low (0.04% Nb) and high (0.07% Nb) niobium levels, respectively. The Ti-V-Mo steel was tested at various stresses between 30 and 50 MPa in the temperature range 850-900$ sp circ$C. A mathematical equation was fitted to the creep strain vs. time curves and the creep strain was expressed as a function of time. The strain rate was determined by differentiating the equation with respect to time and log(strain rate) vs. log(creep strain) or creep strain curves were then plotted for each testing condition. At 850$ sp circ$C and 900 seconds, the strain rate was observed to decrease at a faster rate. This time decreased to 700 seconds at 875$ sp circ$C at the same stress of 36MPa. This effect is attributed to the occurrence of VN precipitation in austenite, which reduces the creep rate. However, precipitation could not be detected by the creep technique at 900$ sp circ$C in this steel. The 0.07% Nb steel was tested at 950$ sp circ$C under stresses of 42 and 32 MPa. At 32MPa, the strain rate was found to decrease at a faster rate at 250 seconds. The 0.04% Nb steel was tested under stresses of 50 and 40 MPa at 875$ sp circ$C, and under 50 MPa at 850$ sp circ$C. In this steel too, a behaviour similar to that shown by the Ti-V and high Nb steels was observed at 375 seconds, 40MPa (875$ sp circ$C) and at 460 seconds, 50MPa (850$ sp circ$C). This is believed to be due the precipitation of NbCN.</description><creator>Rohatgi, Aashish</creator><contributor>Jonas, J. J.

In this thesis we study the literature of uncertainty in AI. The approaches taken by the researchers in this field can be classified into two categories: non-numeric approaches and numeric approaches. From non-numeric methods, we summarize The Theory of Endorsements, and non-monotonic logics. From numeric methods, we elaborate on MYCIN certainty Factors, Dempster-Shafer Theory, Fuzzy Logic, and Probabilistic Approach. We point out that probability theory is an adequate approach if we interpret probability values as beliefs and not only as frequencies. We first discuss broad and more thoroughly researched areas. We then focus more on integrating probability and logic as we believe this is a crucial approach to build up a setting for reasoning with uncertain information based on strong local foundations. Some key works in that area are traced back to 1913 when Lukasiewics published his paper on Logical Foundation of Probability. Comparisons between Nilsson's probabilistic logic and the related work of Quinlan, Grosof, McLeish, Chen, and Bacchus are given. We conclude the thesis by our remarks and suggestions for possible future research topics.</description><creator>AlDrobi, Molham Rateb</creator><contributor>Paige, Chris (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Artificial Intelligence.</subject><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Final version : uncertainty in artificial intelligence</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w66344570.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gt54kp01j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fx719n183</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Commercial food proteins were used in order to study the relationship between hydrophobicity and two functional properties: emulsification and foaming. Hydrophobicity determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) binding method and the cis-parinaric acid (CPA) fluorescence probe method gave poor statistical correlation with foaming and emulsification. The SDS binding method gave higher hydrophobicity and higher correlation values with foaming and emulsifying, than the fluorescence probe CPA method. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to study the secondary structures, of the commercial food proteins. Infrared spectra of the protein samples with or without denaturing agents (SDS, urea, and guanidine) in the region of the amide I and II bands were determined in deuterium oxide (D$ sb{2}$O) buffer. Fourier self-deconvolution was used to study infrared band positions. BSA was an $ alpha$-helix protein, and in the presence of SDS, due to protein unfolding, exhibited a random coil structure. By correlating their infrared spectra to predetermined peak positions in the protein samples, it was shown that the legume proteins contained $ beta$-structure, and as SDS was added, exhibited non-ordered structures. The spectra of gluten samples were obtained only in the presence of SDS, showing either random coil, or non-ordered structures.</description><creator>Arbabzadeh, Sima-Dokht</creator><contributor>Alli, I.

My aim is modest. It is not to present an argument for either the realist or the anti-realist position but rather to show where the debate stands once we have considered recent arguments by Laymon and Cartwright which have made use of the notion of idealization assumptions. My intent is to point out the difficulties of Laymon's argument for realism in the hope of showing what must be accomplished in providing a more convincing argument for realism. I will also suggest that although Laymon's proposal is problematic, it still poses a serious problem for van Fraassen's form of anti-realism, constructive empiricism.</description><creator>Eng, David, 1966-</creator><contributor>Pietroski, Paul (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Science -- Philosophy</subject><subject>Physics -- Philosophy</subject><subject>Realism</subject><title>The role of idealizations in the realism/anti-realism debate /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rx913q76w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nv9353847</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Philosophy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2j62s567f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:43:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Plant growth regulators and nitrogen fertilization have been associated with the increased incidence of fusarium head blight, a destructive disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). In Canada, the major causal organism of this disease is Fusarium graminearum Schwabe, the conidial state of Gibberella zeae (Schw.) Petch. Most studies concerning the effect of plant growth regulators on fusarium head blight were conducted in fields with natural infection. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of growth regulators and nitrogen fertilizer on the incidence of fusarium head blight of wheat with artificial inoculations. A survey conducted in a field trial testing the effect of the plant growth regulator Cerone on the yield components of several cultivars of spring wheat showed that Cerone treatments increased Fusarium infection only in cultivar Columbus. Further research was conducted using cultivar Max, a cultivar susceptible to fusarium head blight, which is widely grown in Quebec. In controlled-condition greenhouse trials, the growth regulators Cycocel and Cerone, as well as nitrogen fertilization did not influence the disease progress. In the 1991 field experiment, the highest incidence of seed infection was observed in Cycocel treatments when the macroconidia of F. graminearum were directly applied to the heads, but not significantly different from the non-treated control. None of the nitrogen levels affect the incidence of seed infection. In the 1992 field trial, the plots were treated with macroconidia of F. graminearum applied to the heads or with Fusarium-colonized corn applied to the rows. Both Cycocel and Cerone significantly increased the incidence of spikelet only in the colonized corn treatments. Cycocel also increased the incidence of seed infection, but only in colonized corn treatments. Cycocel also increased the incidence of seed infection in the non-inoculated treatments. Growth regulators had no effect on the disease when heads were inoculated directly with macroconidia.</description><creator>Fauzi, Mohamad Taufik</creator><contributor>Paulitz, T. C.

It was found that subsurface irrigation could be practised successfully in some clay soils of Quebec. The 10 m drain spacing was found to be better than the 20 m drain spacing in terms of keeping a uniform water table between the drains. The water table distribution between the drains was found to be a factor of the applied hydraulic head. The relationship between the applied hydraulic head and the midspan water table elevation could not be determined due to unfavourable weather conditions during the study period. The soil moisture content was found to follow the same behavior as the water table elevation, however, the relationship between these two parameters could not be properly established. It was also found that under the same applied hydraulic head, the drain spacing did not affect the soil moisture distribution. Subsurface irrigated plots were found to make better use of rain water than drained only plots since they did not permit the formation of well-defined pathways (macropores) allowing rainfall to move below the root zone without wetting it. It was also found that subsurface irrigation did not alter the soil structure appreciably and that autumn drainability was not affected in 1990 and 1991.</description><creator>Plante, André</creator><contributor>Prasher, S.

Two growing seasons of data were collected on a loamy sand soil near Sorel, Quebec and one year of data on a clay soil to the south-west of Montreal. Several water table management schemes were investigated, ranging from conventional subsurface drainage to automated subsurface irrigation. DRAINMOD was used to simulate the measured water table fluctuations and relative corn crop yields over the growing season. Verification of the model was needed to determine if it could be a useful tool in the design and operation of water table management systems for the Quebec region. It was found that DRAINMOD output closely simulated the water table fluctuations for conventional drainage and subsurface irrigation plots provided no exceptional circumstances existed. More study is needed in some areas such as bedded fields and in the use of fluctuating water level control structures.</description><creator>MacKenzie, Raymond Wilbert</creator><contributor>Prasher, Shiv (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1992</date><subject>Subsurface drainage -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Corn -- Irrigation -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Subirrigation -- Québec (Province).</subject><title>Field verification of DRAINMOD for the Quebec region</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wm117p77b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cr56n200x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Agricultural Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):20425</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
