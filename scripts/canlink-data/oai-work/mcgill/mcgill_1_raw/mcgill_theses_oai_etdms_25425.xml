of, and during the civil war, and discusses the causes and effects of the conflict in the Gloucestershire context. Chapter One describes the county in 1640, studying its physical features, wealth and pursuits and social structure. The second chapter offers a survey of the 'county community,' the prominent county families who formed a small but most powerful and influential group in the county. Chapter Three attempts to classify the established county gentry in terms of landed income and to consider how far it is possible to describe the class as 'rising' during the early seventeenth century. The fourth chapter covers the personal lives of the resident peers and major gentry, considering the strength and impact of kinship and marriage bonds among the leading families. Chapter Five considers the role of the gentry is governors of the shire. The sixth chapter traces the development of opposition in the county to the policies of the Caroline government. Chapter Seven presents a narrative of 1640-42. The next chapter suggests that, at the beginning of the civil war, the elite gentry families began losing their predominance in county affairs due to external commitments and divisions among them. The ninth chapter describes military rule in Gloucestershire between 1642 and 1646. Finally, the last chapter assesses some of the effects of civil war.</description><creator>Zweigman, Leslie Jeffrey</creator><date>1987</date><subject>Gloucestershire (England) -- Politics and

Despite high demand for this crop, asparagus production is  declining because of asparagus root rot disease that is caused by Fusarium spp.  Phosphorus is one of the most important nutrients for the production of healthy  asparagus roots that may resist infection by Fusarium. The objective of this study  was to determine the effects of phosphorus (P) applications on asparagus yield and  soil microbial parameters. Plots receiving 0 to 200% of the P recommendation, based  on the Centre de reference en agriculture et agroalimentaire du Quebec (CRAAQ)  guidelines, did not differ significantly (p &lt; 0.05) in first year yield or  plant tissue concentrations. However, asparagus receiving no fertilizer had 2 to 3  times higher arbuscular mycorrhizal colonisation of roots than other treatments in  May 2003. Fresh marketable yield was negatively correlated to Fusarium incidence (p  = 0.0091 r = -0.51) suggesting that plants with higher yields are less susceptible  to Fusarium symptoms and that producers should avoid over-harvesting low yielding  plants to reduce Fusarium spread in the field. Soil microbial activity was not  affected consistently by P fertilizers because of high variability in the  field.</description><creator>Sommerville, David W.</creator><contributor>Whalen, Joann K.

Biogeographic patterns of LMA freshwater fish communities at the spatial extent of  LMA indicate that biological differences among species as well as regional and  historical processes are quintessential to explaining the patters of turnover of  community composition and species richness across the LMA Isthmus. The study of LMA  freshwater fishes permits the inference that ecological interactions among species  are not independent of a region's history, suggesting that regional and historical  processes probably play an ongoing role in the maintenance of LMA freshwater fish  communities. In addition, the study of the natural experiment of the Panama Canal  provides a clear demonstration that dispersal, rather than local deterministic  processes such as competition and predation, previously set the upper limit of the  number of fish species coexisting in local communities. Comparisons of species  inventories established prior to Canal construction with contemporary species lists  demonstrates a large net increase in species richness of local communities,  suggesting that the local communities of the Panama Canal watershed were not  saturated.</description><creator>Smith, Scott A., 1978-</creator><contributor>Bell, Graham (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Bermingham, Eldredge (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2004</date><subject>Fish communities -- Costa Rica.</subject><subject>Freshwater fishes -- Costa Rica.</subject><subject>Freshwater fishes -- Panama.</subject><subject>Fish communities -- Panama.</subject><title>The importance of regional and historical processes in the assembly and maintenance of lower Mesoamerican freshwater fish communities /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tx31qj27g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w6634429t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:b8515n990</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:15:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Prostaglandins (PGs) are lipid mediators derived from a cascade  initiated by catalyzing arachidonic acid to PGH2 via the cyclooxygenases (COXs).  Subsequently, downstream prostanoid synthases convert PGH2 into the biologically  active PGs, which are potent mediators of pain and inflammation. Membrane  prostaglandin E2 synthase-1 (mPGES-1) is a terminal prostaglandin synthase that  isomerizes PGH2 into PGE2. Studies have shown that COX-2 and mPGES-1 are induced  following pro-inflammatory stimuli in cell lines and tissues. The focus of this  thesis was to better understand the role of mPGES-1 in inflammation, using rat  adjuvant-induced arthritis as a model. Our study showed that mPGES-1 followed a  similar induction profile as COX-2 by RNA and protein analysis, implying that  mPGES-1 is the major terminal PGES enzyme downstream of COX-2 that plays a role in  the inflamed rat paws. Immunofluorescence studies also revealed the induction of  mPGES-1 along with COX-2, 3 days post-adjuvant treatment. These findings suggest  that mPGES-1 may constitute a target for the treatment joint  inflammation.</description><creator>Sirinyan, Mirna</creator><contributor>Mancini, Joseph A.

Experimental treatments were a control diet  with no added sunflower seed, a raw sunflower seed diet and a roasted sunflower seed  diet. Sunflower seed diets contained 6% fat whereas the control diet contained 3%  fat. In study one, two ruminally fistulated cows were used in a randomized complete  block design to determine the effects of roasting on ruminal degradation of  sunflower seeds. In the second study, three ruminally cannulated lactating Holstein  cows were used in a 3 x 3 Latin square experiment to determine the effects of  dietary treatments on ruminal fermentation and total tract nutrient utilization. In  the last study, three primiparous and six multiparous Holstein cows were used in  three 3 x 3 Latin squares to determine the effects of dietary treatments on milk  yield and composition.</description><creator>Sarrazin, Pascale.</creator><contributor>Mustafa, A.

MNE distinguish themselves from national businesses in the sense  that they continue to be governed, in their relationship with their employees, by  the national law where they operate. This contradictory dualism is the source of  great tensions and uncertainties with regard to the future of national and  international labour law standards. In a first part of this thesis, we study the  International Labour Organization (ILO), which is the international body competent  to adopt international standards and apply them. In the second part, we examine the  phenomenon of national labour laws extraterritoriality and its manifestation in some  jurisdictions. Finally, we explore the justifications put forward for the  extraterritorial application of national laws, in particular when these national  laws incorporate "fundamental" international labour  standards.</description><creator>Beaumier, Jean-Fran√ßois</creator><contributor>Blackett, Adelle (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Conflict of laws -- Labor laws and legislation</subject><subject>International business enterprises</subject><subject>Labor laws and legislation, International</subject><title>L'application extraterritoriale des lois nationales incorporant des normes internationales du travail</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/td96k320f.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zs25x919p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mp48sd31z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:15:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>An in-depth study of Advance Passenger Information and Passenger  Name Record has never been accomplished prior to the events of September 11 th. It  is of great importance to distinguish both of these concepts as they entail  different legal consequence. API is to be understood as a data transmission that  Border Control Authorities possess in advance in order to facilitate the movements  of passengers. It is furthermore imperative that harmonization and inter-operability  between States be achieved in order for this system to work. Although the  obligations seem to appear for air carriers to be extraneous, the positive impact is  greater than the downfalls. Passenger Name Record access permits authorities to have  additional data that could identify individuals requiring more questioning prior to  border control clearance. This data does not cause in itself privacy issues other  than perhaps the potential retention and manipulation of information that Border  Control Authorities may acquire. In essence, bilateral agreements between  governments should be sought in order to protect national  legislation. The common goal of the airline industry is to ensure safe and  efficient air transport. API and PNR should be viewed as formalities that can  facilitate border control clearance and prevent the entrance of potentially  high-risk individuals.</description><creator>Banerjea-Brodeur, Nicolas Paul</creator><contributor>Milde, Michael (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Data protection -- Law and legislation</subject><subject>Airline passenger security screening</subject><subject>Biometric identification</subject><subject>Privacy, Right of</subject><title>Advance passenger information passenger name record : privacy rights and security awareness</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fx719m98t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mp48sd31z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k0698810q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:15:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The 'Arco Seco' or 'Dry Arc' region of the Republic of Panama is  considered to be the driest in the country, where many areas of this region  experience severe water stress during the months of January through May. This study  was conducted to develop a tool for the assessment of sustainable implementation of  water harvesting through ponds for agricultural purposes in the region. A computer  based Decision Support System (DSS) has been developed specifically for the Arco  Seco region in order to facilitate pond storage capacity estimation. As part of the  DSS, four computer programs have been designed for four different case scenarios;  the first one is for sites that have high water demand and no topographical  restrictions for pond size; the second is for fairly high water demand, no  topographical restrictions for pond size, and for farmers who wish to have a backup  of water to use mostly during drier years; the third is for low water demand, usage  during the dry season only, and topographical restrictions for pond size, and  finally the fourth is for constant water demand throughout the year, and for sites  where runoff is the only water source.* *This dissertation is a compound document (contains both a paper  copy and a CD as part of the dissertation).</description><creator>Desrochers, Anne</creator><contributor>Bonnell, Robert (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2004</date><subject>Farm ponds -- Panama.</subject><subject>Water harvesting -- Panama.</subject><subject>Water -- Storage -- Panama -- Decision making.</subject><subject>Decision support systems -- Panama.</subject><title>Water harvesting through ponds in the Arco Seco region of the Republic of Panama : decision support system for pond storage capacity estimation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xg94hq23m.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k0698810q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Bioresource Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0p096768r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:15:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Immediately after its appearance in 1999, Web Services has  become the hottest topic in the information technology industry. Web Services was  primarily fostered by the exponentially growing demand for highly efficient  Business-to-Business (B2B) solutions. Web Services is a highly modularized application level  framework. Its fundamental idea is to enable Web applications to interact with each  other regardless of platforms, languages or network infrastructure used. This  understanding has been accepted and shared by current Web Services vendors, users,  professionals and standards organizations. Meanwhile, Web Services concepts,  architecture, components, working models and direction are still under debate. This  thesis provides an introduction to these topics based on a thorough research across  existing materials. The first part of this thesis clarifies the architecture and  basic concepts of Web Services. The second part provides a complete introduction and  analysis of the two groups of technologies stated above, and shows how these  technologies work together. The third part of this thesis presents a discussion of  the advantages and potential applications of Web Services. It is based on the  perspectives of a variety of technical experts and solution designers.

It shows the highest identities with mammalian  PRMT4/CARM1 (Protein Arginine  MethylTransferase 4) (59% identity, 75% similarity).  HPLC analysis demonstrated that DRMT4 belongs to the type I class of  methyltransferases (Boulanger et al. 2004), meaning that DRMT4 catalyzes  asymmetrical dimethylarginine formation. A polyclonal antibody against DRMT4 was  generated and used to study DRMT4 expression using western blots and  immunostainings. In order to study DRMT4 function in Drosophila using genetic  methods, we created three kinds of DRMT4 transgenes: a genomic DRMT4 under its own  control, a genomic DRMT4-GFP fusion gene and a cDNA DRMT4 under UAS control. We  investigated DRMT4 localization in wild type flies using the DRMT4-GFP transgenic  line and immunostaining.</description><creator>Zhang, Li</creator><contributor>Suter, Beat (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2004</date><subject>Oogenesis.</subject><subject>Drosophila -- Molecular genetics.</subject><subject>Methyltransferases.</subject><title>DRMT4 (Drosophila arginine methyltransferase 4) : functions in Drosophila oogenesis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gh93h008n.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f1881m53c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9593tv63k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:15:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In accordance with the two-signal model, optimal T cell  activation can only occur in the presence of a primary antigen specific signal,  provided by the T cell receptor, and a second co-stimulatory signal. The most potent  co-stimulatory molecules identified to date are the CD28/CTLA-4 receptors with their  CD80/CD86 ligands, found on T cells and antigen presenting cells (APC) respectively.  Many studies have implicated the V-domain of CD80 and CD86 to be responsible for the  direct interaction with CD28/CTLA-4. Conversely, few studies have shown that the  C-domain CD80 is crucial for the interaction and ultimate suppression of T cell  activation and proliferation by binding to CTLA4. The thesis herein identifies amino  acids located in the C-domain of CD80 that proves critical for the binding of  CTLA-4. This particular mutant, N5-6, exhibits a preferential binding to CTLA-4. We  observe 7-fold enhanced binding to CTLA-4 while maintaining its conventional binding  to CD28. Functionally, this mutant is still capable of activating T cells via CD28.  Interestingly, binding to CD28 is not inhibited by the presence of soluble CTLA-4 as  a competitive inhibitor despite its greater affinity. As a DNA vaccine, this mutant,  along with other mutants exhibiting differential binding to CD28/CTLA-4, can be used  as a means modulate T cell responses. This can provide a therapeutic approach to the  treatment of autoimmunity or aid in the eradication of reservoir cells in HIV and  HSV infections.</description><creator>Saba, Nicole</creator><contributor>Sekaly, Rafick-Pierre (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><title>Effects of modified CD80 on the co-stimulation of T cell</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4x51hj686.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9593tv63k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mw22v600f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:15:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The tumor suppressor gene RB regulates cell proliferation at the  G1/S transition of the cell cycle. The retinoblastoma protein pRB associates with  both HDAC-dependent and independent mechanisms to actively repress E2F-dependent  genes required for entry into S phase. The retinoblastoma binding protein 1 RBP1  recruits the mSin3A/HDAC1 co-repressor complex to the pocket of pRB at growth arrest  and accounts for the majority of the HDAC activity associated with pRB. However,  transcriptional repression by RBP1 also involves HDAC-independent activities because  repression is only partially relieved by the HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A. This  activity is mediated in part by residues 241 to 452 of RBP1 designated as the R1  domain. Hypermapping studies on the previously defined R1 domain of RBP1 revealed  that amino acids 400 to 452 of RB1 are sufficient to mediate HDAC-independent  repression. Inspection of the minimal R1 region located two copies of the SUMO  consensus motif Psi-K-X-E and subsequent experiments demonstrated that the R1 domain  is post-translationally modified by SUMO on lysine 418 and 444. In addition,  transcriptional repression by the R1 domain was abrogated by either mutagenesis of  both SUMO acceptor lysines or in the presence of a SUMO specific protease implying  that SUMO modification modulates HDAC-independent transcriptional repression by  RBP1.</description><creator>Roy, Jean-S√©bastien</creator><contributor>Branton, Philip E.

This work is based on an observation that  not all the information contained within an image is used by the human brain.  Previous works demonstrate methods for reconstructing images adequately using edge  information. We exploit the fact that some components of the image can be removed  while having little effect on human perception: this is the key basis for the  compression developed in this thesis. We first construct compression preserving all  the edge information extracted from the image. We then consider the impact of  removing some of the edge information to further improve the compression ratio. We  direct our attention to two types of information associated with edges: (1) its  location and shape, (2) intensity and blur values on each side of the edge. First we  propose a method to encode edge location and shape in a most efficient manner. We  propose a measure of redundancy to remove edges carrying information already encoded  in neighboring edges. Then we consider the compression of intensities and blur  associated with each edge. Since the intensity information is quite noisy we show  that we can remove the noise and reduce intensity functions to linear functions  without significant impact on the quality of a reconstructed image. Finally we  introduce a method to encode pattern information not included in edge information to  improve the overall quality of the reconstructed image.</description><creator>Kowalewski, Damian</creator><contributor>Dudek, Gregory (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2004</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Edge-based encoding of gray-scale images</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/70795830f.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gx41mj654</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cf95jb983</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:15:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Heme oxygenase-1 is a 32 kDa protein that catalyzes the  degradation of heme to biliverdin in brain and other tissues. Our laboratory had  previously reported significantly decreased HO-1 protein levels in AD plasma and CSF  and HO-1 mRNA in AD mononuclear cells (which may be chemically unstable relative to  the levels seen in normal elderly control (NEC) subjects). We hypothesized that  there exists a heme oxygenase-1 suppressor (HOS) factor in the plasma of AD  patients. Using a novel, glial-based bioassay, we showed that plasma HOS activity  was detected in 23/24 AD patients, 3/8 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and  in 0/21 NEC patients (HOS activity signifying HO-1 suppression of &gt;50% compared  to positive controls). Antioxidant exposure and hypercortisolemia did not account  for the HOS activity in AD plasma. We investigated the specificity and selectivity  of the HOS factor by analyzing plasma derived from patients with non-Alzheimer's  dementia's and non-dementing neurological disorders. We conclude that a HOS factor  exists in the plasma of sporadic AD and some MCI patients but is undetectable in NEC  plasma. The presence of a circulating HOS factor may further signify systemic redox  derangements in early sporadic AD and provide a possible biological marker for this  condition.</description><creator>Kravitz, Steven</creator><contributor>Schipper, Hyman M.

It was hypothesised that the response  to PS would differ between both groups due to different lipid metabolism. During  this randomised, double blind, crossover trial, participants consumed a controlled  diet with placebo or PS for 21 days. Plasma total cholesterol (TC) decreased with placebo and PS  (10.9% and 9.7% in non-diabetic versus 11.6% and 13.6% in diabetic participants, p  &lt; 0.05). Plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) significantly  decreased with PS in both groups. The reduction in LDL with PS was greater in  diabetic compared to non-diabetic individuals (29.8% versus 14.9%, p &lt; 0.05).  Cholesterol absorption decreased on average (p = 0.06) by 26.5% with PS compared  with placebo in the diabetic group only. Therefore, a controlled heart healthy diet  reduced TC and LDL concentrations in non-diabetic and diabetic individuals. Adding  PS as adjuncts to a hypocholesterolemic dietary treatment was associated with lower  LDL concentrations and cholesterol absorption in hypercholesterolemic participants  with type 2 diabetes.</description><creator>Journoud, M√©lanie</creator><contributor>Jones, Peter J.
