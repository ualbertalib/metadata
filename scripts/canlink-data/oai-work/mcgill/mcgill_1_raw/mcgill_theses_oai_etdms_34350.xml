The novelty was the result of the method used for silica decomposition which consisted of transferring an arc (Ar or Ar/H2) to a silica anode. The primary objective was to examine the effect of current (150--250 A), plasma gas flow rate (10--20 lpm Ar) and plasma gas composition (0--2.8% H2) on the rate of silica decomposition. The decomposition rate (0.09--1.8 g/min) was determined to be a heat transfer limited process which occurred below the arc root where the surface had attained its boiling point. The decomposition rate was not affected by plasma gas flow rate since convective heat transfer was reduced by the counter flow of decomposition products (SiO(g) and O2) from the anode surface. Increasing current increased the decomposition rate because the heat input to the anode due to electron flow and arc radiation was increased. Adding H2 to the plasma gas increased the decomposition rate because of an increase in radiative heat transfer to the anode, a reduction in the theoretical energy requirement for decomposition and a consumption of O2 which lowered the boiling point. A mathematical model was developed to simulate the behavior of the silica anode. The predicted decomposition rates were of the same order of magnitude as those observed experimentally. A secondary objective was to examine the effect of oxidation zone parameters including SiO(g) concentration (0.09--3.24%) and temperature (1414--1801 K) of the reactor exit gas and steam flow rate (46--71 g/min) on powder properties. The oxidation zone was where SiO(g) was quenched with steam to generate fumed silica. The specific surface area of the powders (104--257 m2/g) increased with increasing steam flow rate due to the higher quench rates. The high H2O (g) concentration in the oxidation zone produced surface hydroxyl densities which approached saturation (7.85 Si-OH/nm2). The powders had typical characteristics associated with</description><creator>Addona, Tony.</creator><contributor>Proulx, P. (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Munz, R. J.

A mail questionnaire queried 963 Canadian and American participants, aged 45 to 92 years, who had enrolled in a fall 1997 Elderhostel Canada program, but not yet attended. The number of useable surveys was 811, representing an 84.2% rate of return. The analysis employed descriptive statistics, correlation, factor analysis, step-wise regression analysis, analysis of variance, and content analysis. Five participant types were identified in this study: the Explorer, Activity-Oriented, Content-Committed, Convenience-Oriented, and Opportunist. Sixty-three percent of the population could be assigned to one of these categories; 22% were assigned to a combination of two categories; and 15% of the study population did not fit this typology. The two dominant participant types were the Activity-Oriented and the Explorer. This study revealed 18 factors that influence the program choice of older adult educational-travel participants: Social, Comfort, Location, Attend alone, Attend Accompanied, Activity, Information, Cost, Program, Personal Limitations, Escape, Travel, Organizational Attributes, Accessibility, Previous Experience, Dates, Seasonal Influence, and Work. Using step-wise regression analysis, the program choice factors that best discriminated the various participant types were the Activity, Program, Location, Personal Limitations, Accessibility, and Organizational Attributes factors. An analysis of the mean scores revealed that six factors had the greatest influence on program choice: Organizational Attributes, Location, Program, Attending Accompanied, Social and Comfort.</description><creator>Arsenault, Nancy.</creator><contributor>Anderson, Gary (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Adult education.</subject><subject>Older people -- Education.</subject><subject>Elderhostels.</subject><title>A study of educational-travel and older adult learners : participant types and program choices</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jw827d42n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5m60qt78h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0r967538f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:45:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Although the single-path changepoint problem has been extensively treated in the statistical literature, the multi-path changepoint problem has been largely ignored. In the multi-path changepoint setting it is often of interest to assess the impact of covariates on the changepoint itself as well as on the parameters before and after the changepoint. This thesis is concerned with including covariates in the changepoint distribution, a topic never before addressed in the literature. The model we introduce, based on the hazard of change, enjoys features which allow one to establish asymptotic results needed for estimation and testing. Indeed, we establish consistency of the maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters of our model. As the proposed model is a mixture model, two of the difficulties associated with such models are addressed. They are identifiability, and positive definiteness of the information matrix. It is shown that under suitable conditions the set of zeros of the determinant of the information matrix is a nowhere dense set, thus partially compensating for the impossibility of directly establishing positive definiteness. A limited simulation, using simulated annealing, is carried out to assess how the estimation procedure works in practice. In the example presented, the estimators appear to follow an approximately normal distribution even for moderate sample sizes. The maximum likelihood estimators appear to approximate their parameter counterparts well.</description><creator>Asgharian Dastenaei, Masoud.</creator><contributor>Wolfson, David B.

However, field studies have shown limited success and some contradictory results. The basis for successful application appears to be a judicious choice of soil type and parametric constraints. In this study, the surface charges of two soils (kaolinite and illite soils) are used as the primary control in the investigation of electro-osmotic extraction of lead---introduced as a contaminant into the soils. Four types of soils were used: pure kaolinite, illite soil, illite and sand as a mixture, and kaolinite and sand as a mixture. The contaminating lead concentrations, ranging from 100 mg/kg to 5000 mg/kg, were all below the CEC (cation exchange capacity) of the pure soils and their mixtures. Electro-kinetic extraction tests showed that more than 60% of Pb was transported to the cathode in kaolinite, while there was little removal in the illite or sand/illite mixtures. Laboratory results demonstrated that the surface charges of the soils had important effects on the electro-kinetic extraction. In addition, a modified technique, based on electro-chemical processes, was developed to maximize the contaminant extraction and to minimize precipitation at the cathodic region. The study's approach relies on combining electro-kinetics with conditioning fluids and acidification of the cathodic reservoir to enhance the efficiency of contaminant removal. An experimental testing program indicated that the success of electro-kinetic removal was governed by the quantity of H+ ions available in the system. It was also noticed that the hydraulic conductivity (in the same direction of electro-osmotic flow), the conditioning fluid, and acidification of the cathodic reservoir had positive effects on the removal of lead, while the OH- ions produced at the cathode and/or other anions induced during the acidification of the cathodic reservoir had negative effects on lead removal. A modified model, based on interaction energies, was also presented for ion distribution next to the soil particle surface. The removal predictions of this model, through isotherm values, were compared with the results from batch equilibrium tests. A good correlation was noted.</description><creator>Li, Raymond Siu On.</creator><contributor>Yong, Raymond (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Engineering, Environmental.</subject><subject>Engineering, Civil.</subject><title>A study of the efficiency and enhancement of electro-kinetic extraction of a heavy metal from contaminated soils /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h989r4897.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qr46r2779</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wm117q679</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:45:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The project is to unfold the dialogical aspects of human subjectivity as expressed through the existential phenomenology of Heidegger's Being and Time. The investigation is divided into three parts. Part I offers an interpretation of Heidegger's concept of subjectivity with emphasis on the movement from inauthenticity to authenticity. In order to mediate the more traditionally existentialist reading of Dasein's authenticity, I situate Being and Time within Heidegger's larger phenomenological project. This opens up the possibility of thinking about Being-in-the-world and Being-towards-death in terms of a lived intentionality in which Dasein has its own Being as its object. Although Dasein in its everydayness generally only comports toward its own Being in the manner characteristic of empty intentionality, this intention can be fulfilled. This fulfillment constitutes Dasein's authenticity. Part II poses the question: What is dialogue? I illustrate that there are two figures of dialogue---conversation and encounter. Conversation is an exchange between participants which maintains a particular flow and thematic unity, and is based on the structure of question and response. Its possibility rests in the otherness of the participants with respect to one another and in their ability to mediate this difference through some shared basis of meaning. Encounter, on the other hand, is an event of meeting between participants in which the alterity of the other is thrown into high relief by the challenge which it poses to the self, thereby throwing into question both the self and the meaning in which it dwells. Nevertheless, both conversation and encounter can be shown to be dialogical relative to a constellation of concepts. Dialogue is an engagement with alterity marked by a simultaneous continuity and discontinuity with the other. This engagement bears a relation to meaning and is the ground of responsibility and questionability . In Part III, this notion of dialogue is used to interpret Dasein's subjectivity and its becoming authentic. I argue that Dasein's everydayness can be understood as a conversationality in the third person which is transformed into the first-person conversationality of authentic historizing through an encounter with radical alterity in anxious Being-towards-death.</description><creator>MacAvoy, Leslie A.</creator><contributor>Taylor, Charles (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Buckley, R.

Such interconnects utilize two-dimensional smart pixel arrays to take advantage of the additional degree of freedom gained in FSOIs. As a result, thousands of parallel optical channels may be available. This thesis studies the design issues of board-to-board free-space optical interconnections. The impacts of device technology, the data-link topology of multiple-board interconnections, and the imaging mapping between stages are explored. Four types of free-space optical interconnects have been examined in terms of system complexity, scalablity, and alignability. In particular, the alignment tolerance of a symmetric optical interconnect is analytically studied. Comparison of alignment tolerances is carried out between a system with telecentric configuration and a system with maximum lens-to-waist configuration. It has been shown that interconnection between integrated microlenses/transmitters and microlenses/receivers is generally more alignment toleranced than that of non-optical integrated transmitters and receivers. Key issues are identified and explored in the design, implementation and characterization of three types of optical systems, namely macrolens based optical interconnect, microlens based optical interconnect and hybrid-lens based optical interconnect. The microchannel optical interconnect employing a window-clustering scheme is demonstrated as well. The uniformity issue of a spot array generation using diffractive fanout gratings is experimentally studied. Imaging mapping between interconnection stages is developed using a standard matrix representation. For a complex multistage modulator-based free-space optical interconnet, the component requirements, alignment and assembly procedures, characterizing techniques, and system performance are presented. It is believed that modular subsystems with passive in-situ alignment techniques have potential for providing the required alignment solution of implementing free-space board-to-board interconnects.</description><creator>Liu, Yongsheng, 1963-</creator><contributor>Plant, David V.

A better understanding of the mechanisms required for metastases formation in secondary sites will lead to the development of new and more successful treatment strategies. The present work describes our results with a murine Lewis lung carcinoma model which consists of two cell lines, H-59 and M-27, with different patterns of metastasis in vivo. Using this model, a positive correlation was found between the expression of insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) and the ability of the tumor cells to metastasize to the liver. The highly invasive, highly metastatic, liver colonizing cell line H-59 expressed significantly higher levels (5-fold) of IGF-IR than the poorly invasive M-27 cells which metastasize to the lung only. When expression of IGF-IR in H-59 cells was suppressed by transfection with a plasmid vector expressing IGF-IR cDNA in an antisense orientation, the cells lost their proliferative response to IGF-I in vitro, their ability to migrate in response to IGF-I and their metastatic potential. To further study the role of IGF-IR in the process of liver metastasis, IGF-IR was overexpressed in the lung metastasizing M-27 cells by transfection with a plasmid vector expressing full length human IGF-IR cDNA. The stable transfectants had an enhanced proliferative response to IGF-I and hepatocyte conditioned medium (HCM) and acquired an invasive potential as demonstrated in the Matrigel invasion assay. When inoculated via the splenic/portal route in vivo, these cells but not the wild-type or mock-transfected cells gave rise to multiple liver nodules. To further investigate the link between IGF-IR and invasion, metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) expression in the tumor cells was investigated. It was found that the antisense transfected H-59 cells expressed significantly lower levels of MMP-2 as assessed by RT-PCR, Western blot analysis and gelatin zymography.

Studies of the microstructure of extruded ribbons of high density polyethylene (HDPE)/polyamide-6 (PA-6) and polypropylene (PP)/ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH) blends have shown that it is possible to control the flow-induced morphology to generate thin, large and discontinuous overlapping platelets of PA-6 or EVOH dispersed phase in a HDPE or PP matrix phase, respectively. Such polymer blends are known as laminar polymer blends. The laminar blends of HDPE/PA-6 with only small amounts (20 wt%) of the barrier component, i.e. PA-6 resin, produced significant reduction (up to 45 times) in hydrocarbon permeability of extruded ribbons. The PP/EVOH laminar blends with 25 wt% of the barrier component, i.e. EVOH, yielded 10 times improvement in hydrocarbon permeability of the extruded ribbons. The above was achieved by optimizing material characteristics, processing conditions and flow field in the screw zone and in the die unit. In particular, an approach for controlling the mixing and melting steps in the screw zone was introduced, in order to maximize the size of melted particles of the dispersed phase upon entering the die unit. In the die region, extensional flow generated by incorporating converging and diverging sections in the die design, caused the large particles entering the die to be stretched in both directions (machine and transverse directions), thus, producing platelets in the plane of extrusion. The effects of the following factors on morphology development and blend properties were considered and, when possible, manipulated to obtain large particles and deformations of dispersed phase particles: screw zone temperature profile, die temperature, screw design and configuration, composition, pre-compounding, die exit gap size, and cooling system. The influence of the rheology of the system, i.e. the viscosity and elasticity ratios of components, was studied and manipulated to obtain large deformations of dispersed phase particles. The effect of interfacial tension on the morphology and barrier and mechanical properties was investigated and for the HDPE/PA-6 system, the interfacial tension was optimized by controlling the level of compatibilizer, in order to obtain maximum barrier and mechanical performance of the laminar blends. Pressure-Volume-Temperature (P-V-T) characteristics of the individual resins and blends of HDPE/PA-6 were studied, in order to calculate the interfacial tension values and other thermodynamic relationships for compatibilized and non-compatibilized blends of HDPE and PA-6. Various relationships were obtained for predicting the barrier and mechanical properties of the laminar blends from morphological data.</description><creator>Garmabi, Hamid.</creator><contributor>Kamal, M.

Irish musicians as diverse as De Dannan, U2, and Van Morrison have all voiced their debt to the African-American traditions of gospel, rhythm and blues, and jazz. Popular mediums, such as newspaper cartoons and columns, as well as a recent spate of Irish films (The Commitments, The Crying Game , and In the Name of the Father) have characterized the experience of the Irish as colonized subjects, wholly parallel with the experience of disenfranchised African Americans. In a literary context, most examples link the Harlem Renaissance with the Celtic Revival, relying upon instances when James Weldon Johnson, Alain Locke and others connected the two. Often, however, such comparisons have been made at the expense of racial and cultural differences. Relying upon Frederick Douglass's affiliation with the Irish, my dissertation works to uphold racial and cultural differences between African Americans and the Irish in order to assert that it is precisely because of their distinctions that both communities have been useful to each other in the articuation of powerful discourses of liberation. I employ a methodology that simultaneously engages the terms of culture, race, gender, and history, and, in so doing, I engage a more precise mode of analysis that acknowledges the importance of interracial and intercultural exchanges, yet does not insist that differing entities be collapsed into one another in order to achieve understanding of their inter-relationship. I contend that the association between African Americans and the Irish is valuable because they have fashioned a formidable language of liberation out of difference. Furthermore, I contribute a new dimension to African-American literary studies which have suggested that the dialectic between the literary and the political springs from a self-contained Black tradition. In my contention that the Irish cannot be discounted when chronicling an African-American ideology of freedom, I lay to rest claims of African-American exceptionalism as well as notions that literature works out of self-contained entities that are separated by stringent national borders.</description><creator>Ferreira, Patricia J.</creator><contributor>Cope, Karin (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>African Americans -- Irish influences.</subject><subject>Irish -- African American influences.</subject><title>Reading, speaking &amp; writing liberation : African-American and Irish discourse</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h415pc212.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bd44z</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ww72bd43p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:45:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The role of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in the malignant phenotype of human gliomas was examined in this dissertation. A bFGF ELISA, demonstrated to detect recombinant human bFGF protein, was used to quantitate bFGF protein in glioma tissue samples. Basic FGF protein was significantly elevated in low and high grade glioma tissues, suggesting increased bFGF expression could be an early event in the progression of gliomas. Because the tumor sections contained non-tumor elements, bFGF gene and protein expression were examined in established human glioma cell lines. Human glioma cells demonstrated extracellular release of bFGF and expression of higher molecular weight bFGF isoforms. Because secreted bFGF could be important in the malignant phenotype of gliomas, fibroblasts were stably transfected with an expression vector for a secreted bFGF. These cells were more invasive in vitro and in the brain. To confirm and extend these data, non-neoplastic human astrocytes were stably transfected with the bFGF secretion vector. These cells demonstrated features associated with malignant transformation, suggesting increased expression and extracellular release of bFGF could have transforming potential in human astrocytic cells. To determine if bFGF gene and protein expression were required for human glioma cell growth, bFGF-specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotides were tested. The antisense treated glioma cells demonstrated decreased bFGF gene and protein expression and significantly decreased proliferation. Taken together, the data suggests the potential importance of bFGF in glioma cell transformation and growth, and indicates anti-bFGF strategies could be useful in the management of glioma patients.</description><creator>Gately, Stephen T.</creator><contributor>Brem, Steven (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Antel, Jack (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>The potential role of basic fibroblast growth factor in malignant transformation, angiogenesis, invasion and proliferation of human gliomas /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8910jw382.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bd43p</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2n49t3764</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:45:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this thesis is to analyse the function and the modulations of the figure of Rimbaud in the works of Rene Char, from 1927 to 1988 approximately. This analysis, which traces the passage---from the latent to the manifest---of the figure of Rimbaud through Char's works, is situated at the junction of two series of texts, one "interior" (Char's writings on Rimbaud), the other "exterior" (twentieth-century interpretations of Rimbaud). Intertexuality, understood to mean the influence of Rimbaud on Rene Char, emerges as a reading, that is a "critique" of Rimbaud, the elaboration of a "Rimbaldian" text of which Char himself is the legatee. What is designated in this thesis as the "metaphore Rimbaud" in the work of Rene Char refers to a process of aesthetic conceptualization rooted in the figure of Rimbaud. The "conceptual metaphor" (a notion borrowed from the works of Judith Schlanger) constructs rather than describes an interpretation. The metaphor is thus a means of intellectual invention, a heuristic act and an instrument of investigation. For Char, the metaphorical Rimbaud is the space into which he projects and imagines the work to be created. Thus, the figure of Rimbaud, through a working and reworking of discrepancies and margins, is gradually transformed by the poet and becomes, finally, a true metaphor, that is, a conceptual hypothesis which is supple and ample enough to accommodate all of Char's poetry.</description><creator>Fortier, Anne-Marie.</creator><contributor>Ricard, Francois (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Rimbaud, Arthur, 1854-1891.</subject><subject>Char, René, 1907- -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><title>La lecture à l'oeuvre : René Char et la métaphore Rimbaud</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cj82k894f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2n49t3764</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ff365696d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:45:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Polyphenol oxidases are important enzymes because of their role in food spoilage, oxidizing monophenols into o-diphenols and/or diphenols into the corresponding o-quinones. The resulting compounds are unstable and can rapidly form brown colored compounds, called melanins. Polyphenol oxidases, (PPOs) have been purified from several sources, particularly from fruits and vegetables. However, successful purification of PPO to homogeneity from plant sources has always been difficult. The purification procedure of PPOs from cassava tuber consisted of (1) the preparation of cassava acetone powder; (2) the buffer extraction of the acetone powder to obtain a crude extract, followed by one of two possible purification procedures. The first consisted of ammonium sulfate fractionation, ion exchange chromatography on Mono-Q and gel filtration on Superdex G75 to yield two isoenzymes, PPO1 and PP02 having molecular weights of 71.8 +/- 6.0 and 69.6 +/- 1.5 kDa, respectively. The second purification procedure involved hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) on phenyl-sepharose CL-4B followed by gel filtration on Superdex G75 to yield a single active PPO fraction of 68.3 +/- 2.8 kDa molecular weight. The two isoenzymes obtained by ion exchange chromatography exhibited pH optima of 6.5 (PPO1) and 6.8 (PPO2) and were stable in the pH range of 7.5 to 10.0. These two isoenzymes had a temperature optimum of 30--40°C. PPO2 retained 65% of its original activity after heating at 50°C for 10 min whereas PPO1 was completely inactivated by the same treatment. The PPO fraction obtained by HIC purification exhibited a pH optimum of 7.5 with catechol and D,L-dopa as substrates and was stable in the pH range 4 to 8. Its temperature optima, were 20 and 30°C respectively with D,L-dopa and catechol as substrates and this PPO fraction was able to retain 80% of its original activity after heating at 50°C for 10 min. Unstable enzymes were obtained by the ion exchange chromatography purification procedure suggesting that artifacts were created. Kinetic studies performed with the PPO fraction obtained by the HIC purification showed that catechol had the highest catalytic efficiency ratio. The Km values were 28.1, 5.27 and 3.72 mM for catechol, catechin and D,L-dopa, respectively. The PPO from the HIC purification procedure was inhibited by benzoic acid and p-coumaric acid and inactivated by diethyldithiocarbamate but not by EDTA. L-Cysteine, ascorbic acid and its derivatives (erythorbic acid and sodium erythorbate) were also inhibitors of the oxidation of catechol, catechin and D,L-dopa.</description><creator>Barthet, Véronique J.</creator><date>1997</date><subject>Cassava.</subject><subject>Polyphenol oxidase.</subject><title>Polyphenol oxidases from cassava (Manihot esculenta C.) root : extraction, purification and characterization</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cc08hh31x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ff365696d</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4q77ft16c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:45:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation addresses the problem of information gathering with a visual system. We formalize a probabilistic framework for information gathering by defining three components: geometric models, sensor observation models and models for prior information. Geometric models consist mainly of the object model, which describes the structure of the rigid body in a certain fixed coordinate system. Sensor models mathematically describe the mapping between the rigid body coordinates and the statistically corrupted sensor observations. Prior information is encoded in a structured environment assumption, as geometric and dynamic models are assumed known. Within this framework and using an optimization criterion that relates the task at hand to the information gathering process, we demonstrate that a commonly used method, fixation, is not optimal for the class of active perception. This motivates the development of an adaptive strategy for observations. This strategy accounts for sensor and dynamic models uncertainties as well as the task description. For the task of recovering the position and velocity of a moving object, the adaptive strategy is based on a procedure to choose sensor actions which yield the best estimation performance for a receding observation horizon. We derive and discuss the optimization approach; then show how to compute it efficiently, and demonstrate some of its properties through simulations. We also show how this method can be extended to include the internal parameters of the visual system; in particular, the focus and the zoom. In conjunction with sensor control, a Bayesian decision approach is considered to deal with the occlusion problem. This occlusion occurs when the underlying noisy measurement process contains no more information proper to the task at hand. Within the considered framework, information from the occlusion event is derived and used to update the estimates. Finally, we describe a modified dual control strategy that coordinates observation control and robotic arm command for the task of intercepting a moving object. This control approach is compared to more classical control approaches. It is shown that the proposed strategy allows a significant improvement in the convergence rate of the end-effector to the desired trajectory without altering the quality of the estimates.</description><creator>Benameur, Kaouthar.</creator><contributor>Belanger, Pierre R.

Although its reality and nature remain in dispute, people in crucial social roles have taken positions that stigmatize or legitimize the condition. And most sufferers remain convinced that CFS is a real, physical illness. This study examined stigma and legitimation in CFS through semi-structured interviews with doctors (N = 15), insurers (N = 16), significant others (N = 23), and sufferers (N = 43). The findings confirm that CFS is stigmatized by characterizing it as a psychological disorder or a form of malingering. But they also show that the duration of the illness and associated disability are sources of stigma not previously identified with CFS. Furthermore, in the absence of biomedical findings, social judgments about sufferers' credibility became a major factor in legitimizing the illness. By studying stigmatization and legitimation together, it became possible to identify how shifts occurred from one position to the other. By studying doctors, insurers, and significant others, it became evident that five common elements across their different social locations were influencing their views about the illness and its effect on their personal and professional lives or occupational contexts. In turn, these perspectives and effects shaped their reactions to sufferers. Individual and social factors were found to be implicated in sufferers' illness convictions. On a personal level, persistent or recurrent severe somatic symptoms, functional deterioration, and self evaluations led sufferers to conclude they were physically sick At a social level, these beliefs were sustained by intermittent reinforcement from sympathetic doctors, support group members, and selected medical literature. Finally this study showed the personal and social costs associated with both stigmatizing and legitimizing CFS.</description><creator>Beaulieu, Marcia.</creator><contributor>Rains, Prudence (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Robbins, James (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Chronic fatigue syndrome -- Patients -- Social conditions.</subject><title>Stigma and legitimation in chronic fatigue syndrome : the role of social location</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4q77ft17n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ws859h379</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Sociology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xp68kj11s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:45:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Leonardo Sciascia was undoubtedly a prominent figure of Italian public life due to his scathing criticism of the Mafia and of occult power. Unfortunately, most critics have relegated him to the role of mere detractor of Italy's corrupt public and private mores. We cannot deny that he did indeed fulfill this role as well; however the overall literary value of his works by far exceeds that of a statement of charges against organized crime. His literary production can be in fact interpreted as a safe haven for truth against the establishment's drive to obliterate it. This thesis aims at reasserting the true literary value of Sciascia's works. There is in fact a gateway between history and literature and Sciascia crossed it repeatedly by using the investigative essay as a weapon against historiography and the "official" version of facts. It is by this means that Sciascia attained literary craftsmanship without ever departing from his sworn moral commitment to uphold the struggle against the establishment. In this thesis we have analyzed the various literary tools of which Sciascia has made use: the prolonged metaphor, metaphoric speech and the creation of a hybrid genre, the investigative essay. Our analysis led us to some findings which we have expounded in the conclusion.</description><creator>Ben Ahmed, Samir.</creator><contributor>Gilardino, Sergio Maria (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Sciascia, Leonardo -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><title>Sciascia : potere e letteratura</title><language>ita</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9593tw89x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xp68kj11s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Italian</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7p88cj34k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:45:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In many sub-tropical and tropical and regions of the world, marly soils (marls) and lime or cement stabilization of marl soils are used as a convenient and expedient means for development of foundation base courses and inexpensive wearing courses for transport purposes. The failure of many of these natural and stabilized marls to perform their function have been reported. This study uses physico-chemical (reaction) factors to explain the general basic causes for deterioration of the support capability for these types of soil. The presence of palygorskite and sepiolite in marl soils provides it with some very unique features in its natural state, and particularly when it is stabilized with lime or cement. Formation of an expansive mineral ettringite as a transformation product of palygorskite increases the swelling potential of the stabilized soil. The exact mechanism of these failures is still not well known. Reactions between lime, alumina (released from the clay fraction of soil) and sulfates present in the soil pore fluid can cause the formation of ettringite. The possible contribution of palygorskite and sepiolite to the post-stabilization failure due to ettringite formation were investigated. It is shown that the general geotechnical/physical criteria used to evaluate stabilized soil performance not be reliable for the evaluation of stabilized marl due to the possible formation of ettringite and its resultant behaviour. A set of physico-chemical studies, which include specific surface area measurements (SSA) and x-ray diffraction (XRD ), are needed for a more complete and realistic evaluation of the long-term stability of stabilized marl. In this study, a soil washing method for extraction of pure palygorskite or clay fraction from the soil mixture is developed and validated by XRD analysis. Based on the presented results, the pervious classification of marly soils is developed and a new classification for marly soils is proposed. Following establishment of the significant role of palygorskite and sepiolite, through the experimental studies, the current XRD techniques for quantitative mineral analysis of clay soils are evaluated. The accuracy of these methods are investigated by preparation of a series of artificial soil mixtures. Finally, a quantitative XRD method for marly soils and ettringite is presented. In the last part of this study, the major difference in the kinetics of ettringite when artificially formed is compared with that of a stabilized soil, and the role of sulfate, alumina, and calcium on the ettringite formation is investigated. Furthermore, for soil stabilization, the contribution of different clay minerals in ettringite formation is investigated. Among the clay minerals studied, palygorskite was found to be the most rich in alumina, providing the highest source of alumina for ettringite formation.

Differences in the ability of HOX proteins to regulate the transcription of target genes are critical for patterning. The ability of the Hoxd4 gene product to autoregulate expression, which is dependent on TAAT-containing sites in the Hoxd4 promoter, is specific in at HOXA1 fails to recognize these sites. By chimaeric analysis, this specificity was shown to be due to sequence differences in the N-terminal arm. Substitution of the lysine and arginine residues found at positions two and three in HOXD4 into the HOXA1 homeodomain conferred strong DNA binding. Identity at these two positions varies between HOX subfamilies with distinct functions, suggesting that these differences relevant for HOX specificity in vivo. These results are also consistent with the hypothesis that monomeric DNA binding is not sufficient to confer functional specificity. For example, we were unable to detect a high affinity recognition sequence for HOXA1, despite conservation in HOXA1 and its paralogs of numerous residues which contribute to DNA binding in other homeoproteins. We determined that a predicted HOX cofactor, PBX, greatly increased the DNA binding activity of numerous HOX proteins, including HOXA1, to the consensus site TGATTGAT. For both HOXD4 and HOXA1, interaction with PBX is dependent on the pentapeptide, a conserved region N-terminal to the homeodomain. Analysis of HOX/PBX specificity revealed that preferences for the sixth position in consensus site vary depending on the HOX protein used. This position is predicted contacted by the N-terminal arm of the HOX protein via the minor groove. We showed that a conserved arginine (Arg5) in the HOX N-terminal arm contributes to DNA binding in both monomeric and heterodimeric complexes.

An important family of controllers proposed for FACTS are based on high power solid-state switches, such as the gate-turn-off thyristor (GTO), which is presently rated at 6kV, 6kA. The FACTS controller operates at the transmission voltage, in the order of 500kV, and it must be rated at hundreds of MVA. The research of this thesis contributes in developing the methodologies necessary for the integration of the solid-state switches so that the FACTS controllers have the voltage withstand and the current carrying capacity. The methodologies followed in the thesis are based on organizing the solid-state switches firstly in the forms of: (a) 2-level, voltage-source converter modules or (b) multilevel, voltage-source, converter modules. Thereafter, the modules are connected in series and/or in parallel. Switching strategies such as: (i) the phase-shifted triangle carrier technique and (ii) the fundamental frequency switching, are shown to be promising. The thesis addresses the methodologies of uniting the modules: (i) in parallel, (ii) in series and (iii) in parallel groups of series-connected modules. Series connections require magnetic transformers. Transformers also enable 6-phase and 12-phase ac systems to be produced from the standard 3-phase ac utility supply. The thesis has initiated research in incorporating the multi-phase ac systems to the multi-modular, multi-level converters. The thesis has also developed the interface methodology for digital (digital signal processor, DSP) control of the array of modules in real-time. The methodologies of the thesis have been proven in digital simulations and experimentally in laboratory models.</description><creator>Mwinyiwiwa, Bakari M. M.</creator><contributor>Ooi, B. T.

PERF15 is related to the super family of lipophilic transport proteins. It has a molecular mass of 15 kDa and is present exclusively in the subacrosomal region of the sperm head. PERF15 mRNA is expressed at high levels in early spermatids while its expression is not detectable in any other organ or tissue examined. The PERF15 gene contains four exons and three introns. Exon 1 codes for amino acids 1--24, exon 2 for amino acids 25--82, exon 3 for amino acids 83--116, and exon 4 for amino acids 117--132. The three introns are composed of 2241, 547, and 164 bps, respectively. The exon/intron boundaries are identical to those found in the mouse myelin P2 gene but there is no resemblance in size and nucleotide sequence between the corresponding introns of the PERF15 and myelin P2 genes. Mapping of the PERF15 transcription start site by primer extension demonstrated that PERF15 has one initiation site for transcription. Inverse polymerase chain reaction generated a 204 bp fragment located upstream of the transcription initiation site. This DNA fragment was used to screen a genomic library. A positive clone containing the upstream fragment containing the PERF15 promoter region was isolated. The PERF15 promoter contains a TATA element and has homology with regions of testis specific promoters of other mammalian genes such as the mouse protamine 2 E element, mouse protamine 1 promoter, mouse protamine 2 B element, a CRE-like sequence, D1 element of RT7 gene promoter, an AP-1 site, and a CAT-box element.</description><creator>Pouresmaeili, Farkhondeh.</creator><date>1997</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>Molecular cloning and structural analysis of the gene encoding the PERF15 protein in the perinuclear theca of the rat spermatozoa</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g445cg03g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1831cm735</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:tx31qk564</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:45:08Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a key cytokine regulator of an early immune response and a central mediator of the deleterious effects of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, is regulated at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional level. The 3' -untranslated region (3'-UTR) of TNF-alpha mRNA contains sequences that confer its translational repression in quiescent cells and are responsible for the induction of TNF-alpha production following macrophage contact with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, live bacteria, or viruses. We demonstrate that two distinct regions, located in a part of the 3 '-UTR of murine TNF-alpha mRNA previously shown to play a crucial role in the regulation of the stability and translatability, interact with macrophage nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. The first protein binding region is located inside the AU-rich sequence 424 bp downstream of the end of the coding sequence, while the second protein binding region contains a single AUAUUUAU motif and is located 147 bp downstream of the first region. Six detectable protein species interact with the first protein binding region and seven proteins interact with the second binding region. Some of the RNA binding proteins mutually compete for the binding to both regions. TNF-alpha derived cRNA probes form complexes with proteins differentially distributed among the nuclear, cytosolic and particulate fractions of murine macrophages. Three of the TNF-alpha mRNA binding complexes cosediment in the polyribosomal fraction. The stimulation of macrophages with LPS, interferon-gamma, PMA or their combination significantly increases the stability and translational efficiency of TNF-alpha mRNA, yet does not alter the RNA binding activity nor the localization of TNF-alpha mRNA binding proteins, suggesting that regulation of gene expression by RNA-binding proteins may involve other mechanisms, such as posttranslational modification of these proteins or proteins interacting with them rather than global alteration of their amounts in particular cell compartements. The GA dinucleotide insertion inside the first protein binding region, found in NZW and several other strains of mice and associated with lowered ability of peritoneal macrophages to produce TNF-alpha, alters the formation of RNA-protein complexes, supporting their role in the posttranscriptional regulation of TNF-alpha production. Two candidate TNF-alpha mRNA binding proteins were cloned by direct screening of cDNA protein expression library using modified northwestern assay. The
first candidate, D8/FXRIL, represents a variant of murine FXR.l protein, a homolog of
human FMRl (fragile X chromosome mental retardation syndrome gene) (36-40, 42).
A second candidate is a proliferation-associated mitogen-inducible macrophage nuclear
protein p38-2G4. Bath proteins contain a KR RNA binding motif and bind the TNP-a
rnRNA in vitro. Whether these proteins bind the TNF-a mRNA in vivo and what are the
mechanisms of their function remains 10 he established.</description><creator>Hel, Zdenĕk.</creator><contributor>Radzioch, Danuta (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>Posttranscriptional regulation of tumor necrosis factor-a production in macrophages</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8w32r734q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tx31qk564</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:79407z97c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:45:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Sungun porphyry copper deposit is associated with an Andean-type, calc-alkaline diorite/granodiorite to monzonite/quartz-monzonite stock of Miocene age which intruded Eocene volcanosedimentary and Cretaceous carbonate rocks. The intrusive phases are related by fractional crystallization, although surprisingly, the diorite/granodiorite which hosts the mineralization postdates the more evolved quartz monzonite. Copper mineralization was accompanied by both potassic and phyllic alteration. The hydrothermal system involved both magmatic and meteoric waters, and boiled extensively. Molybdenum was concentrated at a very early stage in the evolution of the hydrothermal system and copper later. Early hydrothermal alteration, which was caused by high temperature (340 to &gt;500°C), high salinity ( ~ 60 wt % NaCl equiv.) orthomagmatic fluid, produced a potassic assemblage characterized by addition of K and Cu and depletions in Na, Ca, Mg and Fe in the central part of the stock. Propylitic alteration, which is attributed to a liquid-rich, lower temperature (240--330°C), Ca-rich, evolved meteoric fluid occurred contemporaneously with potassic alteration, but in the peripheral parts of the stock. Phyllic alteration occurred later, at temperatures in the range from 300 to 360°C, overprinting these earlier alterations, and was accompanied by additions of Si (silicification) at the expense of Na, K and Fe and remobilization of Cu from the potassic zone. It resulted from the inflow of oxidized and acidic meteoric waters with decreasing temperature of the system. During potassic alteration, copper solubility is calculated to have been &gt;100,000 ppm, whereas the copper content of the initial fluid responsible for ore deposition was 1200--3800 ppm. This indicates that the fluid was initially undersaturated with respect to chalcopyrite, which agrees with the observation that veins which formed at T &gt; 400°C contain molybdenite but rarely chalcopyrite.

In deriving results from this theory one relies on perturbative calculations. Sometimes indirect methods have been explored to circumvent direct calculation of pure gluonic amplitudes. For example, it has been shown that supersymmetric extension of QCD along with supersymmetric Ward identities can be used to establish relations between amplitudes with the same total number of particles but a different number of gluons. Such relations are used here to connect pure gluonic and pure fermionic amplitudes in the case of 4-pt and 6-pt functions. These relations offer an indirect way of calculating tree level pure gluonic amplitudes since these amplitudes are identical in supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric QCD. The aforementioned relations however, provide no insight into the relation between Feynman diagram of the amplitudes involved. In this regard, we investigate the relation between individual Feynman diagrams in the Wess-Zumino model. Another calculational difficulty arises when one is concerned with high energy scattering in QCD. In the high energy regime, because the effective coupling constant is relatively large, it is necessary to sum up an infinite number of diagrams. This is made even more difficult due to the cancellations in certain color channels that occurs at any perturbative order. The new non-abelian cut diagram technique provides considerable assistance by giving the result with the cancellations already built into its rules. Sixth-order calculations are carried out to show the efficiency of this technique. Finally, we consider the question of diagram with fermion loops that need regularization because of their UV divergence. We find that regularization leads to an enhancement in their high energy behavior.</description><creator>Hamidi-Ravari, Omid.</creator><contributor>Lam, C. S.

Laboratory-prepared resins of a known composition were compared and contrasted to a commercial version with regard to surface area, porosity, and vinylbenzene content. The commercial resin, Amberlite XAD-4 (Rohm and Haas Company), had a higher surface area (831 m2 /g), porosity (1.18 mL/g), and accessible vinylbenzene groups (2.5 mmol/g, degree of functionalization 33%). Modifications of both resins by radical addition of a variety of thiols led to higher conversions (of vinylbenzene groups to modified groups) with use of the commercial resin (as high as 76%). Further modifications were done strictly with XAD-4. Some thiol additions to XAD-4 were done with water as the solvent, with conversions as high as 43%. Disulfides were added across the vinylbenzene groups of XAD-4 with iodine catalysis, with conversions as high as 55%. This simple one-step reaction has never been done with a polymer system before. XAD-4 was completely epoxidized using a solution of dimethyldioxirane in acetone, and completely brominated to form a resin with (1,2-dibromoethyl)benzene groups (3.76 mmol Br/g). Resins with (1-hydroxy-2-bromoethyl)benzene groups (1.5 mmol/g) were prepared by reaction of XAD-4 with N-bromosuccinimide and water, with 73% conversion. Resins with thiol groups (2.5 mmol S/g) were prepared by a one-pot reaction of brominated XAD-4 with N,N-dimethylthioformamide followed by methanolysis. From one commercially-available resin, several polymers with a variety of functional groups have thus been prepared by simple one- to three-step modifications.</description><creator>Hubbard, K.

The model predicts the physical structure of the gas discharge obtained between two electrodes, when one is covered with a dielectric material: It predicts the distribution of the electron and ion particle densities, electron energy, and electric field strength. It is a self-consistent numerical model, in which the dielectric properties of the dielectric material are included and the geometry of the electrodes is taken into account, thus coupling the charged-particle transport to the electric field. New boundary conditions are developed for the electron gas at the anode; the results indicate that the common boundary conditions frequently used in the literature give solutions with non-physical behavior. The new boundary conditions give solutions with the expected physical behavior. The equations of the model are formulated numerically using a Galerkin finite element method and solved using the Newton iteration method. New universal matrices for the finite element method are presented which can be used to construct complex finite element matrices, by replacing integrals with matrix products, in a consistent and uniform manner independent of element shape, dimensionality, and order. Solutions for DC, pulse-waveform and time-harmonic applied electrode voltages for geometries with and without a dielectric barrier are presented. The regulating effect of the dielectric barrier by surface charge accumulation is shown for discharge under constant applied voltage, assuming a static temperature for the electron gas, for the full self-consistent model. Also, simulations of dielectric barrier discharge with applied pulse-waveform voltages are compared with simulations of applied time-harmonic voltages. The results show very similar period-averaged electric fields, electron temperature profiles, charged particle densities, and total conduction current densities. However, a much higher period-integrated ionization rate is obtained from voltage pulse simulations, compared to time-harmonic voltage simulations. Therefore, we obtain a greater reaction rate for an equivalent conduction current, in a period-averaged sense, for a discharge driven by pulse-waveform applied voltages than with time-harmonic applied voltages. Such a difference was not observed for simulations without the dielectric barrier.</description><creator>Dufresne, Michel, 1962-</creator><contributor>McFee, Steven (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Fluid model of dielectric barrier gas discharge</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m613n0391.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1c18dh536</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:b8515q100</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:45:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation seeks to fill two lacunae in contemporary feminist discussions of essentialism: first, a lack of critical analysis of the term "essentialism" and its cognates, and second, a paucity of feminist work that aims to develop anti-essentialist methods rather than merely presenting anti-essentialist critiques of existing feminist theories. I propose a typology of feminist essentialisms, distinguishing metaphysical, biological, linguistic, and methodological variants. I argue that methodological essentialism---understood as the practice of making false generalisations about women based on the experiences and identities only of a particular group---is the most pressing political issue for feminists, and defend Elizabeth Spelman's anti-essentialist critique against its opponents. Anti-essentialism should not, however, be interpreted as disavowing the category "women" altogether, and I use Ludwig Wittgenstein's arguments in his Philosophical Investigations to articulate a form of feminist anti-essentialism. that understands similarities between women as family resemblances. This approach enables feminists to make generalisations about women that neither obscure important differences nor deminise our political efficacy. This Wittgensteinian feminism rejects the a priori and urges us to "look and see" to justify generalisations about women. I interpret this as a call for a feminist anti-essentialism that is embedded in feminist practice, and ask what "look and see" might mean for feminist research and for feminist organising against sexual violence. In chapter four, I argue that Carol Gilligan's recent work on girls' psychology in the context of race and class differences successfully responds to long-standing charges that her research is essentialist. It does not, however, fully meet the methodological challenge of anti-essentialism as it fails to acknowledge power relations embedded in research processes, which in turn shape conclusions about female identi</description><creator>Heyes, Cressida J.</creator><contributor>Tully, James (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Deslauriers, Marguertie (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Essence (Philosophy)</subject><subject>Feminist theory.</subject><subject>Wittgenstein, Ludwig, 1889-1951 -- Contributions in philosophy of essence.</subject><title>'Back to the rough ground!' : Wittgenstein, essentialism, and feminist methods</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xs55md60r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b8515q100</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Philosophy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):34375</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
