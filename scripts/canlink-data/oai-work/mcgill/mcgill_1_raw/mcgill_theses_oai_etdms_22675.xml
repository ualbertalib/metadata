This thesis provides an exploration of approaches to representation in visual anthropology, with specific emphasis on collaborative visual ethnography. Both theoretical and practical issues are considered. The first chapter traces the history of ethnographic film and discusses various approaches to subject participation in literature and films. The second chapter presents a theoretical basis for collaborative visual ethnography, primarily from "postmodern" critiques of anthropology and recent visual anthropology literature. The third chapter consists of an analysis of a video resulting from a collaborative project I facilitated, in order to illustrate ideas of collaborative visual ethnography in a practical setting. The fourth, and final, chapter examines the few examples of collaborative film and video that are documented in order to construct a framework for approaching collaborative projects.</description><creator>Folkerth, Jennifer Amanda</creator><contributor>Aronson, Dan (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Ethnology -- Methodology.</subject><subject>Motion pictures in ethnology -- Case studies.</subject><subject>Visual anthropology.</subject><title>Shared visions : toward collaborative visual ethnography</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j67314819.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j96021680</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anthropology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4m90dw428</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:57:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study proposes an in-depth analysis of the concept of imagination in the Essais as it emerges through various occurrences of the words "imagination" and "fantasie" (synonymous in the XVIth century) and their numerous derivatives. By focusing on two fundamental characteristics of this faculty, its "autonomy" and "power of sensory representation", this dissertation argues that Montaigne's idea of imagination, intimately related to man's desire and presumptuousness, is based on an essential ambivalence by which it produces indifferently real or illusory images, representations of truth as well as falsehood. This work explores the actualisation of this paradoxical character of imagination in its relationship with nature and in its participation in the knowledge process. The study considers both Montaigne's own thinking and the act of writing through which it is realized, form and matter being inseparable for the essayist.</description><creator>Fontaine, Guylaine</creator><contributor>Desrosiers-Bonin, Diane (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Montaigne, Michel de, 1533-1592.

This thesis attempts to fill the void and also to identify areas where further research may be conducted. The thesis treats the educational habits of Italian children in the Catholic schools of Montreal between the years 1895 and 1960. The thesis looks at enrolment patterns and language instruction in the Catholic elementary schools of Montreal. It was found that language played an important role in Catholic schools frequented by Italian children. Italian children were educated in the English, French and Italian languages on and off from the beginning of the twentieth century to the late 1950's. Furthermore, a discernible shift in the attendance of Italian children from French to English Catholic schools occurred after World War II. So much so, that by the 1960's nearly 80% of Italian children were attending English Catholic schools.</description><creator>Gadler, Yves Carmelo Luciano</creator><contributor>Magnuson, Roger (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Catholic elementary schools -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</subject><subject>Italians -- Education, Elementary -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><title>"The education of Italians in Montreal, 1895 to 1960"</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0z708x492.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hd04n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z029p5546</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:57:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The hydrolysis of iron(III) from sulphate bearing aqueous solutions was investigated to significantly improve the neutralization of acidic mineral effluents. Both theoretical and experimental studies were undertaken. A literature review and a thermodynamic analysis of the Fe(III)-SO$ sb4$-H$ sb2$O system were performed. The thermodynamic analysis determined that Fe(III)-sulphato complexes dominate in the acidic pH range (pH $&lt;$ 4) while at neutral to mild alkaline pH range Fe(OH)$ sb3 sp circ sb{ rm (aq)}$ is the dominant species. It was found that a relationship exists between the precipitation pH and the sulphate content of the precipitate (17% at pH 3, 7-9% at pH 6 and 1-2% at pH 9) and it was attributed in part to the existence of the precursor Fe(III)-sulphato complexes and in part to SO$ sb4 sp{2-}$ adsorption on the Fe(III) oxyhydroxide solid phase. Several variables were examined for their influence on the properties of the iron(III) hydrolysis products, such as: pH, neutralization rate, temperature, agitation rate, sulphate concentration and ionic strength. Tests were performed in a batch reactor and NaOH was selected as the most effective neutralizing reagent. Treatment sludges were characterized physically (e.g., solids content, settling rate, etc.), chemically and morphologically, while the treated effluent was examined for residual iron(III) content. These tests proved only partially successful as the precipitates produced were highly amorphous with low solids content (${&lt;8 %}$) and poor settling (${&lt;3}$ m/hr). However, exceptionally good precipitates were produced when the hydrolysis tests were performed under supersaturation control. This work led to the development of a novel approach to neutralization of effluents involving sludge recycling and staged neutralization in order to maintain a low and controlled supersaturation level. Via this novel method partially crystallized precipitates of excellent properties were produced at 50$ sp circ$C after eight recycles.

Research findings are divergent: some studies suggest that adolescents are not adversely affected while other studies show that adolescents' functioning is affected in a permanent way by parental separation. Ambert and Saucier (1983) reviewed adolescents' perceptions of parents, controlling for gender and parental marital status. Their findings suggested that adolescents perceive their parents differently on the basis of marital status and gender. Inspired by Ambert and Saucier's research, this exploratory study was based on interviews with eighteen adolescents, in an attempt to understand how family composition and gender influences adolescent perceptions of parents. The subjects were from divorced and intact families and the results were analyzed qualitatively. It was assumed that adjustment to parental separation or divorce would be reflected in the adolescents' perceptions of their parents. Contrary to expectations, the findings of this study indicated that adolescents from both intact and divorced families perceived their parents in a similar way. These findings are attributed to several factors, including the absence of interparental hostility, the length of time since the separation and economic stability within these families.</description><creator>Payette, Robert</creator><contributor>Baker, Maureen (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Broken homes.</subject><subject>Parent and teenager.</subject><title>Adolescents' perceptions of parents and parents' marital status</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6682x488b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8k71nh96h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:47429b148</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:57:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The self-cycling fermentation (SCF) technique was used to grow three species of the genus Streptomyces which have been described as producing antibiotics. Application of this technique led to reproducible growth patterns for filamentous organisms. Control of the system using the CO$ sb2$ concentration in the off-gas was achieved under conditions which prevented monitoring of the dissolved oxygen. It was also possible to use the SCF system with either defined or complex media. Production of tetracycline by S. aureofaciens was obtained on an iron-deficient medium. The production rate was as high as 0.272 g tetracycline/g sucrose/h. This was comparable with that reported for tetracycline in the patent literature. Growth patterns of the SCF when tetracycline was present in the fermenter were erratic, demonstrating the negative effect of the antibiotic on the growth of the producer organism. Further growth in a secondary fermenter system resulted in additional production over a period of about fifteen hours. In these experiments, tetracycline exhibited characteristics of a siderophore.</description><creator>Zenaitis, Michael G. (Michael Guy)</creator><contributor>Cooper, David G.

Four cylinder diameters: 1", 1.25", 2.35", and 4", along with three different mixtures: stoichiometric, equimolar, and 40% argon diluted oxyacetylene, are used interchangeably. The initial pressure is varied from 20 to 90 torr. Experiments are performed in a two dimensional rectangular channel with a test section 1085 mm long, 101 mm wide, and 25.4 mm thick. High speed framing Schlieren photographs of the diffraction phenomena are taken. Smoke foils are also used to provide a record of the change in cell size during the diffraction process. The distance of re-initiation behind the cylinder is found to be inversely proportional to the ratio of cylinder diameter to cell size, D/$ lambda$. Also, for low D/$ lambda$ values, a region is formed in the cylinder's wake and prior to re-initiation where the cell structure fails. However, for large D/$ lambda$ values, the diffraction has little effect on the cell structure. For low D/$ lambda$, re-initiation is triggered by the collision of transverse waves downstream the cylinder in the region where no cell structure exists. For high values of D/$ lambda$, re-initiation is a result of the transition from regular to strong reflection of the two diffracted waves colliding with each other. The diffraction pattern becomes independent of cell size. In the theoretical investigation, the problem is divided into two cases: diffraction along the upstream half of the cylinder, and that along the downstream half. The first case deals with detonation propagation in converging channels and an approach similar to Whitham's can be used. The second case deals with detonation propagation in diverging channels, and a theory is developed based on Murray's equation relating velocity deficit to area increase between the shock and CJ plane.

Little research has been conducted in the area of the bending and vibrations associated with ITH (In - The - Hole) drills. This thesis deals with the modelling of the static and dynamic properties of the ITH drill system. The bending of the drill string is the result of the string becoming unstable. The critical length and feed force of the ITH drill string before being unstabilized and its characteristics after unstabilization are studied. By analyzing the static and dynamic properties of the drill string, a continuous system mathematical model has been developed. Two different boundary conditions have been discussed and applied through computer simulations. Measurements of downhole parameters and vibrations while drilling were acquired by a high-rate telemetry and data acquisition system from field tests of a CMS CD-90B long-hole ITH drill and prototype shock absorber in an underground nickel mine. Determining the inter-relationships between the drilling parameters and the vibrations is also a principal objective of the thesis. The performance of a prototype shock absorber developed by a third party company was also evaluated. The results of the simulations and analyses of the vibration data indicate that a prototype shock absorber effectively reduces the amplitude of the vibrations. A mathematical model using a complex boundary condition has been developed which will be of use in further research relating to the development of a vibration-based control system for ITH drills. By decreasing the vibration levels acting on the drill head and rod, the instrumentation for an automated drill can be protected to ensure maximum life and proper performance during hammer operation.
