In both cases, the features that are used in the matching process are point coordinates in Euclidean n-space, ${ rm I !E} sp{n}.$ The patterns being matched are assumed to be related by a combination of two transformations: (1) a permutation of the feature points which establishes the correspondence between the feature points of the different patterns and (2) a global geometric transformation based on rigid motions which aligns the patterns once the point correspondences are known. The problem of finding the first transformation, known as the point correspondence problem, is the most demanding part of the matching process in terms of computational requirements; accordingly, the focus is placed on the algorithms' ability to establish point correspondences. Computer simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms' respective search strategies in terms of both the accuracy of the final solution and the speed with which the solution is obtained. In all of the experiments, the performance of the graph matching algorithm is clearly superior to that of the SVD-based method in terms of both speed and accuracy; however, it is shown that the computational requirements of the tree search procedure used by the graph matching algorithm are strongly dependent on factors such as the magnitude of the noises that are contained in the patterns and on the mutual distances between the feature points. The major weakness of the SVD-based algorithm is its inconsistency in converging to the expected solution, especially when extra or occluded points are present in one or more of the patterns to be matched.</description><creator>Ifrah, Philip.</creator><contributor>Morgera, S.

For sodium acrylate and sodium polyacrylate, the removal of lead increased, and the reagent loss decreased when using sodium polyacrylate compared to the monomer, and when using a polymer with higher molecular weight. Sodium propionate did not precipitate lead. Sodium oleate formed a suspension with lead. Sodium caprate formed an easily filterable precipitate. For a feed concentration of 1450 ppm lead, and a mole ratio of caprate to lead of 2, the percentage removal of lead and the percentage loss of caprate were 99.5 $ pm$ 0.2% and 0.8 $ pm$ 0.3%, respectively. The effects of pH, concentrations of lead, calcium, chloride and nitrate in the feed on the removal step were determined. For a certain amount of added caprate, the equilibrium concentrations of lead and caprate were independent of the feed concentration of lead. Decreasing the pH of the feed decreased the removal of lead, but did not affect the loss of caprate. The presence of calcium or nitrate in the feed did not affect the removal of lead. At high chloride concentration, C$ sp circ$(Cl$ sp{-}$) $&gt;$ 0.7 M, the loss of caprate increased slightly. Sodium caprate was recovered by adding HNO$ sb3$ to form capric acid. The sodium caprate was regenerated by adding NaOH. A percentage regeneration of 98.9 $ pm$ 0.3% was achieved.</description><creator>Husein, Maen</creator><contributor>Vera, J.

The algorithms use the carrier signals transmitted by the satellites of the Global Positioning System (GPS). Modern navigation applications such as high-performance aircraft landing demand not only high precision, but also real-time operation on highly dynamic platforms. Unlike the original batch-processing techniques or snap-shot processing, the recursive filter developed in this thesis accomplishes real-time positioning using data as it becomes available from integrated Doppler measurements. The recursive Kalman filter method converges on the least-squares estimate for floating point values of the integer ambiguities. The integer ambiguities are the unknown quantities in the double differences of the carrier phase observables. Rather than considering only a constant velocity state model, the algorithm makes use of triple difference measurements to propagate the state in a complimentary Kalman filter approach. The triple difference propagation technique reduces the dependence of convergence speed on the dynamics of the scenario, thereby enabling the filter to handle highly dynamic platforms. Safety and usability impose strict requirements on the integrity of the positioning solutions. The process of fault detection and exclusion (FDE) is, therefore, an essential component of a robust high precision positioning algorithm. A Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) subsystem is developed to address these requirements. The basis of the fault detection and exclusion procedures is the single difference residual of the Kalman filter innovations process. Obstacles to integrating the positioning and integrity algorithms are presented and subsequently solved. Finally, simulations of the positioning and integrity algorithms are implemented and demonstrate the superior performance of these algor</description><creator>Hunzinger, Jason F.</creator><contributor>Morgera, Salvatore D.

Free-space optical interconnects have the potential to meet these demands. This thesis explores the application of a two-dimensional array of metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) photodetectors in a free-space photonic backplane. In particular, two-dimensional smart pixels are presented as a means of achieving a large communications space-bandwidth product. It is argued that a system based on such devices can overcome several physical limitations experienced by electrical interconnects of current printed circuit board based electronic backplanes. As a means to this end, a review of MSM photodetector technology is then conducted. The layout and design of the optical receiver is presented. The effects of misalignments, optical power variations, and device non-uniformity on receiver performance are considered. With these design parameters in mind, the construction of a receiver assembly is described from the first step of packaging the photodetector array to the last interconnecting cable connection. Specific packaging challenges that are discussed include power dissipation, connectivity, and electrical isolation as related to receiver performance. The method and results of characterization are presented in relation to its meeting the requirements of a receiver array in a free-space optical backplane. Future areas for improvement are then considered.</description><creator>Hsiao, Wayne.</creator><contributor>Plant, David (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Integration and characterization of an MSM array for free-space optical backplanes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v979v497p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/41687k21d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fb494b35n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:05:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The goal of this thesis is to analyze and implement a new method to increase the spatial resolution of an image beyond that expected from detector arrays and detector sensitivity. The methods described here are based on the papers (16, 17, 18, 19) by Masry. First, the problem of reconstructing a signal is addressed and solved using some modifications to the method presented in (16). The modified method is faster and more accurate than the one described in (16, 19). The problem of reconstructing an analog signal in the time-domain is then transformed into a problem of reconstructing an image in the spatial-domain. A new methodology to reconstruct an image is presented, which is based on statistical concepts and also on the method developed here to reconstruct a signal. The advantages of the methods developed here are that the computational load is small compared to other methods used in the past, and that the algorithm is very easy to implement.</description><creator>Hernández-Alonso, Diana.</creator><contributor>Galiana, H.

They are a class of digital circuits which, augmented with a minimum of analog circuitry requiring no trimming, generate fully programmable, high-quality analog sinusoidal signals. A generalization of previous work, they can meet arbitrary signal-band and SNR specifications at a minimum digital hardware cost, and without the previously reported stability problems. It is shown that multitone generation requires but simple modifications to the basic oscillator topology; this signal generation scheme is thus highly attractive for endowing mixed-signal integrated circuits and systems with self-test capabilities. Delta-sigma oscillators can be useful in other applications as well. An essential building block of delta-sigma oscillators is a one-bit digital delta-sigma modulator with unity Signal-Transfer-Function. A complete, computer-aided design method, relying on a novel high-order modulator topology allowing the use of power-of-two coefficients, is formulated and justified. Although the resulting modulators are aimed specifically at usage in delta-sigma oscillators, they can find applications in oversampled D/A conversion in general as they require a minimal amount of digital hardware. DSMOD is the computer-aided design tool which was developed to automate the design, simulation and prototyping processes. It implements a number of involved design algorithms, and allows for a quick comparison of theoretical, simulated and prototype behavior, with the use of a graphical user interface. It is written mostly for MATLAB and is thus highly portable and expandable. The measurements performed on prototypes prove the soundness, flexibility and efficiency of DSMOD. They also prove that low hardware cost and high performance levels are attainable with the novel delta-sigma modulator and oscillator topologies presented here.</description><creator>Haurie, Xavier.</creator><contributor>Roberts, Gordon W.

This thesis describes an automated tracer-independent MRI/PET registration method, in which the registration of MR images to tracer-independent PET transmission images is performed to register the corresponding MRI and PET emission images. Two voxel-based registration methods--mutual information method (MI) and voxel intensity ratio (VR) method, were implemented for the registration of MRI/PET transmission images. The validation of the two registration methods was first performed on simulated PET transmission images with real MR images. The quantitative evaluation of these registration results reveals that the MI method gives more accurate registration results (mean 3-D registration error less than 2 mm) than the VR method (mean 3-D registration error more than 2.5 mm); and the MI method is more robust against noise and data truncation than the VR method. Both methods are more sensitive to low spatial resolution than to the noise of the PET transmission images. The validation of the MI method on real MRI/PET images was also carried out, and the results show no obvious misregistration by visual inspection. Tracer-independent MRI/PET registration using the MI algorithm is shown to be a feasible and robust method to register the MRI to PET images, regardless of the tracer used in the PET studies.</description><creator>Gu, Wei Q.</creator><contributor>Evans, Alan (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Automated tracer-independent MRIPET image registration</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jh343v02p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rn3013358</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n009w4316</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:05:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis, we study the problem of large wrench application using robotic systems with limited force or torque actuators. It is shown that such systems may be able to apply a wrench in some configurations only; therefore their useful Force Workspace is limited, and may be smaller than their reachable workspace. To improve the force capabilities of a system, base mobility or redundancy can be employed. A planning algorithm is proposed which results in proper base positioning relative to large-force quasi-static tasks. Similarly, the Force Workspace can be used to position such tasks relative to a robotic system. An efficient numerical algorithm is proposed to generate the Force Workspace, based on the 2$ sp{n}$-tree decomposition of the Cartesian space. Its efficiency stems from the variable resolution nature of the Cartesian space representation, and also from the use of four test levels that restrict the search to valid regions of the Cartesian space only. Examples of Force Workspaces are given for redundant and non-redundant planar manipulators, and spatial manipulators. Next, the case of tasks requiring the application of a wrench along a given path is considered. The Task Workspace, the set of Cartesian space locations that are valid starting positions for such tasks, is shown to be a subset of the Force Workspace. To plan redundant manipulator postures during large force-tasks, a new method based on a mini-max optimization scheme is developed.

Various types of high speed modulators have been reported; among them the Mach-Zehnder interferometric modulators using Y-branches is one of the most widely used structures for broadband modulation because of its simplicity and easy fabrication. Traveling-wave integrated optical modulators fabricated in substrate materials for which the optical and microwave velocities are equal offer the potential of very broad modulation bandwidth. In order to achieve broadband electrooptic intensity modulators, design optimization is very important. A thorough understanding of the characteristics of the electrode structure permits parameter optimization in the design of electrooptic modulators. In this thesis, calculations of the electric field distribution, impedance, and the effective index for microwaves are presented using the Fourier-series method for a quasi-static analysis of coplanar waveguide (CPW). Using this approach, the design optimization will also be discussed.</description><creator>Gan, Feng Yuan, 1967-</creator><contributor>Yip, G. L.

A sensitive technique to quantify the retention of contaminants on the pulp is to follow the dynamics of retention of a concentration pulse generated at the entrance (breakthrough curve, BTC) of a packed bed of fibers. Using this technique, we showed that sodium salts of fatty acids undergo ion-exchange with the calcium present in the pulp. Soap prepared by mixing equimolar amounts of sodium oleate and calcium chloride (1 Meq) do not adsorb on pulp fibers. However, retention of the soap particles increases as the Calcium chloride concentration is increased to 0.164 and 1.48 mmol/L. This is due to a charge screening mechanism expected in the presence of an electrolyte. In the presence of a trivalent cation, such as Al$ sp{+3}$, the mechanism becomes more complicated as Al$ sp{+3}$ ions undergo adsorption or ion-exchange with the Ca$ sp{+2}$; this renders the soap particles positive.

Examination of the behaviour of crack development was also examined. Fourteen simply supported concrete beams were cast and subjected to two third point concentrated loads, increased monotonically until failure. The strength, strain and crack development data were recorded to assess the corrosion rate and its effect on the steel bars. An electrochemical system was used to achieve the different corrosion levels. The specimens were immersed in a 5 percent of sodium chloride by weight of water for a period of one to thirty weeks. An initial voltage of 1 volt was impressed through the beams to initiate and to accelerate the corrosion process. A steel plate was immersed in the solution to act as a cathode and force the steel reinforced concrete beam to act as an anode. The report discusses the defects and environmental factors influencing the corrosion process. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)</description><creator>Fazio, Robert, 1970-</creator><contributor>Mirza, M.

The wastewater entering the treatment facility consists of a combination of waste streams derived from various stages of the process. Activated sludge treatment is sensitive to various operating conditions, including waste stream composition. Changes in operating conditions will affect the treatment process kinetics. The effect of effluent variation was examined using both mathematical modelling and experimental investigation. Mathematical modelling was used to identify the rate parameters having the most significant effect on the system when varied. Experimental studies considered three different CTMP effluents (lean white water, chip wash water and inter-stage wash) and the total mill effluent in order to investigate the actual observed effects of effluent variation. Only the inter-stage wash was found to produce an inhibitory effect, while the other two effluents produced a non-inhibitory effect.</description><creator>Domnik, Corinna S.</creator><contributor>Berk, D.

This contactor consists of one rotating jet in the annular region with a cylinder mounted centrally in the vessel. The key hydrodynamic characteristics, e.g., minimum spouting velocity, peak and steady spouting pressure drops were measured using different particles. Effects of the spouting jet rotational speed, bed height, nozzle diameter as well as particle size, shape and density were determined experimentally. Empirical correlations are developed to predict the values of these quantities. Drying kinetics were studied using rewetted wheat as the test material. Effects of inlet air temperature and bed height on drying rates in the RJASB were studied. Both experimental and finite element simulation results were used to develop a new correlation for the effective water diffusion coefficient in wheat based on a two-dimensional diffusion model.</description><creator>Devahastin, Sakamon.</creator><contributor>Mujumdar, A.

The core of the experimental work is the oil imbibition experiment in two unsaturated mixtures of silica sand and kaolinite clay (80%/20% and 60%/40% by weight). To investigate the effect of capillary forces on multiphase flow, three series of oil imbibition tests were performed with each type of soil: (1) Maximum capillary forces system, in which the soil mixtures were moulded with distilled water. (2) Intermediate capillary forces system, in which the soil mixtures were moulded with a 3% aqueous surfactant solution. (3) Minimum capillary forces system, in which the soil mixtures were moulded with a 6% aqueous surfactant solution. The durations of the oil imbibition experiments were 1, 2 and 3 days for the 80/20 mixture, and 3, 5 and 10 days for the 60/40 soil, for a total of 18 tests (9 per soil types). At the end of each experiment, the soil mixtures were sectioned to determine the water and oil contents of a predetermined number of samples. Additional laboratory work was carried out to characterize the soil mixtures, moulding liquids and motor oil used in this study. The modelling of oil migration in an unsaturated soil was carried out with the one dimensional form of the classical diffusion equation. Using the oil concentration profile curves and the Boltzmann transform technique, the oil diffusivities, D, were computed. The commercial program Tablecurve was then employed to determine the diffusivity function end parameters that best fit the computed D-$ theta$ relationship. The diffusivity function was then substituted in the finite difference form of the above-mentioned flow equation. By comparing the simulated results with the experimentally derived curves, the model was calibrated prior to predicting the time required to saturate the soil mixtures.</description><creator>Desjardins, René.</creator><contributor>Mohamed, A.

The work is motivated by the need for local high bandwidth sensors at the robot's end effector to provide feedback during the pre-contact stage. Two types of amplitude based IR sensors were designed, an "Electrically Biased Sensor" (EBS) and a "Photon Biased Sensor" (PBS). The PBS sensor has a diameter of 5.55 mm and a range of approximately 9.0 cm. The EBS sensor has a diameter of 7.15 mm and a range of approximately 11.2 cm. Both sensors are robust and inexpensive since they were constructed using low-cost, off the shelf components. The design of the sensor heads, the signal processing electronics and the sensor characteristics will be discussed.</description><creator>Damianakis, John.</creator><contributor>Buehler, Martin (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Engineering, Industrial.</subject><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Proximity sensor network for sensor based manipulation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pz50gz11v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/np193b95h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2514nn386</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:05:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Flash X-ray and high speed photography were used to experimentally investigate the fragmentation process of single tin drops (0.5 g) in water during a steam explosion. Water velocities ranging from 9 to 28 m/s and a melt temperature of 800$ sp circ$C were used in order to study the effect of the water velocity on the drop fragmentation. Tests were also conducted in which the drop break-up was due entirely to hydrodynamic effects to evaluate the influence of the thermal energy on the fragmentation mechanism. Results showed that there was a transition from thermal to hydrodynamic fragmentation through an intermediate stage in which the drops initially underwent hydrodynamic fragmentation followed by the formation of a vapour bubble. For low velocities (9 m/s) this bubble collapsed, fragmenting the remainder of the drop while at great velocities (15 m/s) the drop broke up within the bubble before it condensed. At 22 and 28 m/s there was no vapour formation and the drop fragmented due to hydrodynamic effects. The total non-dimensional break-up time was 2.0-2.5 for all cases.</description><creator>Cunningham, Mark Huzzard.</creator><contributor>Frost, David (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Effect of coolant velocity on the fragmentation of single melt drops in water</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1r66j3125.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2514nn386</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k643b315s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:05:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The objective of this thesis was to determine, by means of discrete element simulations of ice floes, information that could be used for continuum modelling of broken ice covers on waterways. The ice floes or 'particles' were modelled as random-sized circular disks. The internal angles of friction for cohesionless assemblies of particles under compression were determined using molecular dynamics type simulations of biaxial tests. Constant confining pressures as well as constant displacement rates were used for the biaxial tests. Stress-strain curves were obtained for a range of confining pressures. The yield envelopes were found to be represented by a Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion. The effect of the interparticle friction coefficient on the global angle of friction was examined. It was found that the internal angle of friction was essentially independent of the interparticle friction angle. Furthermore, assemblies with different particle size distributions were used in order to investigate the effects of this parameter on the internal angle of friction. It was found that as the particle size distribution is made wider, the magnitude of the internal angle of friction increases. Angle of repose simulations were performed in order to verify the internal angles of friction results. It is found that the angles of repose measured are in rough agreement with, but slightly higher than, the values found for the internal angles of friction in the biaxial tests. Finally, biaxial tests were performed on assemblies in which bonds were introduced between the particles in order to simulate an intact ice cover. Results were consistent with a cohesive Mohr-Coulomb material.</description><creator>Corriveau, Daniel.</creator><contributor>Savage, S. B.

These events have occurred in the Sydney coal field, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, where they have resulted in injury and economic hardship. Because these phenomena are life threatening and not well understood and because geophysical methods have been identified as a means of studying these phenomena, an intrinsically safe microseismic monitoring system and method suitable for underground coal mines has been developed to gather information about these events. This thesis documents research encompassing the design and development of the intrinsically safe coal mine portable microseismic system (CPMS), and its application to outburst research in coal mine development headings advanced in virgin ground, where the phenomena have occurred. The CPMS has provided an increased understanding of the rock gas outburst phenomena in the Sydney coal field by recording various mining activity related seismicity and by partially recording the first rock gas outburst in an advance development headings driven by machine. Monitoring is continuing in a development heading driven by the drill and blast method in an attempt to capture rock gas outburst precursory information and more rock gas outbursts events which are required to more clearly define the mechanisms involved.</description><creator>Corbett, Gary Robert.</creator><contributor>Hassani, F.

In these cases, the utilization of the Eulerian formulations of the Euler equations of motion, may lead to long iterative computations for successive shapes of the boundaries, until the final geometry is reached. For this type of problems, the Lagrangian formulations using the streamline coordinates are more suitable, since the geometrically-unspecified boundaries are always represented by streamlines. Computational methods based on Lagrangian formulations have been recently developed for supersonic flows for the solution of the system of Euler equations. These Lagrangian formulations use the stream-function and the Lagrangian-time or -distance coordinates. In our present study, the numerical method applied to solve aerodynamic problems of unspecified geometry, is based on a finite volume discretization in the Lagrangian coordinates (stream-function and Lagrangian-distance), in which the flux values are determined by using the Riemann problem solution. Improvements leading to a better resolution of the shock waves are included. The method has been first validated for nozzles and airfoils of specified geometry, by comparison with analytical results and previous solutions obtained using Eulerian formulations. Then, the method has been applied for the solution of the above mentioned problems of unspecified geometry. In the cases of the flexible-membrane airfoils and the jet-flapped airfoils, an analytical solution has been developed in addition to the numerical solution.</description><creator>Chocron, Lionel.</creator><date>1996</date><subject>Engineering, Aerospace.</subject><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Analysis of aerodynamic problems of unspecified geometry based on a Lagrangian computational method</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hm50tt60t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4f16c465h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sq87bw50b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:05:54Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis describes the design and implementation of a real-time system for tracking moving people in an indoor environment. The system utilizes a stationary camera which can be mounted in any location within the indoor environment such as on a wall or the ceiling. Embodied in the system is a control mechanism which is based on a biological model of gaze control. This mechanism controls the movements of software windows which are used for tracking, such that the target is always centred within a window, in much the same way as human eyes move such that a target is always centred on the foveal region of the retina. Results from tracking experiments show that the implemented system is capable of tracking both single and multiple targets in real-time, with the camera placed at different heights above the floor. Furthermore, the system performs just as well under different lighting conditions. The tracking system requires no special hardware for its operation. All that is required is an off-the-shelf processor, camera, and frame-grabber. Therefore, the system provides a cost-effective solution for many applications which involve tracking such as security surveillance, robot navigation, and (human) traffic analysis.</description><creator>Cheung, Owen Ou Loung.</creator><contributor>Levine, M.

The uplink of the IS-95 cellular CDMA standard is an example of such a system. In this work, we develop a criterion to measure the merits of a waveform shaping filter from the points of view of interference reduction and bandwidth occupancy. This criterion allows us to derive quasi optimal waveforms. It is shown, for example, that the pulse shaping filter of the IS-95 standard is close to optimal. We also show, in the first part of this thesis, that pseudo random sequence spreading is an inefficient way of expanding bandwidth. Indeed, we prove that the optimal sharing of bandwidth spreading between PN sequences and error control coding is obtained when all the spreading is due to the error control code. The role of PN sequences for user separation is not diminished, while the system benefits from the added coding gain. In order to realize as much as possible of the potential coding gain, good very low rate codes are needed. The second part of this thesis focuses on the design of specific low rate error control codes for CDMA systems. We consider a new coding scheme, based on the combination of trellis codes and first-order Reed-Muller codes. We develop two families of codes based on this scheme, and study their performance both analytically and through simulations. We find the performance of our codes to be superior to that of other families of very low rate codes, such as the orthogonal, biorthogonal, and superorthogonal convolutional codes, and the error control code specified in the IS-95 standard.</description><creator>Chaib, J.

Traditional approaches to management methods for planning and control of projects are examined, and potential problem areas are identified. An alternative approach, continuous approval methods, is developed. The potential for improved productivity is demonstrated. The acquisition of defence systems in the Department of National Defence (DND) is used to provide examples of complex engineered-to-order projects. The DND study showed how continuous approval methods improved DND's existing engineered-to-order processes with a reduction in both delivery time and cost.

This creates the need for perceptual grouping, or the association of those fragments corresponding to the same object. Perceptual grouping is currently a bottleneck to computer vision, since previous approaches either were heuristic, assumed the object belonged to restricted classes in order to exploit geometric invariants, or hypothesized boundary continuations. I introduce an alternative by invoking the principle that those fragments should be grouped whose fragmentation can be accounted for by a virtual occluder, and introduce the gap skeleton as a representation of this occluder. Properties of gap skeleton are proved, and an algorithm for computing it is given. Finally, a different perspective on gap skeleton is obtained in the domain of shape decomposition, where ligature emerges as the analog to gap skeleton. This leads to a new definition of a limb as a formal part, and suggests that both grouping and shape decomposition share a common basis.</description><creator>August, Jonas.</creator><contributor>Zucker, Steven W.

The purpose of this study was to gain knowledge in how shell geometry affects the performance of the shell relative to liner structural characteristics and impact conditions. Samples, representing a section of a hockey helmet, consisted of a shell with one of nine geometric formations (width and angle), and a liner (Dertex or EPP). Each sample was impacted three times at three different levels of energy using a monorail drop test. Significant differences were observed for all main effects and two-way interactions for both liner types. Overall the 90 degree angle and 16mm width performed the best. It was found that geometry influences the elastic properties of the shell in a very specific way.
