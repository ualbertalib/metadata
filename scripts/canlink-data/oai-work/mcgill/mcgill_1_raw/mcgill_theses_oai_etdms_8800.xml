It involves the external anatomy of the adult beetle, the reproductive system and the digestive tract. A discussion of the evolution of the Rhyncbophorous head is given in which the controversial points of various workers are mentioned. An explanation of the hypostoma and the tentorium is given aecording to the writer's interpretation. The thoracic segments are discussed from an outer and an inner aspect. The mesotergum is peculiar in its enlarged precosta and prescutum and specialized scutum and scutellum. The abdomen presents the most important sexual characters which are found in the location and shape of the seventh and eighth terigites. In the female, 8 Is covered by 7, and forms the so-called "pygidium" while in the male 8 is distinct and together with 7 forms the so-called "divided pygidium". It is thought that the ninth and tenth tergites and the ninth and tenth sternites are represented in the sclerotized elements of the reproductive organs. The appendages ot the body are figured with their means of articulation explained. [...]</description><creator>Richmond, Hector Allan.</creator><contributor>DuPorte, E.

After a discussion of the vexed question of motor vehicle taxation and of the various means which might be taken to meet the growing competition from motor transport, it is concluded that the rationalisation of railway services (closer co-operation between our two great railway systems, or even their complete amalgamation, and the adoption of new units of railway rolling stock, such as the rail-car and oil-electric train), and the initiation of supplementary and auxiliary highway services by the railways offer the only practical solution.

"Plants of a less durable texture1", he states, "as they abound with a greater proportion of Salt and Water, which is not so strongly attractingas sulphur and air, so are they less able to resist the cold; and as plants are observed to have a greater proportion of Salt and Water in them in the spring, than in the autumn,so are they more easily injured by cold in the spring, than in a more advanced age, when their quantity of oil is increased, with their greater maturity".

For all that, however, about the only thing we know on the majority of those insects, is what has been written in the original description. Indeed, in Amerlica, apart from some species belonging to the genus Dendroctonus which have been quite well worked out, most of the others were rather considered as of secondary economic importance and their study has been neglected.

Each nation has been desperately trying to give away its goods by bounties mn exports, depreciation of the currency and a lowering of the general wage-scale while at the same time endeavouring to stop the incoming flow of goods across its frontiers by means of quotas, sanitary regularions and ever-mounting tariffs. The net result of all thi s has been a definitely poorer world. [...]</description><creator>Clark, Edgar Harrison.</creator><contributor>Hemmeon, J.

(2) Cauliflower Leaf Spot, caused by Bacterium maculicola (McC.) McCulloch. (3) Black Rot of Crucifers, caused by Bacterium campestre (Pam.) E.F.S. (4) Fireblight of Apples and Pears, caused by Bacillus amylovorus (Burrill) Trevisan. (5) Bacterial Blight of Bean, caused by Bacterium phaseoli E.F.Smith. (6) Beet Leaf Spot, caused by Cercospora beticola Sacc. The most important findings were in connection with cicatrice formation. In (2) and (6) active disease resistance responses, including occlusion of the intercellular spaces and, under warm Bonditions, the formation of wound cork round the lesions, were observed. In the remaining diseases active resistance responses were not noted except in a few cases which appeared to be abnormal. Wounding tests on leaves of cauliflower, turnip, cabbage, bean and beet indicated their ability to form wound cork similar to that formed round disease lesions. [...]</description><creator>Savile, D.

The five visits of Loti to Turkey are discussed, particularly in their relationship to the influence they have on the character and mental outlook of the man. Loti's impressions of Turkey, its people, their social customs and their religion are compared with those of contemporary writers on Turkey. Finally, the description of the Turkish women and her life in the harem as depicted in "Les Desenchantees", is considered, and the question discussed as to whether it is truly representative of the Turkish woman of that day.</description><creator>Rexford, Laura H.</creator><contributor>Du Roure, R.
