The model was used to study the effects of massive l.P. administration of donor material at and after transplantation. Both fresh cellular homogenates and freeze-stored ultrasonicated material prolonged renal allograft survival as long as the preparations were donor specific. The mechanism of action was related to soluble donor material that escaped macrophage processing, using the principle of biological filtration to support this hypothesis. The localized graft-versus-host reaction (Elkins' model) confirmed and amplified the findings, and the concept of tolerogenic transplantation antigens was proposed.</description><creator>Taguchi, Yoshinori.</creator><contributor>Dossetor, J.

The cardinal feature of this reaction is the formation of tumorous mass of proliferating donor mononuclear cells that invade and destroy the host renal cortex. This xenogeneic graft-versus-host reaction (XGVHR) is specifically inhibited by antilymphocyte sera (ALS) raised against the donor lymphoid cells. The degree of inhibition of ALS is proportional to the number of donor lymphocytes injected as well as the amount of antilymphocyte serum given to each recipient. In addition, it was found that the capacity of antilymphocyte sera to inhibit this XGVHR correlated with their ability to inhibit the rejection of skin allografts. In other words, the capacity of ALS to inhibit this XGVHR does correlate with their immunosuppressive potency. Xenogeneic graft-versus-host reactions produced by human lymphocytes in rats are used as a basis for assaying the immunosuppressive potency of anti-human lymphocyte sera prior to their clinical use.</description><creator>Saleh, Wasfy S.</creator><contributor>MacLean, L.

Appropriate conditions for phage induction, propagation, and storage were studied. A set of sensitive streptococcal strains was established for lysogeny screening. The morphology of the temperate and virulent phages of group A streptococci was studied by electron microscopy and compared with that of the phages of group C streptococci. Computer image processing of the electron photomicrographs revealed subunit structures not otherwise evident. The lytic phage cycle including phage attachment to streptococci, intracellular development, and phage release was followed by electron microscopy. Observations were made on alterations in biological activity of phages due to host-induced modifications. A defective phage was identified by biological and electron microscopic techniques. The role of streptococcal phages in transduction was studied using antibiotic resistance as a marker. Some of the factors of importance to transduction of streptomycin resistance were examined in detail.</description><creator>Read, Stanley E.</creator><contributor>Reed, R.

Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase and consequently blocks one carbon fragment metabolism. In Ehrlich ascites cells methotrexate depresses the rate of formate-14C labelling of purine nucleotides, RNA and serine. Deoxyuridine and deoxycytidine, both of which can give rise to thymidylate and therefore lead to dihydrofolate formation, cause an increased inhibition of formate-14C metabolism by methotrexate. Addition of 5-fluorodeoxyuridine, which is phosphorylated to 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate an inhibitor of thymidylate synthetase, or addition of thymidine, reverse the inhibitory action of deoxyuridine plus methotrexate on one carbon fragment metabolism. Additional evidence suggests that the thymidylate synthetase reaction can regulate the intracellular level of dihydrofolate and hence regulate the effects of methotrexate on the one carbon fragment metabolism of ascites tumor cells in vitro.</description><creator>Perrone, John R.</creator><contributor>Scholefield, P.

Analgesics such as aspirin, acetanilide and morphine (10^-4 - 10^-2M) and the adrenergic blocking agent bretylium toaylate (l0^-7 - l0^-5M) exhibited both potentiation and inhibition of release of the markers from the four particles, depending on the concentrations used.

The effect of prior administration of two classes of 7S mouse anti-sheep red blood cell (SRBC) immunoglobulins on the primary immune response to SRBC was studied. Mouse gammaGl and gammaG2 immunoglobulins were isolated from serum by a combination of Pevikon-Geon zone electrophoresis followed by density gradient isoelectric focusing. The immunoglobulins were defined by qualitative and quantitative studies, and their effects on the primary response were determined by administering doses ranging from 0.5 mg to 0.001 mg of immunoglobulin two hours before injection of antigen. Specific gammaGI (gammaF) anti-SRBC antibody suppressed the primary response to SRBC at all concentrations. Specific gammaG2 (gammaG) anti-SRBC antibody suppressed at high concentrations, but with less efficiency than gammaGl antibody, and enhanced the response to SRSC at low concentrations. The suppressing and enhancing effects of the passively administered immunoglobulins were shown to be specific. The effect of mixtures of gammaGl and gammaG2 antibodies was intermediate between values obtained when each was given alone. The results suggest that the suppressive effect of anti-SRBC antibody is associated predominantly, if not entirely, with gammaGl antibody, and the enhancing activity is associated with gammaG2 antibody. The significance of these findings relative to the postulated mechanisms of action of antibody mediated suppression of the immune response is discussed.</description><creator>Murgita, Robert A.</creator><contributor>Vas, S.

These events are initiated within the first five minutes as shown by the effect of EDTA on phosphorus release. Lipopolysaccharide inhibited this reaction suggesting that the lipopolysaccharide-lipoprotein membrane was the primary target. RNA and DNA synthesis was affected shortly after as shown by incorporation of 3H-uridine and 3H-thymidine, respectively. Incorporation of glycerol-2-3H into membrane lipid ceased after 25 minutes probably due to formation of lesions as indicated by decrease in optical density. Respiratory function (measured by manometric techniques) and protein synthesis (measured by incorporation of 14C-leucine) were subsequently affected. The bactericidal effect was influenced by the medium used. A complex nutrient medium decreased susceptibility as compared to a simple medium. The energy sources, glycerol and acetate, also decreased susceptibility. In addition, fresh serum enhanced agglutination by antibody rendering plate counts unreliable as the sole indicator of the bactericidal effect.</description><creator>Melching, Lee.</creator><contributor>Vas, S.

A purification procedure involving fractionation by streptomycin, protamine sulfate, Sephadex G-150 and DEAE-cellulose was employed. The enzyme required a divalent cation and a phosphate donor for activity. The presence of mercuric ions inhibited the enzyme. The molecular weight of dAR kinase was determined by gel filtration to be about 63,000. ATP, GTP, UTP and dTTP were all capable of serving as phosphate donors. dAR, deoxyguanosine (dGR) and cytidine (CR) but not deoxycytidine were shown to be substrates for the enzyme. The enzyme was subject to inhibition by adenine, guanine, and cytosine deoxynucleoside 5'-mono-, di- and triphosphates as well as by the phosphorylated derivatives of cytosine arabinosine and cytidine. The Km values for dAR, dGRand CR were 7.4 x 10-4 M, 1.1 x 10-3 M and 6.3 x 10-4 M respectively and each was found to competitively inhibit the other. The inhibition produced by dATP, dGTP, dCTP, CTP and araCTP appeared to be competitive with respect to ATP and non competitive with respect to dAR.</description><creator>Krygier, Vivian.</creator><contributor>Momparler, R.

The results obtained indicated the involvement of three different mechanisms in the release of labelled lipoprotein-bound phospholipids: 1: release of de nova synthesized lipoproteins. 2: exchange of liver phospholipids with circulating lipoproteins. 3: acceptance of phospholipids by a protein of d&gt;1.21 with the resultant decrease in its density. The latter protein(s) did not affect the release of labelled lipid as very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). It was found that heparin did not precipitate ail of the labelled phospholipids from the d&lt;1.006 fraction of the incubation medium. Using electrophoretic and immunological techniques it was shown that heparin dissociated the VLDL into heparin precipitable and heparin soluble lipoprotein components containing the beta- and alpha-lipoproteins respectively. The latter is known to carry most of the circulating phospholipids. The dissolved and dialyzed heparin precipitate of human VLDL recombined with the heparin supernatant to form a lipoprotein having the density, electrophoretic and immunological properties of native VLDL. The synthesis and release of the labelled lipid and protein moieties of VLDL by rat liver perfused with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution were studied using the heparin precipitation technique. The results c1early indicated that the VLDL polypeptide complex is assembled and released from the liver cell intact, and that the beta- and alpha-lipoproteins containing components of VLDL show a completely different metabolic pattern from each other and from those of the low and high density lipoproteins respectively.</description><creator>Kook, Abraham I.</creator><contributor>Rubinstein, D.

For their isolation and characterization, reagins were adsorbed specifically onto specially synthesized ragweed immunosorbents and eluted with glycine-HCl at pH 2.5, or 2M NaI at pH 9.l, or 6M urea at pH 7.4. The presence of human or rabbit serum protein was required for maximal recovery of reaginic activity. The specific elution of a portion of reagins was accomplished with hapten-like constituents of ragweed pollen. An identification of the antigenic determinants characteristic of reagins as those of the IgE class of immunoglobulins was made from antisera produced by the immunization of animals with the reaginic eluates. The heterogeneity and diversity of the allergen-reagin system was demonstrated with respect to (i) the antigenic and allergenic composition of ragweed pollen extracts, (ii) the specificities of reagins, and (iii) the skin-fixation property of reagins. A relationship of the reactivity of allergens with reagins was established on the basis of their electrical charges. Attempts to develop a method for the treatment of allergic individuals by inactivation of reagins in vivo with mercaptan were shown to be partially successful in a model system using monkeys sensitized intradermally with human reaginic serum.</description><creator>Kisil, Fred T.</creator><contributor>Sehon, A.

The enzyme was stabilized by inhibition of proteolytic contaminants with FDP and purified by phosphocellulose chromatography. A column chromatographic method was developed for the fractionation of oligonucleotides according to chain length up to the pentadecanucleotide level. Methods of fractionation according to base composition were developed for nucleosides and nucleotides, all possible non-isomeric dinucleotides and 14 of the 20 possible non-isomeric trinucleotides. The specificity of the enzyme was studied by analysis of the 5' or 3' termini of the oligonucleotides released during the digestion. DN'ase A was shown to change its specificity of cleavage during the several stages of native DNA hydrolysis when activated by cations such as Mg++, Mn++, Ni++, Sr++ and Zn++. The dpA-pN bond has been found to be highly resistant during the advanced phases of hydrolysis.

Survival of the animals after ischemic liver injury could be predicted by measuring the levels of lactate, inorganic phosphate and adenine nucleotides in the hepatic tissue. Measurements of high energy phosphate compounds and study of mitochondrial respiratory function in the revascularized liver helped to predict the consequent survival or death of the animal. The maximum safe period of temporary hepatic inflow stasis was prolonged by maintaining a minimum blood flow to the liver along collateral vessels in the gastrohepatic omentum. Liver tolerance to hepatic ischemia was prolonged by pretreating the animals with prednisolone, chlorpromazine or promethazine. It was shown that the acid phosphatase released into the systemic circulation after ischemic hepatic injury was not principally of lysosomal origin.</description><creator>Farkouh, Edward F.</creator><contributor>MacLean, L.

The intestinal mucosa tolerated high flow cardiac bypass well, although non-pulsatile blood flow reduced mucosal perfusion and increased vascular resistance. However. the intestinal mucosa was highly vulnerable to excessive hemodilution, low cardiac output and shock. Sequential histological study revealed progressive lifting of the mucosal epithelium, and the pace of the damage was found to be flow-dependent. Correlation with the results of metabolic study indicated that such epithelial lifting might constitute a transport barrier at the epithelial-capillary interface. Supplying an energy substrate (glucose) from the luminal side protected the intestine from ischemia. Restoration of blood flow to the intestine damaged by ischemia may cause circulatory collapse. Volume deficit appears to play the major role, contrary to the commonly held view that toxins are more important. Finally, the concept of epithelial lesions in low flow states involving multiple organs is discussed in perspective.</description><creator>Chiu, Chu-Jeng.</creator><contributor>Scott, H.

A radioimmunoassay for neurophysin has been developed, and also used for immunological studies of different components of neurophysin. A new component of norcine neurophysin, designated peptide IV, has been isloated, which is similar to the porcine neurophysin standard, peptide II, in amino acid composition, molecular weight and immunological reactivity, but different in electrophoretic mobility. The concentration of neurophysin increases progressively from the hypothalamus along the pituitary stalk to the posterior lobe. Different components of neurophysin in one or between species differ slightly in molecular weight, but vary considerably in electrophoretic mobility and immunological reactivity. Neurophysin has been identified in serum, and for the first time the physiological factors affecting serum concentrations of neurophysin have been established. Serum neurophysin of pigs and rats appears similar to neurophysin in the posterior lobe. In rats, procedures which lead to a reduction in blood volume or an increase in osmolality produce an increase in serum neurophysin, such as dehydration and hemorrhage.</description><creator>Cheng, Gavin K.</creator><contributor>Friesen, H.

Temporal relations between the noise and syllable ranging between 600 msec before to 150 msec within the syllable, and six different noise spectra, comprising one wide-band and five octave-bands, were used. Two noise sound pressure levels, 88 dB and 96 dB, and six syllable levels, comprising seven S/N ratios between -22 dB and -50 dB were investigated. Listening tests were conducted on two groups of ten subjects with normal hearing. Results demonstrated masking from noise-bursts 150 msec before to 150 msec after the beginning of the syllable. Consistent relations were found between the noise spectra and both masking and substitution errors for different consonants. Differences as a function of talkers and vowels were also observed.</description><creator>Charan, Kirti K.</creator><contributor>Doehring, D.

Semi-thin Epon sections were stained with PA-Schiff-iron-hematoxylin and radioautographed. The existence of three cell lines was established: vacuolated columnar, mucous and enterochromaffin. In the vacuolated-columnar cell line, only vacuolated cells divide. A vacuolated cell at the cryptal base and its progeny would go through three mitotic cycles in the lower two-thirds of the crypt before becoming columnar cells. In the mucous cell line, cells originate from vacuolated cells in the lower one-third of the crypt and undergo one or two mitotic cycles before ceasing to divide. Enterochromaffin cells do not divide, but renew by differentiation of vacuolated cells. The proliferative rate of epithelial cells undergoes diurnal variation, which affects mucous cells more seriously than vacuolated cells. All epithelial cells migrate upward along the cryptal wall, and eventually are lost from the surface.</description><creator>Chang, William W.</creator><contributor>Leblond, C.

Vitamin K analogues having vitamin K-like or antagonist activity in intact animals, showed the same activity in vitro. In slices from vitamin K-deficient rats, low concentrations of warfarin (&lt; 10^-4M) completely inhibited the response to low concentrations of vitamin K1 (&lt; 10^-6M) without inhibiting total protein synthesis. Concentrations of warfarin which were found to inhibit total protein synthesis (&gt;10^-4M), were required in order to inhibit the response to larger concentrations of vitamin KI (&gt;10^-5M) in slices from vitamin K-deficient or from warfarin-pretreated rats. The inhibition by warfarin of both factor VII release and protein synthesis is considered to be non-specific.

These changes were reversible, they were observed after fixation with osmium or acrolein solutions of varied osmotic strength, and they were unaffected by ouabain. Caffeine opposed both the reticular and fibre volume changes. The calculated volume of the reticulum was linearly related with a negative slope to the reciprocal of the osmotic pressure, closely approximating the volume behavior of an intra-fibre sucrose compartment postulated on the basis of earlier studies on the osmotic properties of frog muscle. It was proposed on the basis of these findings that the sarcoplasmic reticulum forms an extracellular compartment, and that passive water movements are responsible for its volume changes. The relevance of these findings to the nature of excitation-contraction coupling was discussed.</description><creator>Davey, David F.</creator><contributor>Birks, R.

On the basis of l4C02 production from glucose-1-14C as well as l4C incorporation from glucose-l-, -2-, and -6-14C into nucleotide ribose it was concluded that net pentose phosphate production from glucose proceeds by the simultaneous operation of the oxidative and non-oxidative pathways. The latter pathway also contributes extensively to l4C incorporation from glucose-l4c into pentose phosphate as a result of ex change reactions. Time course studies of adenine-8- l4C incorporation into nucleotides in the presence of glucose, different concentrations of R5P and/or PRPP, as well as preincubation studies with glucose suggest that R5P or a metabolite thereof initially inhibits nucleotide synthesis for 5-10 minutes, but as the concentration of PRPP in the medium is increased, this inhibition is reversed. The ratio of 14C incorporation from glucose-l-, and -6-l4C into nucleotide ribose by the sonicate in the presence of 1 mM glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) is similar to the ratio cited for the intact cell. It is suggested that the G3p concentration in the intact cell in part regulates the relative labelling pattern of nucleotide ribose from glucose-14C.</description><creator>Schiff, Nathan.</creator><contributor>Scholefield, P.

Using the disease acatalasemia and a strain of acatalasemic mice, catalase-loaded microcapsules have been introduced in-vivo as a means of enzyme, replacement. Both catalase in free solution and microencapsulated catalase were efficient in replacing the deficient enzyme in a single trial injection. However, repeated injection of the catalase solution resulted in the production of antibodies to the foreign prote in (enzyme). These immunized acatalasemic mice suffered hypersensitivity reactions when challenged with the foreign enzyme. On the other hand, repeated injection of catalase-loaded microcapsules did not induce antibody formation in the mice and did not produce any hypersensitivity reactions.

The electron microscopic findings were subjected to quantitative morphometric analysis. To obtain further quantitative data, biochemical estimations of hepatic glycogen, glucose-6-phosphatase, acid phosphatase, and blood glucose were made. Inhibition of glycogen breakdown was associated with inhibition of the normal increase in vesicular elements of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, a failure bf the normal rise in glucose-6-phosphatase and an inhibition of lysosome formation. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum played no role in glycogen breakdown in these cells. The glycogen content of the autophagic vacuoles correlated positively with the glycogen of the hyaloplasm.

The ability of these mutants to accumulate beta-alanine allowed the identification of an active transport system for this substrate. Competition studies led to the proposal of a common transport site for beta-alanine, alpha-L-alanine and L-proline, as well as specific sites for the latter two amino acids. This proposal was confirmed by a study of FDNB inactivation of the transport and by studies on the specificity of a cryptic mutant. Expression of permease levels in this organism is coupled to the growth rate. A mutant lacking the common system was isolated. This mutant can catalyze facilitated diffusion and exchange, but cannot concentrate substrates of the transport system.
