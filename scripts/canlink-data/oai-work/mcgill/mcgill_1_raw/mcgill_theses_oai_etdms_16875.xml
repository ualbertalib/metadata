Experimental surgery, as a branch of surgery, was at that time in its beginnings, both at McGill University and in other centers on this continent. It is, therefore, not surprising that several serious technical difficulties have prevented the completion of the proposed research at that time. The results of the investigation recorded in this thesis have been obtained during the session 1946-1947, and completed during the current session.</description><creator>Madore, Patrick.</creator><contributor>Robertson, H.

Three important types of primary aberrations have been investigated separately, spherical aberration, coma, and astigmatism.

In the case of the sympathetic system, ergot was used as early as 1906 by Dale, who then supplied an accurate description of what we know as 'adrenergic blockade'. This pharmacological effect may be defined as the blockade of responses to adrenaline, nor-adrenaline and other sympathomimetic amines and to sympathetic nerve activity.
