purpose in life. The stress and coping literature suggest that the process of meaning-making provides a suitable framework to study such existential questions, as well as an ideal method of intervention. Through a series of manuscripts, this thesis examines the construct of meaning-making within the specific domain of cancer, describes the development of a meaning-making intervention, and assesses the impact of meaning-making coping on psychological adjustment to cancer. The recent proliferation of studies on the  concept of meaning that includes the adult cancer experience has been conceptualized and operationalized in a variety of ways. To better understand and use the meaning-making concept within the cancer experience, a systematic review of the literature was conducted to synthesize the current level of knowledge and determine where research should be directed. This review of the empirical and qualitative findings suggested that the successful  ability to construct a sense of meaning in illness may lead to positive psychological outcomes. Thus a novel meaning-making intervention (MMI) for cancer patients was developed, and its applicability as well as its effects on  psychological adjustment to cancer were explored in a pilot study with a heterogeneous group of patients. Significant improvements in self esteem and self-efficacy were reported in a small, uncontrolled sample and encouraged the need for further confirmatory testing. Guided by the pilot study results, a randomized controlled trial tested the effect of the MMI on levels of self-esteem, optimism, and self-efficacy in a homogeneous sample of newly diagnosed breast or colorectal cancer patients. After controlling for baseline differences on each outcome variable, participants in the experimental group (n=35) who received the MMI were found to have significantly improved percep</description><creator>Lee, Virginia</creator><contributor>Cohen, S.

Small surgical removal of the anterior temporal region, including the entorhinal cortex, is not sufficient to interrupt that fronto-hippocampal relationship. More extensive removals, however, that include a sizeable portion of the hippocampus and the surrounding parahippocampal cortex do disrupt such a fronto-hippocampal functional interaction (Petrides and Milner, 1982). Based on these data, it was postulated that the fronto-hippocampal functional interaction is not entirely dependent upon the integrity of the entorhinal cortex. To test this hypothesis, injections of tritiated amino acids were placed within individual cytoarchitectonic units of the frontal cortex, and the resulting labeling in the hippocampal region was analyzed. It was shown that the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex, together with its medial cortical extension, is the only frontal region that sends efferent fibers, running caudally as part of the cingulum bundle, to the presubiculum, the posterior parahippocampal gyrus, as well as to the retrosplenial cortex. A light contingent of these fibers, congregating in the outermost layer of both the retrosplenium and the presubiculum, course into the molecular layer of the hippocampus proper. In complete agreement with the work with patients, these findings have confirmed the hypothesis that the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex is closely affiliated with the hippocampal system, and demonstrated that this hodological relationship bypasses the entorhinal cortex. Another major contribution of the present work has been to provide the first architectonic analysis of a gross morphological region, referred to as the caudomedial lobule, which receives inputs from the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex and its medial extension. This architectonic analysis has revealed that the caudomedial lobule is nothing but the postero-ventral extension, below the splenium of the corpus callosum, of areas 29 and 30, which together form the retrosplenial cortex, and of area 23, which partly forms the posterior cingulate cortex. Among the cortical fields that comprise the postero-ventral part of the retrosplenial cortex, area 30 is the major recipient of the mid-dorsolateral frontal inputs. By virtue of the close anatomical relation of area 30 with the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex and its medial extension, it is suggested that this part of the retrosplenial cortex may be a critical relay-station along the dorsomedially directed fronto-hippocampal pathway. In order to validate this hypothesis, the connections of area 30 were investigated by placing injections of anterograde and retrograde tracers within the limits of this retrosplenial area. This study has demonstrated that area 30 is bi-directionally connected with and only with that part of the lateral frontal cortex that lies above the sulcus principalis, namely the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex, along with all the structures of the posterior hippocampal region that are the recipients of the inputs from the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex. Since the fronto-hippocampal association fiber system described in the present thesis is most probably subserving certain aspects of working memory, area 30, by virtue of its bi-directional connections with both the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex and the posterior parahippocampal cortex, is in a privileged position to exert a major influence in working memory processing.</description><creator>Morris, Renée.</creator><contributor>Petrides, Michael (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><subject>Biology, Anatomy.</subject><title>The association fiber system linking the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex with the retrosplenial cortex and the posterior hippocampal region in the rhesus monkey /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/08612q15m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t148fj637</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:47429b71w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:06:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The ferrichrome-iron receptor FhuA is located in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli. To probe the topological organization of FhuA which enables it to recognize ferrichrome and other ligands, a library of 16 insertion mutations within the fhuA gene was generated. Each mutation spliced a 13-amino acid foreign antigenic determinant (the C3 epitope) at a different position within FhuA. Flow cytometric analysis of strains expressing the chimeric FhuA.C3 proteins indicated that insertion of the foreign sequence was tolerated at 12 of 16 sites: the FhuA.C3 proteins were properly localized in the outer membrane and still conferred sensitivity to FhuA-specific phages. Three FhuA.C3 proteins which carried the C3 epitope after amino acids 321, 405, or 417 displayed the foreign determinant in intact cells, indicating that these residues are surface-accessible in wild-type FhuA. To examine the accessibility of FhuA sequences and their contribution to ligand binding, a library of 35 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the FhuA protein was isolated and their reactivities characterized. Two groups of mAbs bound to FhuA in membrane vesicles but not to FhuA in cells, indicating that their determinants are exposed to the periplasm. Five mAbs bound strongly to FhuA on intact cells in flow cytometry, indicating that their determinants are surface-exposed. While no mAbs inhibited ferrichrome binding or cell killing by a FhuA-specific peptide antibiotic called microcin 25, certain mAbs prevented killing by colicin M and partially inhibited the inactivation of another FhuA-specific bacteriocidal agent, T5 phage. These data provided evidence for spatially distinct ligand binding sites on FhuA and for the tightly ordered organization of FhuA sequences which lie external to the outer membrane. To allow investigations into the secondary structure of the FhuA protein, the receptor was purified from the outer membrane of E. coli. Circular dichroism and infrared spectroscopy revealed a predominance of beta-sheet structure for the purified protein. The addition of ferrichrome to FhuA reduced the ability of certain mAbs to bind to the receptor. Results from trypsinolysis experiments and immunological assays indicated that the binding of ferrichrome induces a structural change in the receptor which is propagated across the outer membrane. By such an alteration of conformation, the inner membrane energy-coupling protein TonB is proposed to trigger the energization of active transport of bound ferrichrome across the outer membrane. To address this hypothesis, biochemical assays were conducted to examine the nature of the interaction between FhuA and TonB. Crosslinking experiments in vivo in the absence and presence of cognate ligand demonstrated that ferrichrome binding to FhuA increased the complexation between FhuA and TonB. The proposed mechanism explains how TonB could service a greater number of siderophore receptors in the outer membrane: TonB would interact preferentially with ligand-replete receptors. These studies now provide a plausible explanation for efficient energy transduction to enable high-affinity iron uptake by the cell.</description><creator>Moeck, Gregory S.</creator><contributor>Coulton, J.

In this study, biodegradable NANA analogs such as the polyelectrolytes Carboxymethylchitin (CMC) and Carboxymethyl/Glycolchitin (CO) have been adsorbed by physical adsorption onto the surface of positive and neutral liposomes. The dye Alcian Blue has been used to standardize the initial polymer concentration between unequally substituted polymer batches of the same molecular weight. The amount of polymer adsorbed on the surface of the liposomes can be quantified using chitinase from Streptomyces griseus (EC 3.2.1.14), provided that the polymeric substrate is first desorbed from the surface of the liposomes. A Factorial Design is used to optimize the adsorption conditions of CMC and CO onto 0.22 $ mu$m diameter liposomes in phosphate buffer saline (PBS, $ kappa$ = 154 mM, pH = 7.4). The molecular weight of the polymer ranges from $5.00 times 10 sp4$ to $1.20 times 10 sp6.$ Increasing the liposome diameter from 0.22 to 0.45 $ mu$m reduces the extent of polymer-induced aggregation in PBS buffer. Polymer adsorption results in disaggregation of liposome suspensions for all polymer-coated suspensions in plasma and blood. The theoretical stability ratios (W) obtained using the classical DLVO theory show that the CMC-coated liposomes are more stable than the CO-coated and stealth (DSPC:CHOL:DSPE-PEG2000,5:4:1) liposomes. Meanwhile, experimental values of W prove that the lipid-grafted stealth is the most stable suspension. Results of simulations of liposome-macrophage interactions show that the polymer-coated liposomes are not prone to uptake by macrophages prior and after plasma incubation. Measurements of zeta potential, calorimetry and plasma protein adsorption on stealth, polymer-coated and (DSPC:CHOL:DMPG, 5:4:1) ( (-)) liposomes show that for the polymer-coated liposomes the change in zeta p</description><creator>Mobed, Maryam.</creator><contributor>Chang, T.

Historically, this notion has given rise to a number of movements which have sought to ensure that religious beliefs and practices be restored and brought into harmony with the primary sources of Islam, the Qur'an and Sunnah. One of these movements was led by Ahmad Hassan (1887-1958), acknowledged by many as a great scholar and a tireless advocate of the need for renewal (tajdid) and reform (islah). This study analyses the significance of Hassan's role in the movement for Islamic legal reform and examines in particular his legal theory (usul al-fiqh) and its application to problems of substantive law (fiqh). In terms of Indonesia (and perhaps other regions as well), this is a new approach; for few works on Islamic law in Indonesia concerned with either the Islamic judicial system or substantive law devote any significant attention to usul al-fiqh, which, in fact, provides the foundation for these institutions, not to mention other aspects of Islamic teaching as well. As a reformer, Hassan was sometimes led to adopt bold, even extreme positions. He attacked his traditionalist opponents for placing too much faith in the doctrines of particular legal schools when seeking solutions to the problems faced by Muslims. Too often this led them to base their decisions on individual opinion, which placed them at a doble remove from the two primary sources. Instead Hassan advocated constant ijtihad, or at least ittiba', in the belief that the door had never been shut on direct analysis of scripture. In adopting this position, Hassan developed a sound, consistent and text-based approach to usul al-fiqh that was adopted after his death by his followers and students. Indeed, this approach has even had a substantial effect on his opponents, whose stance has changed subtly to reflect many of Hassan's concerns.</description><creator>Minhaji, Akh.</creator><contributor>Hallaq, Wael B.

Mainstream Canadian journalism's participation in these discourses is analyzed within the context of its cultural and structural integration into global media networks. Media materials are scrutinized using critical discourse, dramatistic, and ritual analysis methodologies. The thesis follows Hamid Mowlana's suggestion that inquiries into international communication flows should move beyond traditional paradigms of inter-national relations (in which nation-states are the primary objects of study) to consider intra- and transnational participants as well. Borrowing from Jacques Ellul, this study examines the importance of myth as a fundamental basis of communication. However, unlike Ellul, it also explores alternatives to the operations of dominant communication structures. Edward Said's critique of Orientalism informs the analysis of Northern portrayals of Muslim societies; but the dissertation attempts to avoid overstating the Orientalist discourses' hegemony by proposing a model of competition among dominant, oppositional and alternative discourses on "Islam." Mainstream media's adherence to dominant technological myths and their general reticence about the structural and direct violence of elite states are examined. Distinct similarities are found between the utopic orientations and technical operations of dominant Northern and Muslim discourses, as well as in Jewish, Christian and Muslim conceptions of holy/just war. The proliferation of contemporary Northern images about "Islam" are traced historically to four primary stereotypes about Muslims. Examinations of the supposedly objective and secularist media reportage on terrorism show differences in portrayal according to the perpetrators' religions. Analyses of the coverage of wars involving peoples of Muslim backgrounds in the Middle East, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the former USSR demonstrate the tendency of dominant journalistic scripts to attribute diverse political, economic and territorial conflicts to a monolithic "lslam" The dissertation traces how the global media narrative's transformation of Saddam Hussein from an ally of the West to a demonic despot was aided by according him "Islamic" characteristics. It also looks at the emergence of "Islam" as a post-Cold War Other. Lastly, proposals made by scholars and journalists for enhancing inter-cultural communication between Northern and Muslim societies are considered.</description><creator>Karim, Karim H.

Little is known about the effects of tillage practices and manuring on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of soil disturbance on winter survival, development and distribution of AMF in soil and on plant nutrient uptake and productivity. This research was conducted in long-term corn plots in two soils and under controlled conditions. A growth chamber study with field soil demonstrated that most of the fungal hyphae with mycorrhizal plants were mycorrhizal rather than saprophytic. This result was extrapolated to subsequent experiments. Soil disturbance reduced corn nutrient uptake and growth by disrupting the AMF hyphal network. Similarly, fallow periods reduced density of AMF hyphae, leading to reduced mineral nutrients uptake and plant growth. Soil disturbance was also found to severely reduce winter survival of AMF hyphae in agricultural soil. AM hyphae could survive the winter in soil, even when they were not attached to roots. Their survival however, was improved when they remained attached to roots. Under field conditions, indigenous AMF were more abundant in no-till soil, less abundant under reduced tillage and least abundant under conventional tillage. Under all tillage systems, most of AMF hyphae were located in the top 15 cm of the soil profile suggesting that deep plowing could result in dilution of AMF propagules in the seeding zone. There was a seasonal variation in the abundance of hyphae in soil. Soil hyphae and root colonization declined after the silking stage of corn. Hyphal abundance decreased further over the winter, to reach their lowest level in the spring. The spatial distribution of fungal hyphae in the field was not homogenous. Hyphal density was maximal directly under the corn rows and decreased linearly up to the mid-row. Marked seasonal variations in hyphal densities were observed on the row but fluctuations at mid-row were not significant suggesting that little AMF hyphae were ever present between the rows. Liquid dairy manure had little effect on the abundance of hyphae and spores.</description><creator>Kabir, Md. Zahangir.</creator><contributor>Fyles, J. W.

Mulches were either black, photoselective or clear. Rowcover systems included a clear perforated polyethylene, a polypropylene agrotextile, or unperforated polyethylenes (standard or infra-red treated) with a water-filled tube. In all tunnel types, the photoselective mulch had an intermediate effect between clear and black mulch on air and soil temperatures, chilling injury and days to flowering. Plants with a clear mulch and an infrared or standard unperforated tunnel with a thermal tube survived chilling temperatures between 1.6-5.8C for seven days, flowered first, had the heaviest biomass at anthesis and had the highest early yields. Plant dry weight from transplanting to anthesis was predicted from a multiple linear regression based on heat unit formulas using air (base temperature of 14C, maximum threshold of 40C) and soil temperatures (base temperature of 12C). The base temperature for predicting developmental time to anthesis of perfect flowers was 6.8C. In order to study fruit growth, a rapid and non-destructive method for estimating volume of ovaries was established. Fruit phenology was described as six classes for flower development and seven for fruit development. Flower abortion was studied in relation to each class. Plants displayed either one or two fruit growth cycles. The second cycle was triggered as the absolute growth rate of the first cycle fruits decreased. Developmental time of individual fruits was predicted from a heat unit formula with a base temperature of 15C when temperatures were recorded from a meteorological station. Another heat unit formula was proposed for air temperature at 7.5 cm. Fruit growth from the second cycle had a 60-degree day lag. Fruit volume proportion from blooming to maturity of first cycle fruits was described by a common Richards function.

The central question motivating this study is whether Habermas succeeds in this ambition. Discourse ethics specifies a procedure which purports to enable all agents involved in a conflict of interest in which issues of justice are at stake to come to a rational and cooperative resolution. It proposes a position unique among contemporary approaches to justice in the strength and character of its anti-relativist stance: the plurality of human cultures and the situated character of human understanding do not, according to this theory, bar the way to arriving at a minimal form of moral universalism. Although the procedure specified in communicative ethics elucidates only a narrow range of concerns--those pertaining to justice in the strict sense--it aims to do so in a way valid across all human cultures. Habermas's strategy for the defence of a species-wide moral universalism is, I argue, both the key feature of his position, and the least well understood. Discussion of discourse ethics to date has focussed almost exclusively on the question of its appropriateness to the context of modern, Western pluralism. An important reason for this focus has been the intricacy of Habermas's argumentative strategy, which links the recent work on discourse ethics to his longstanding project of developing a theory of communicative action. The principle aim of this thesis is to clarify Habermas's position by explicating his programme of justification. In so doing, I draw attention to several problems in his approach as a mechanism for cross-cultural conflict adjudication, and endeavour to provide a more perspicuous account of the relation of Habermas's theory to its main philosophical competitors, especially Rawlsian deontology, and contextualism.</description><creator>Johri, Mira.</creator><contributor>Taylor, Charles (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Ethics, Modern -- 20th century.</subject><subject>Habermas, Jürgen -- Ethics.</subject><title>On the universality of Habermas's discourse ethics</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/db78td63t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/td96k414h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Philosophy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q811km20n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:06:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In a Victorian Britain in crisis, Chartism was as it remains an exemplary site for contestation of various forms of authority--social, political, theological, historical, and literary. When Carlyle in his Chartism essay demands what "the under classes intrinsically mean," he discounts "these wild inarticulate souls" unable to recognize or express their own true state (122). But even as Carlyle authorizes detached observation, he also helps cement those unpredictable alliances that haunt his work. In an increasingly statistical culture, the representation of Chartism has much to tell about technologies of power, the cultural inflection of difference, and the production and reproduction of knowledge, value, and legitimacy. Thus, it seems timely to re-examine Chartism and its diverse representations within and beyond the so-called social-problem novel. Like other forms of knowledge production, the novel both helped shape and was reshaped by Chartism which tested to the limit the novel's pretension to adequate representation of a common world. Such investigation indicates the importance of interpretation despite its being attacked by everyone from political economists to postmodernists. I thus interpret Victorian reform through its literary mediations, and in relation to the kinds of authority and accounting associated with a history and theology in crisis. In reading for reform largely male middle-class experts, I deploy a double strategy, reading them to bring out the power and agency of the underrepresented, and realigning texts and contexts to reform the ways they are read. While Carlyle and Peter Gaskell defined the terms of succeeding debates on Chartism, they did not fully determine the interpretations of their own words or other pertinent evidence by the underclasses or by writers like Elizabeth Gaskell and Charles Kingsley. By the forms of their fiction, these two writers helped legitimate the lives and utterances of the working classes and exposed the class- and gender-based hierarchies of literary genres and social and political conventions. Elizabeth Gaskell and Kingsley rework such authoritative discourses as history and theology and reform reading and writing in ways that frustrate the efforts of literary taxonomists then and now, and accept the burden of interpretation to make a difference in the literary and social scene. By socializing and historicizing literary categories in the light of Mikhail Bakhtin and others, I aim to escape those intellectual "tramlines" that have constrained commentary. The careful generic and other demarcations and hierarchies of traditional critical discourse and unexamined allegiance to stable notions of class, gender, nation, and religion have operated against the disruptive power and productivity of the work of Gaskell and Kingsley. Equally, whereas historians like Dorothy Thompson turn to "empirical data" (Chartists x) to dispel the confusion of interpretations of Chartism, my practice is theoretical, as my story of the past is continuous with my understanding of the present. Even Gareth Stedman Jones (part of the linguistic turn in historical studies) cannot sufficiently rethink Chartism when he concedes determining force to government policy and Carlyle's terms, although he usefully shifts attention from the economic to the political. He operates, however, within a rigid binary logic that separates the social and political while underplaying the cultural and a range of linguistic practices and forms of dissemination that constituted Chartist identity.</description><creator>Findlay, Isobel.</creator><contributor>McSweeney, Kerry (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Gaskell, Elizabeth Cleghorn, 1810-1865 -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><subject>Kingsley, Charles, 1819-1875 -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><subject>Chartism.</subject><title>Reading for reform : history, theology, and interpretation and the work of Elizabeth Gaskell and Charles Kingsley</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xw42n9490.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q811km20n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nc580p05j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:06:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We investigated the role of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), and related intracellular second messengers, in the development of morphine tolerance and dependence. The mGluRs are divided into three groups: group I mGluRs are positively coupled to phosphatidylinositol (PI) hydrolysis, while group II and III mGluRs are negatively coupled to cyclic adensoine-3$ sp prime$,5$ sp prime$-monophosphate (cAMP) production. Opioid receptors are also coupled to these same systems, and have been shown to elicit changes in these messenger systems during chronic treatment. We showed that chronic intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of selective group II and III mGluR antagonists concurrently with subcutaneous (s.c.) morphine significantly reduced the severity of precipitated withdrawal symptoms. Conversely, acute i.c.v. injection of a selective group II mGluR antagonist just prior to the precipitation of withdrawal significantly exacerbated the severity of abstinence symptoms. In addition, acute i.c.v. injection of a selective group II mGluR agonist just prior to the precipitation of withdrawal significantly reduced abstinence symptoms. From these results we hypothesized that chronic opioid treatment may induce a desensitization of group II mGluRs. We also demonstrated that chronic i.c.v. infusion of a selective group I mGluR antagonist concurrently with s.c. morphine significantly attenuated the precipitated withdrawal syndrome. In addition, we showed that chronic i.c.v. antagonism of $ delta$-opioid receptors with a highly selective antagonist also decreased the development of morphine dependence, as well as tolerance. Since both group I mGluRs and $ delta$-opioid receptors are positively coupled to PI hydrolysis, further evidence for a role of products of PI hydrolysis in the development of morphine dependence was obtained when we showed that selective chronic inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) activation, as well as selective chronic inhibition of intracellular Ca$ sp{2+}$ release, concurrently with morphine treatment significantly reduced the severity of abstinence symptoms. Thus, compensatory changes usually elicited by chronic opioid treatment may be counteracted by antagonizing receptors positively coupled to PI hydrolysis, as well as by inhibiting products of PI hydrolysis. In the General Discussion, we propose a model based on the possible interaction of mGluRs and opioid receptors, via related intracellular second messengers, to explain the development of morphine dependence.</description><creator>Fundytus, Marian Elaine.</creator><contributor>Coderre, Terence J.

All three treatment regimes are effective against a range of parasites, and conventional wisdom at the start of the trial was that asymptomatic Trichuris infection is harmless and has no effect on growth. The hypothesis was that children treated with 3 doses of albendazole grow better than children treated with a single dose of albendazole who, in turn, grow better than children treated with pyrantel pamoate. The children were measured and treated at baseline and every 4 months over 12 months. In spite of the differential efficacy of the 3 treatments against Trichuris, there were no differences in overall increment in height, weight, and arm circumference between the three treatment groups. However, the children who received the 3 daily 400 mg regime of albendazole had a significantly lower increment in triceps skinfold thickness than those who received pyrantel pamoate. The children who had higher intensities of Trichuris at baseline and who received the single 400 mg albendazole regime grew more in height than children in the same treatment group with lower initial levels of infection. The increment in weight, arm circumference, and triceps skinfold thickness was also a positive function of the initial intensity of Trichuris infection in the children who received 3 daily 400 mg doses of albendazole. This study provides evidence that low, asymptomatic levels of Trichuris can impair growth, and suggests that either albendazole or pyrantel pamoate or both may have an effect on the growth of children, independent of a therapeuti</description><creator>Forrester, Janet Elizabeth.</creator><contributor>Bailar, John C., III (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Human Development.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</subject><title>The contribution of moderate to light Trichuris trichiura infection to growth impairment in children /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hx11xg42p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/td96k415s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7w62f989f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:06:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The basic goal of the Adaptive Optical Music Recognition system presented herein is to create an adaptive software for the recognition of musical notation. The focus of this research has been to create a robust framework upon which a practical optical music recognizer can be built. The strength of this system is its ability to learn new music symbols and handwritten notations. It also continually improves its accuracy in recognizing these objects by adjusting internal parameters. Given the wide range of music notation styles, these are essential characteristics of a music recognizer. The implementation of the adaptive system is based on exemplar-based incremental learning, analogous to the idea of "learning by example," that identifies unknown objects by their similarity to one or more of the known stored examples. The entire process is based on two simple, yet powerful algorithms: k-nearest neighbour classifier and genetic algorithm. Using these algorithms, the system is designed to increase its accuracy over time as more data are processed.</description><creator>Fujinaga, Ichiro.</creator><contributor>Pennycook, Bruce (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Optical character recognition devices.</subject><subject>Musical notation -- Data processing.</subject><title>Adaptive optical music recognition</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/47429b725.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7w62f989f</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z890rv95z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:06:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis investigates the second language acquisition of English psych predicates by Chinese-speaking and French-speaking adult learners of English within the Government and Binding Theory. Two major parts comprise the whole work: a study of psych predicates across Chinese, English and French, including verbs like blame and annoy, adjectives such as annoying and annoyed, and nominals like annoyance; and an experiment on Chinese and French learners' knowledge of English psych predicates. An account of psych predicates is proposed, under which Experiencer Object (EO) verbs are the causatives of Experiencer Subject (ES) verbs, derived by zero affixation. Different D-structures are suggested for the two classes of verbs, solving the linking problem of psych predicates. The binding problem with EO verbs and corresponding -ing adjectives is resolved by the assumption of anaphoric pro, which enables the anaphor to be bound backwards by the antecedent through the extension of chain-binding theory. The Target/Subject Matter (T/SM) restriction is ruled out by a generalization established on the interaction of the zero CAUS and selectional restrictions. Given the linguistic analysis that EO verbs are made up of a zero CAUS and a root, and the fact that psych adjectives and psych nominals are derived from these verbs, the central hypothesis for the L2 acquisition of English psych predicates hinges on this zero CAUS. It is predicted that if L2 learners of English have difficulty figuring out the causative nature of EO verbs and -ing adjectives, they should have difficulty recognizing the correct argument structure, the ungrammaticality of T/SM violations and the grammaticality of backwards binding with these predicates. A picture identification task, a multiple choice task and a grammaticality judgment and correction task are designed to test L2 learners' knowledge of these properties. The results obtained through the experiment are discussed with respect to the issues in second language acquisition.</description><creator>Chen, Dongdong, 1960-</creator><contributor>Travis, Lista (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>White, Lydia (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>English language -- Verb phrase.</subject><subject>English language -- Study and teaching -- Chinese speakers.</subject><subject>Second language acquisition.</subject><subject>English language -- Study and teaching -- French speakers.</subject><title>L2 acquisition of English psych predicates by native speakers of Chinese and French</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ff365678g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rv95z</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Linguistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:f1881n50r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:06:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Association between albendazole anthelmintic resistance and a panel of life history traits in Heligmosomoides polygyrus was investigated both prior to and during drug-selection. Associations prior to anthelmintic application were studied in ten independent lines isolated without drug treatment from a susceptible stock population by random genetic drift. Variation among lines was detected in several life history traits (i.e., establishment, development and survival), and, despite lack of previous exposure to albendazole, lines also varied in their tolerance to the drug. No significant correlations were detected between drug-tolerance and any of the life history traits after 11 generations of isolation. The apparent lack of fitness differential between lesser and more drug-tolerant individuals of the susceptible population is not in accordance with the assumption that the low frequency of drug tolerant individuals in the susceptible population is explained by their lower fitness, but is consistent with the neutral theory. Associations between life history traits and drug resistance were also studied using two lines selected for albendazole resistance from the stock population, and two control lines exposed to the same monthly passage procedure but not to the drug. After 10 generations of selection, drug resistance increased from an LC50 of 0.48 $ mu$M to 2.03 $ mu$M. In a primary infection, the higher establishment and higher worm numbers one-month post-infection in the resistant parasites compared to the stock parasites occurred only in the drug-selected lines. Changes in these traits were attributed to the drug selection regime. In contrast, both drug-selected lines and passaged lines showed a faster rate of development and higher early egg production compared with the stock parasites; these changes were attributed to the passage procedure that presumably acted as a selective force on early life history traits. In immunized hosts, changes in several traits that o</description><creator>Chehresa, Azita.</creator><contributor>Scott, Marilyn E.

To elucidate the function of MPTP-PEST, several biological aspects of the protein were investigated. It was determined that the MPTP-PEST enzyme is a stable cytosolic protein tyrosine phosphatase of 112 kDa that is ubiquitously expressed both in the adult and in the embryo. MPTP-PEST is composed of a single amino-terminus catalytic domain which is active against phosphorylated substrates in vitro. The gene structure and chromosomal localization of MPTP-PEST were determined using a series of $ lambda$ phage clones isolated from a mouse genomic library. Analysis of the MPTP-PEST locus indicated that the gene spans over 90 kb of the mouse genome and is composed of 18 exons, 10 of which constitute the catalytic phosphatase domain. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with MPTP-PEST genomic DNA defines the map position of MPTP-PEST to mouse chromosome 5 region A3-B. To gain mechanistic insights into the function of MPTP-PEST, the association of proteins with MPTP-PEST was investigated using several different in vitro and in vivo binding assays. It was shown that the proto-oncoprotein SHC and the adaptor protein Grb2 associate with MPTP-PEST through specific carboxy-terminus sequences. In addition, the SHC/MPTP-PEST association was shown to be mediated by a novel type of protein-protein interaction. Both SHC and Grb2 function downstream of receptor type and cyloplasmic protein tyrosine kinases and have been shown to mediate several signal transduction events. The association of MPTP-PEST with these signaling proteins may therefore represent a function for MPTP-PEST in signaling events.</description><creator>Charest, Alain.</creator><contributor>Tremblay, Michel (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Biochemical and genetic studies of the protein tyrosine phosphatase MPTP-PEST</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kh04dr15d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n009w3905</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5138jg35d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:06:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>It is commonly assumed that the development of tourist attractions, the formulation of tourism policies and the marketing of destination areas are dictated by the needs and interests of foreign visitors. What is ignored is the role that local factors and agencies bring to bear upon the process. This thesis is devoted to exploring the ways that local and non-local factors are responsible for shaping the form and function of tourism development. Drawing upon the case of Singapore, the thesis examines the country's heritage tourism phenomena as the outcome of 'local' and 'global' forces. This argument is elaborated along four lines of enquiry. They include a study of government policies on tourism, a look at entrepreneurs involved in heritage projects, an exploration of marketing and promotional strategies, and the examination of a particular urban landscape the Little India Historic District. To conceptualize the global-local nexus, the thesis adopts two bodies of theory. They are the 'locality concept' advanced by industrial geographers in the 1980s and writings on 'globalism-localism' by cultural/economic geographers in the 1990s. Both theoretical discussions reinforce the argument that place uniqueness is not necessarily sacrificed as a result of globalization. They also provide a way of viewing tourism geographies as the product of global and local forces.</description><creator>Chang, T. C. (Tou-Chuang)</creator><contributor>Lundgren, Jan O.

Wheat straw (WS) and T. reesei mutants were used in the study to evaluate the production of cellulase-systems. Hydrolysis of cellulose revealed the superiority of mild NaOH pretreatment over steam explosion for cellulase production with T. reesei MCG 80 and QMY-1. Response surface models were capable of predicting that NaOH could be used for the pretreatment of WS at 4% (w/w) without urea in the fermentation medium to yield optimum filter paper activity (FPA) of 9.9 IU/mL (247 IU/g WS) and beta-glucosidase activity ($ beta$GA) of 6.4 IU/mL (159 IU/g WS) under solid-state fermentation (SSF) conditions. Multiple regression analysis with multiple coefficients of correlation, R, between 0.957 and 0.99 from the experimental data showed close agreement between the cellulase activities (FPA and $ beta$GA) from the experiments and predicted values. The superiority of SSF over liquid-state fermentation (LSF) in the production of cellulase-systems was also established, and a prototype pan-bioreactor showed good potential for upgrading cellulase production under SSF conditions. The economics of fuel ethanol production was considered in the optimization model that sought to establish threshold cellulase loadings needed to achieve maximum cellulose hydrolysis for fermentation. High substrate concentrations of up to 7.5% were hydrolyzed with cellulase loadings of 24-30 IU/g and fermented by Pichia stipitis to achieve 90-100% conversion into ethanol. Crude unextracted cellulase yielded over 90% hydrolysis of delignified wheat straw and proved to be better than extracted cellulase and commercial cellulases for the hydrolysis of pure cellulose and pretreated wheat straw. Studies were also conducted to demonstrate the importance of the ratio of $ beta$GA- to FPA in cellulose hydrolysis which showed that ratios closer to one (1), produced more sugars and lowered the cellobiose content in the hydrolysates. It was also shown that the source of the cellulase is important in eliminating the accumulation of cellobiose during hydrolysis as was demonstrated with cellulase from mixed cultures of T. reesei and Aspergillus phoenicis. Higher $ beta$GA from the latter were implicated since A. phoenicis is a good $ beta$-glucosidase producer. Delignified wheat straw at 5% concentration when subjected to separate hydrolysis and fermentation and simultaneous hydrolysis and fermentation resulted in similar volumetric productivities (g/L/h) of ethanol.</description><creator>Awafo, Victor Ankang.</creator><contributor>Simpson, B.
