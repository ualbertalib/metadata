Evidence has been sought that showers can be initiated by snow trails. Cumulus clouds with tops above the freezing level often fail to precipitate. Theoretical studies show that snow trails could act as seeding agents for cumulus clouds, entrainment providing the mechanism whereby snow enters a cloud. Certain observed radar patterns suggest strongly that showers were produced in this manner. As a check, polar diagrams can be used to organize observations made on different bearings. Those constructed show showers occurring in regions of snow trails more frequently than elsewhere. This is further evidence that snow can act as a seeding agent in cumulus clouds.</description><creator>Dennis, Arnett. S.</creator><contributor>Marshall, J.

Even though the Cabinet in conjunction with the civil service formulates the legislative proposals and force them through Parliament, the power concentrated in the executive is not so great as many students might believe. For, the crystallization and the actual initiation of policy have shifted downward into the various social and economic groups within the community.</description><creator>Collins, F.

Aside from the action of direct load, deformations are produced in concrete by changes in temperature and in moisture content. Concrete, like steel and other structural materials, expands when heated, and contracts when cooled. In general, the coefficient of thermal expansion for concrete is considered to be not much different from that of carbon steel which is 6.5 x 10 -6 per degree F. Therefore, these two materials are assumed to contract or expand together in reinforced concrete structures. [...]</description><creator>Chow, David Y.F.</creator><contributor>Jamieson, R.E.

The importance of this lesion is recognized, for fatty infiltration has been shown to result in an impairment of hepatic function (54,188) and, if severe, to terminate in cirrhosis (39,41,46,47). Recent reports in the literature on the use of adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisone for the treatment of acute and chronic liver disease (26,29,82,44) are somewhat conflicting.
