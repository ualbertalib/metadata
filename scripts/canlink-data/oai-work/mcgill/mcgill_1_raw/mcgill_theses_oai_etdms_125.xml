Field and laboratory measurements of soil properties were conducted. Plow layer and deficit irrigation management approaches were evaluated. Irrigation requirements using rain and evaporation data of the humid 1996 summer, as well as data from the drier 1974 summer, were evaluated. The results show that using a root zone depth less than 300 mm led to more water losses by drainage, more irrigation water requirements and more frequent irrigation applications, as compared to using a 400 mm root zone. Therefore, it is recommended that a 400 mm root zone depth be used for scheduling irrigation applications of 25 mm. Wilting began to appear at 60% soil moisture depletion. Thus, 50% moisture depletion is suggested as the time to start irrigation to avoid crop stress. The principal assumptions for tabulation of irrigation scheduling were: (1) That the soil is at field capacity at the beginning of June; and (2) That upward flux from a water table is negligible, since the summer water table is deeper than 2 m. These assumptions are based on the facts that rain in May keeps the soil moist, the maize is small at the end of May and that AET (Actual Evapotranspiration) is less than PET (Potential Evapotranspiration). The measurements show that soil moisture depletion varies from site to site within the fields. The water balance was calculated using weather data and available soil moisture holding capacities for three locations on the farm. The tensions that the plant roots exerted to obtain water from the soil were measured with tensiometers and tabulated as a guide for irrigation management.</description><creator>Ibarra, Sandra.</creator><contributor>Broughton, Robert S.

The feedforward treatment consisted of training PD subjects to walk to preparatory signals, in the form of visual and auditory cues. Firstly, we compared the effects of 45 min of feedforward gait training, administered to 9 randomly selected PD subjects, to those of the exercise program, given to 7 PD subjects. Secondly, the effects of 3 weeks of feedforward gait training (n = 5) were compared to those of the exercises (n = 4). Gait and CRT measures were obtained at pre-test, at 45 min and 3 weeks post-treatment. Contrarily to the exercises, 45 min of feedforward gait training increased significantly the mean gait velocity, stride length and decreased the double limb support time (p $&lt;$ 0.01). Neither of the two treatments produced significant effects on the CRTs. Three weeks of feedforward gait training did not produce any additional changes on gait and CRTs. Three weeks of exercises exerted no effects on gait and CRTs. These findings indicated that the 45 min feedforward gait training effect cannot be carried over from gait to CRTs in PD, at least under our present gait training paradigm. The role of preparatory cues in the amelioration of certain PD gait parameters may be related to the improvement of the deficiencies in the parkinsonian motor preparatory process, at the level of the motor basal ganglia.</description><creator>Hurik, Ilona.</creator><contributor>Hui-Chan, Christina W.

This structure has been shown to undergo disfacilitation and active inhibition during SWS, changing its firing pattern and thus altering sensory afference to the cortex during this state. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) decreases are reported in the human thalamus in association with delta (1-4 Hz) and, even further, with spindle (12-15 Hz) wave activity during SWS. These results support the physiological changes purported to occur in the thalamus during this state. We also found rCBF decreases in association with delta in the brainstem reticular formation, cerebellum, anterior cingulate and orbito-frontal cortex. These changes, together with the thalamic decreases, might provide the physiological substrate for the progressive attenuation of sensory awareness and motor activity that occur during SWS. Regional CBF increases as a function of delta activity were found mainly in the visual and auditory cortices, possibly supporting dream-like imagery during SWS.</description><creator>Hofle Lindenberg, Nina.</creator><contributor>Jones, Barbara E.

CN can be treated using the cytokine G-CSF which decreases the period, increases the mean value, and elevates the amplitude of the oscillations. It has been theorized that this disease is a result of a periodic output of the hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow or a destabilization in a peripheral feedback mechanism controlled by circulating neutrophil number. We use a simple, but physiologically realistic, mathematical model, which incorporates the distribution of maturation times of neutrophils in the bone marrow, to study the latter possibility. We find that a change in the distribution of maturation times from normal to CN is insufficient to destabilize the system, and that even after a destabilization occurs, the model results are dissimilar from the observed CN dynamics. Also, G-CSF has a destabilizing effect on the system. Thus, it seems likely that the oscillations of CN are generated within the pluripotential stem cell population.</description><creator>Hearn, Taryn.</creator><contributor>Mackey, Michael C.

The purpose of this thesis is to integrate nested relations into Relix. While a flat relation is defined over a set of atomic attributes, a nested relation is defined over attributes which can include non-atomic ones, i.e. a data item itself can be a relation. To show the power of relational database systems, it is desirable to have nested relations in Relix. Our implementation was done using existing relational functionalities of Relix, without any modification of the physical data representation. Instead of focusing on nesting and unnesting as the major research direction of nested relations, we built nested relations on top of flat relations and we built nested queries by allowing the domain algebra to subsume the relational algebra. Users are able to take advantage of nested relations in Relix with only minimal new syntax being added to the system.</description><creator>He, Hongbo.</creator><contributor>Merrett, T. H.

The GA is stochastic by nature. It requires a well-tuned set of control parameters in order to perform well. The values of the control parameters depend on the nature of the problem. Finding the appropriate set of values for these parameters can be quite difficult. Using computer graphics, alongside theoretical analysis, to visualize the data generated by the GA aids in the study of the behavior of the genetic algorithm and helps in the fine-tuning of the parameters. In this thesis, the GA is described using John Holland's formal framework. An extension to this framework to encompass visual representations using geometric and organizational modeling is defined and an implementation, called PHGA, of both the genetic algorithm and its visual representation is discussed.</description><creator>Haroun, Paul.</creator><contributor>Devroye, Luc (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Genetic algorithm and data visualization</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/02870x87c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nc580p50c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9g54xk56c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:01:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Building on a small vocabulary, speaker independent, continuous speech recognition system, new methods for word hypotheses generation and word lattice pruning are suggested for very large vocabulary recognition. A weighted Levenshtein matching algorithm was created to transform a lattice of phonemes into word hypotheses based on acoustic evidence alone. This algorithm is applied in parallel with a lexical tree search algorithm to extract the most likely word candidates. Pruning of the lattice is achieved by eliminating redundant words occurring in the adjacent time frames of the lattice by removing all but the locally maximum scored words. Additionally, techniques are suggested for dealing with alternate pronunciations and common phoneme substitutions.</description><creator>Doyle, Sean.</creator><contributor>DeMori, Renato (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><subject>Language, Linguistics.</subject><title>Progressive word hypotheses reduction for very large vocabulary, continuous speech recognition</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kd17cw00r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9g54xk56c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mw22v748t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:01:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT) is a central osmoreceptor which regulates neurohypophysial hormone release through glutamatergic synapses onto hypothalamic magnocellular neurosecretory cells (MNC's). Previous studies have shown that OVLT neurons can express low threshold spikes which, in other neurons, contribute to rhythmic firing. Electrophysiological recordings were therefore obtained in the medial OVLT in superfused explants of rat hypothalamus, which was found to contain neurons projecting to MNC's in the supraoptic nucleus. The OVLT neurons recorded revealed the presence of tonic firing at varying frequencies (0-40 Hz), as well as two distinct forms of bursting activity. Among these, clustered firing featured the highest frequencies (up to 100 Hz), and was observed in 31% of the neurons studied. The effects of two conditioning protocols on synaptic function were investigated by examining excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP's) in MNC's during electrical stimulation of the OVLT. Trains of 100 Hz stimulation lasting 1 s were found to induce post-tetanic potentiation and long lasting potentiation ($&gt;$1 hr). Patterned stimulation mimicking clustered firing evoked only short-term ($&lt;$30 s) increases in EPSP amplitude capable of increasing the probability of spike discharge in MNC's. Activity patterns adopted by OVLT neurons may therefore be important for the regulation of neurohypophysial hormone release and body fluid homeostasis in vivo.</description><creator>Gentles, Stephen J.</creator><contributor>Bourque, C.

Two gene products were pulled out of two independent screens. We named them L5B and RVRin62. The RVRint62 was characterized in this research. RVRint62 is a partial cDNA clone of approximately 2.2 kb, which is expressed in most tissues. It interacts with both members of the RVR/Rev-erb$ alpha$ subfamily of the nuclear receptor superfamily. The domains of RVR responsible for the interaction with RVRint62 were characterized as the C-terminal of the LBD and the signature motif. The interaction domain of RVRint62 is situated in the first 300 amino acids of its N-terminus. The motif LXXLL, found in many co-regulatory proteins that interact with nuclear receptors, is also found in RVRint62. However, the LXXLL motif is not required for interaction with RVR. The potential modulating role of RVRint62 on RVR activity remains to be determined.</description><creator>Gallant, Josette.</creator><contributor>Giguere, Vincent (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Identification of a novel gene product interacting with the orphan nuclear receptors RVRREV-ERBℓ using the yeast two-hybrid system</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8049g6997.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sx61dp378</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4f16c462p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:01:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In the adult male rat, growth hormone (GH) is secreted in an ultradian fashion at regular 3.3-h intervals from the anterior pituitary. Physiological and morphological evidence indicates that this pattern of secretion may be the result not only of an interaction of the stimulatory hormone, growth hormone releasing factor (GRF) and inhibitory hormone, somatostatin (SRIF), at the level of the pituitary, but also at the level of the hypothalamus. Consistent with this, SRIF binding sites have been demonstrated on a subpopulation of GRF-containing neurons in the arcuate nucleus. The aim of this study, in general, was to examine what role, if any, these bindings sites play in the temporal regulation of GH secretion at the level of the hypothalamus. More specifically, the possibility of the existence of a temporal relationship between the established ultradian oscillation of GH secretion from the anterior pituitary and postulated fluctuation in the number and/or density of SRIF binding sites in the arcuate nucleus was examined.

After orchidectomy this tissue loses up to 80% of its weight. In the prostate, androgen withdrawal by orchidectomy is associated with apoptotic cell death. The objective of this study is to investigate whether apoptotic cell death is involved in the androgen dependent weight loss found in the orchidectomized rat epididymis. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were orchidectomized and apoptotic cells were identified by in situ TUNEL apoptosis detection. Throughout the rat epididymis, apoptotic cell death was localized specifically to epithelial cells. Androgen replacement therapy demonstrated that apoptosis in the caput, corpus and cauda epididymidis was prevented by androgen replacement. However, to prevent apoptosis completely in the initial segment requires androgen as well as luminal components from the testis. Efferent duct ligation induced a similar pattern of apoptosis in the initial segment of the epididymis, but there were fewer apoptotic cells in the caput epididymidis, and no apoptotic cell death in the corpus and cauda epididymidis. We conclude that withdrawal of androgen by orchidectomy induces a wave of apoptotic cell death in the epididymis, and apoptosis in the initial segment is caused by withdrawal of androgen as well as by luminal components.

An accurate intraoperative method of skull thickness measurement is not available to enhance the safety and efficacy of these procedures. The aim of this research represents the first attempt to examine the reliability of A-mode ultrasound for this purpose. Acoustic measures of bone thickness were analyzed followed by serial modifications of existing ultrasound probes. Standardized calvarial sites were identified and marked for experimentation with human cadaveric and live animal skull models. The individual points were insonified using an appropriately calibrated A-mode ultrasound transducer. As a gold standard, these values were then compared with digital caliper measurements and assessed for accuracy, validity and reliability. Statistical analyses revealed strikingly convergent values in skull thickness using A-mode ultrasound. These results clearly show that A-mode ultrasonic measurements are accurate, valid and reliable in predicting the thickness of the calvarium.

In this regard, several production systems have been recently developed. All of them share the general objective of using less energy per unit of output. The focus of this study for red pepper, is to examine the environmental performance of a plasticulture system compared to a conventional system in terms of: (1) energy inputs per unit of output; and (2) cost per unit of output. Energy analysis was performed to account for the total energy consumed in red pepper production under silver mulch and no-mulch. The method of process analysis was employed to account for total energy requirements for different inputs. Partial budgets for both type of production systems were constructed to estimate the costs of production. The analysis boundary was set at the farm gate.

Five buildup stages are recognized. The most consistently porous facies comprise grainy, proximal reef lithofacies. Early calcite spars occluded pores which influenced fluid flow during burial diagenesis. Dolomites have the highest porosities (up to 20%) due to leaching of calcite fossils. Permeability is greatest (up to 1000 mD) in porous dolomitized matrices. Fractures are typically plugged with pyrobitumen. Dolomite distribution is controlled by the more porous primary lithofacies and by proximity to faults. Most limestones are cemented tight although some contain up to 10% irreducible pores. Late-stage fluids that precipitated dolomites, calcites and sulphides ($ sp{87}$Sr/$ sp{86}$Sr $=$ 0.7370) probably were derived from the crystalline basement. These data can be explained by vertical flow of Laramide hydrothermal fluids along faults and lateral flow along the more porous and permeable facies.</description><creator>Duggan, James P.</creator><contributor>Mountjoy, Eric W.

In order to specifically evaluate the role of bursal mIg, we want to introduce by retrovirally mediated gene transfer a transgenic mIg construct which should be expressed on the B cell surface independent of endogenous Ig gene rearrangement. We therefore cloned the transmembrane (TM) form of the chicken $ mu$ heavy chain from a bursal cDNA library. Sequence analysis revealed 80% homology of the TM/cytoplasmic regions of chicken $ mu$ to the mouse homologue, in contrast to the much lower ($ sim$30%) overall homology when comparing $ mu$ extracellular domains. We have cloned a truncated form of the $ mu$TM (tr. $ mu$TM) lacking the VDJ-C$ mu$1 domains into the retroviral vector RCAS BP(B). In vitro transfection of chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) was used to assay for $ mu$ protein expression. Strikingly, the CEFs transfected with the $ mu$ transgene expressed the tr. $ mu$TM transgene on the cell surface, as determined by flow cytometry following viable cell staining with several anti-chicken $ mu$ mAbs. At this time, in vivo detection of the tr. $ mu$TM transgene has been unsuccessful, possibly due to rapid degradation of the transgenic protein. The successful expression of this molecule into the RCAS vector system will allow us to further determine whether expression of the tr. $ mu$TM will affect the progression of normal B cell development.</description><creator>Demaries, Sandra L.</creator><contributor>Ratcliffe, Michael (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>The role of signaling through mIgM in chicken B cell development /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x633f322z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gx41mk87c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9306t1205</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:01:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A variational semi-Lagrangian wind retrieval algorithm from single-Doppler radar data is studied both analytically and numerically, in order to understand its responses as well as limitations. The theoretical background on which the algorithm is based, is described in detail. A new approximation of the conservation equation of reflectivity for wind retrieval purposes is derived. It is shown that, in general, a unique wind field may not be available for the entire domain. However, some ways of minimizing this inconvenience are presented. The existence of a spurious solution when the conservation equation of a tracer is discretized is found analytically. A real case (a storm characterized by a mesocyclonic circulation) is used in order to illustrate the problem of the non-uniqueness of the solution. This is carried out through the study of the sensitivity of the algorithm to the moving frame and the initial guess. In addition, the influence of each one of the constraints used (conservation of reflectivity, continuity equation, smoothness constraint) in the retrieved wind field are analyzed. It is concluded that in spite of the sources of error described, the results may be meaningful.</description><creator>De Elía, Ramón.</creator><contributor>Zawadzki, Isztar (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</subject><title>A study of wind field retrieval from single Doppler radar data /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/37720f90f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9306t1205</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3j333433t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:01:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Cross-over designs are often used to compare treatments administered to subjects in different, pre-determined sequence with relatively few trials. The correlations within subjects arising from the repeated measurements may make the usual analysis of variance based on ordinary least squares (OLS) inappropriate to analyze such experiments. The aim of this thesis if to compare how the behavior of several tests used to analyze cross-over trails is affected by different structures and estimators of the covariance matrix. In particular, we replace the within-sequence sample dispersion matrix by Stein's estimator of the covariance matrix as a means of improving the robustness of two alternative tests, namely, a modified F-test approximation (MFA) and an empirical generalized least squares (EGLS) approach. Monte Carlo simulations were run to compare the performance of the two estimators of the covariance matrix using the OLS, MFA and EGLS methods. The results show that the modified F-test approximation gives adequate control of Type I error and that in certain cases, Stein's estimator of the covariance matrix offers an improvement over the within-sequence sample dispersion matrix in terms of robustness.</description><creator>D'Angelo, Giuseppina.</creator><contributor>Bellavance, Francois (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Statistics.</subject><title>A comparative study of approximate tests for cross-over designs using Stein's estimator of the covariance structure of the data /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dr26z038q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3j333433t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:v692t828z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:01:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This research examined how song is used to transmit information on individual identity in American redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla). Specifically, it attempted to determine whether American redstarts (1) discriminate between neighbors and strangers on the basis of their respective songs, and (2) recognize individuals by their distinctive voice characteristics. I tested the latter by exposing subjects to identical song types sung by different birds. Each subject's behavior was evaluated according to a variety of response variables. In all trials, for all response variables, subjects responded highly but equally to each of the songs played. A post-hoc analysis revealed that the order in which treatment songs were presented affected the birds' responses. For four of five response variables, subjects successfully distinguished between the songs of neighbors and strangers when played the fourth song in the trial. Thus, it would appear that in redstarts this type of discrimination may be observed only after an initial song-exposure period.</description><creator>Couroux, Christina.</creator><contributor>Lemon, Robert E.

For example, pesticides and herbicides are used on a world-wide scale to control a wide variety of harmful insects and competing weeds, to increase the production of food and fiber, and to facilitate modern agricultural production methods. Although these chemicals are designed to be selectively toxic towards target organisms, this is not absolute, and in most cases pesticides and herbicides are toxic toward non-target organisms, including humans. To identify genes which are transcriptionally regulated by cellular exposure to environmental pollutants, such as pesticides and herbicides, a 3000 Escherichia coli single-copy luxAB gene fusion library was previously screened in the presence of a pesticide or two herbicides (Costanzo, 1995). Five different clones whose luminescence is induced by either the herbicides, dinoseb and bromacil, or the pesticide, chlordane, were identified (Costanzo, 1995). Following partial characterization of the pesticide- and herbicide-responsive genes, luminescence experiments were repeated using new lots of bromacil, chlordane, and dinoseb. Experiments were performed to determine the basis for the observed fluctuations in luciferase expression.

It has various biological properties. In the last 10 years numerous reports showed that Vanadium administered orally could improve the metabolic state of diabetic animals. The combination of vanadate and H$ sb2$O$ sb2$ produced the new agents called peroxoVanadium (pV) compounds which exerted more potent insulin mimetic effects by activating the insulin receptor kinase. Their application in the treatment of diabetes could be of great benefit clinically in the future. We demonstrated that long-term oral bpV (phen) (a new pV compound) treatment resulted in a lowering of blood glucose levels, with less toxicity than vanadate in STZ-diabetic rats. bpV(phen) was the first agent other than insulin, that was able to maintain the insulin-deprived diabetic BB rats in good apparent health without ketonuria for 25 days by intraperitoneal injection (IP). Although bpV(phen) was ineffective in reducing glucose levels by IP injection in BB rats, it caused a significant decrease of insulin and C peptide levels and in the insulin dose required to maintain the aglycosuric state of the diabetic BB rats. These observations are consistent with a mechanism of bpV(phen) action at tissue levels. The exploration of the properties of pV compounds may help elucidate both the mechanisms of insulin action and the cause of diabetes, and also may give rise to insulin substitutes which could be orally administered for the treatment of diabetes in the future. However IP injection of bpV (phen) also caused severe toxic side effects. The toxic effects of bpV(phen) included inhibition of food and water intake, acceleration of the onset of diabetes and death. Further studies are required to identify second generation pV compounds with better therapeutic/toxicity ratios and to find ways of delivering pVs orally.</description><creator>Chu, Qingwei.</creator><contributor>Posner, Barry I.

The present work investigates the effect of forcing on the evolution of Rossby waves in a zero potential vorticity gradient environment. As a preliminary investigation, the barotropic case is studied, where the analogue of potential vorticity is absolute vorticity. The analytic solution of the linearized problem shows that the streamfunction grows algebraically in time, and eventually develops a nonlinear critical layer. The numerical solution of the nonlinear problem within the critical layer shows that the nonlinearity and the forcing act together to halt the growth as coherent vortices are put in a nonlinear oscillatory regime. At long times, the critical layer solution settles to a quasi-steady state consisting of relatively large amplitude stationary vortices, with a set of small amplitude steadily-propagating vortices superimposed. These results are contrasted with the results of previous unforced problems.</description><creator>Choboter, Paul F.</creator><contributor>Maslowe, Sherwin A.

Average walking velocity, cadence and stride length were determined while walking with and without FES at baseline and post-treatment evaluations. Changes in parameters were analyzed statistically and explained in biomechanical terms. FES-assisted gait training affected modifications in the gait parameters. One subject, initially a non-reciprocal walker, was able to walk overground at a faster velocity, cadence and longer stride length. Both subjects showed gains in these parameters over time. This study provided positive evidence for the use of FES-assisted gait training for these individuals with incomplete SCI.

The focus is on families with children between 9 and 24 months of age, particularly bilingual families, living in predominantly Inuit communities. Interviews with 11 families were examined to determine the major issues concerning language use, beliefs, and relationships. Two bilingual families were then examined in-depth over one year to gain a clearer understanding of their language behaviours and how they related to the cultures present in the homes and communities. Results of the study indicate that there is variation across bilingual families in many aspects related to language. Syncretism and dissociation of language and culture and their effects on the Inuit, educators, and speech-language pathologists are discussed.</description><creator>Chen, Clair.</creator><contributor>Crago, M.
