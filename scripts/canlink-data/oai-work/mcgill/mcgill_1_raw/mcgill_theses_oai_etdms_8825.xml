This thesisattempts to cover the adjustments in the means and modes of living of two irmnigrant groups in Montreal, Canada, the Italians and the Finns, and to present several general hypotheses concerning the assimilation process in these fields. The effects of the economic depression on these processes are noted. Spatial adjustment and chances in family organization are included in so far as these relate to our main points of reference. The principal source of information has been the family budgets of representative samples of the two groups. The Italians, of agricultural backgrounds, have settlednear the periphery of Uontreal. They have entered the building trades, dock labour, and factory trades. They exhibit a strong family unity. They are assimilating slowly towards the French. The Finnish men are migratory. Their employment is largely in the lumbering, mining,,farming and building industries. The women are domestic servants. The Finns have settled in a downtown area. They are assimilating quickly towards the English.</description><creator>Gibbard, Harold A.</creator><contributor>Hughes, E.

He usually tried to keep close to his own times, adapting classical and medieval material to the needs of contemporary society and, taken as a whole, his 'works present a complete panorama of nineteenth century life.

Now that the physiologist is more prone than formerly to fall back on the aids that have issued from the findings of physical science, a method taken directly from that field has been found to promise a means of accurately determining the changes in blood flow in a qualitative way and in some cases quantitative changes have been subjected to fairly accurate measuration. In this work the thermo-electric method as developed finally by Gibbs has been used in repeating some of the work that has recently been done with the use of older methods. The investigation has been confined to the parietal area of the brain and has covered the reactivity of the cerebral vascular bed in that area to as many agents as time has permitted.</description><creator>Norcross, Nathan Crosby</creator><contributor>Penfield, W.

In 1930 an intensive survey of all orchards in the Annapolis and adjacent Valleys was undertaken to determine how widespread the infestation was. The inspection work was carried on under the general supervision of the writer; and he was responsible for checking the identification of all the insects in regard to which there was any doubt. In order to carry this out successfully a careful study of the different larvae found in apples, and also the adults of the same, was made. The present paper is a report on these studies, the scope of which has been somewhat broadened from the original problem outlined above.</description><creator>Pickett, Allisin DeForest</creator><contributor>Brittain, W.

Dramatic theory and scenery and costumes, although closely allied to furniture, have been thoroughly treated by Mr. Allardyce Nicoll, Mr. E. K. Chambers, Mr. Gordon Craig, and others, while the subject of properties, only mentioned at times in the course of compositions on other subjects, has not been given much individual attention or the compliment of a full paper.

However, on closer study, it is apparent that a great deal of the work has been purely academic and of very little use to the practical mill operator. In the first place a large part of the llterature is devoted to the development of mathematical theories of crushing and their approval or condemnation; in the second place much of the practical work performed in laboratories has been done with inadequate equipment, that is if the results are to be applied to actual milling practice. Small laboratory mills with batch charges cannot be expected to give conditions approaching those in a full size mill with continuous feed and discharge. In the paper it is claimed that a 2 foot mill could be used to forecast the work of a commercial mill. This may be so, and, if truef establishes the 5 foot mill used at McGill University as a very desirable one for the same purpose. It supports the contention of the writer that anything smaller than a 2 foot mill is liable to give erroneous results.</description><creator>Denny, Denison</creator><contributor>McBride, W.

Such experimental work is much simplified if there exists some accurate method by which true efficiency can be measured. Conversely, if this efficiency cannot be measured then the work is much more difficult and some relative method of comparison must be resorted to. Only too often this results in disagreement as to a suitable usable unit and confusion in interpreting experimental data obtained.
