It has been said bfrequently that the endocrine pancreas, besides producing insulin, may produce another hormone which, in turn, might produce hyjerglycaemia, or a fat-metabolizing hormone or anti-ketogenie hormone. Most of those who have worked on this subject  have a tendency to consider that the alpha cell of the islet of Langerhans is, in the morphological field, the seat of this function. With the introduction of alloxan, which is a simple method of inducing selective necrosis of the beta cell of the islet, and with the development of histological technique in the last few years for the differential study of the islet cell, it would appear that a thorough study of this problem should be considered.

The ancients dried fish and meat in the sun as a means of preservation, and sun dried fruits have beenfamiliär foods for centuries. More recently the commercial dehydration of a wide ränge of food products has become one of the worldTs major food preservation Industries. Commercialfood dehydration appears still to be in its infancy In spite of these recent developments.Several advantages of drying foods to a low moisture content are obvious, such as facilitation of transportation,convenience in use, Prolongation of the storage period and decrease of storage space requirement. On the other hand, a few disadvantages remain, Chief of which is the decrease ofpalatability and nutritional quality of many dehydrated products during storage. Research during recent years has vastly improved the keeping qualities of dried foods, butthe fundamental causes of many types of spoilage are by no means completely understood.

In 1936 Quastel, Tennenbaumand Wheatley(87) demonstrated the presence in brain cortex slices of an enzyme system which synthesizes ACh, and showed that the synthesis is closely associated with the aerobiobreakdown of glucose. It was found also that glucose can be replaced to some extent by lactate or pyruvate, but still only under aerobic condition. [...]</description><creator>Harpur, R.

The extent of the exchange is measured by making the common atom in one of the compounds detectable as a radioactive or stable isotope, the former being preferred because it is more readily traced. At the end of the reaction time the two compounds are separated and the distribution of the isotope measured. If complete exchange has taken place each compound has the same proportion of isotope, but if no exchange has occurred all the isotope is found in the original compound. The exchange reaction has been recognized as a valuable tool in chemistry, particularly in organic chemistry, because it gives direct information regarding bond reactivities and reaction mechanisms. The reaction offers an excellent method of studying some of the most fundamental properties of chemical compounds because it provides a remarkably simple system. Since the reactants and products are chemically identical there is no heat of reaction, only an energy of activation; concentrations remain constant and there are no interfering products or by-products. It is, therefore, somewhat surprising to note that the mechanism of the exchange reaction in solution has not been completely studied.

Although it is unlikely that the worm is harmful to man (Martin, 1920; Kahl, 1938), the aesthetic distraction confronting a human consumer is readily apparent. The widespread occurrence of this worm in an important commercial fish presents a grave problem not only to the fresh-fish industry but also to the canned-fish industry in the Atlantic Maritime provinces of Canada. Fish producers are frequently compelled to employ personnel whose sole function is the removal of worms from fillets and this procedure is obviously expensive. It has been conservatively estimated that this infection is the cause of an annual loss to the fishing industry of approximately two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. The situation was so serious that in 1945 it was decided to study the life history of the parasite in an effort to disclose some method of control[...]Although the primary purpose of this investigation at the time of its conception was the discovery of some method of control of the parasite, the body of the investigation as presented in this paper soon developed into a study of the life history of the worm[...]It will be later seen that the course of the investigation has led the author not only to a consideration of the developmental history of the worm but also to a consideration of its ecological behaviour.[...]</description><creator>Scott, David Maxwell.</creator><contributor>Stanley, J.

Research on such materials was initiated in the hope of finding valuable constituents in sufficient quantity to warrant the recovery of the extractives on a commercial scale, because at present bark is a major waste product of the Pulp and Paper Industry. Since previous workers in this field were limited in the extent of their investigations by the inadequate quantity of bark which they studied, the present research was commenced on a pilot plant scale. In order that comparative studies could be made with past or future work, the bark was peeled from the trees in the woods rather than collected from river-run pulp logs. The methanol extract from about 600 pounds of bark was precipitated with water and this precipitate was extracted with ligroin and diethyl ether. [...] Consequently, the research resolved itself into three major tasks, the identification of the neutral esters, the separation and study of the neutral unsaponifiable matter and the investigation of the nature of the fatty acids present. Throughout the project, attempts were made to obtain strictly quantitative yields of the various components. In this connection the decision to conduct the work on a large scale has been repeatedly vindicated because certain constituents are present only in minute quantity.</description><creator>Harwood, Victor Douglas.</creator><contributor>Purves, C.

Because of the scarcity of organisms in some specimens, concentration methods were devised to give a more delicate demonstration of the bacilli than was possible by direct smear or culture. The increasing importance of bacteriological methods for diagnosis in many cases of suspected tuberculosis has given a stimulus to the study of such procedures. In spite of the voluminous literature that has been published there is still a need for a more satisfactory method for the demonstration of the presence of the tubercle bacilli in pathological specimens. The development of nutritive media has made great progress since the time of Koch, but there still remains much to be desired from the point of view of time required for the appearance of colonies and the initiation of growth from minimal inocula. A concentration method based on the flotation principle of Lange and Nitsche (1909) utilizing oil as the agent, and the medium described by Dubos (1945), using Tween and albumin were investigated for this problem, with the view of achieving a more satisfactory method for the demonstration of the tubercle bacillus.</description><creator>Hawirko, Roma Z.</creator><contributor>Murray, E.
