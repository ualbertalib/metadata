It was suggested that I perform haemograms on some cholesterol-fed and some normal animals to determine if the anaemia actually occurred. The results of this pilot experiment, recorded in the appendix, showed a significant degree of anaemia in six cholesterol- and fat-fed rabbits as compared with normal blood values in ten rabbits on a diet of unadulterated commercial chow. The animals on the atherogenic diet also showed leucocytesis and a quite marked reticulocytosis. The findings prompted a review of the literature on blood changes associated with atherogenic diets, and related regimes.</description><creator>Silver, Meredith. M.</creator><contributor>McMillan, G.

The incorporation into glutamate and aspartate is lower than that observed in normal rat brain cortex slices or chick embryo. This may be due to a lower rate of operation of the citric acid cycle compared with that of glycolysis in tumours. When normal rat brain cortex slices are incubated with tumour tissues in vitro, in a medium containing 5 mM 14 glucose-U-C14, there is a decrease in the amount of glutamine found in the brain cortex slices, with a concomitant increase in the incorporation of glucose carbon into glutamate, aspartate and alanine of the tumour tissues.</description><creator>Shrivastava, Gyan.

Japan imported 4.7 times as much from Canada as she exported to that country. The average value of Canadian imports from Japan in the 1935 to 1939 period was $4,649,000 (Canadian dollars) annually, which accounted for only 0.67 per cent of the average annual value of Canadian imports from the world at this period, (see Table 1.1). After the War, formal Japanese-Canadian trade relations were resumed and by 1951 Japan had a substantial trade deficit with Canada. In 1953, Japanese imports from Canada were more than eight times as large as her exports to Canada; while Japanese exports to Canada in the same year were $13,629,000 (Canadian dollars), which amounted to less than 0.3 per cent of the total Canadian imports from the world.</description><creator>Shibata, Hirofumi.</creator><contributor>Asimakopulos, A.

The morphology and chemistry of nucleoli, as well as the origin of nucleolar material, have been ably reviewed by Vincent (1955) and by Stich (1956). Although the literature is very extensive, little quantitative data is available regarding the absolute numbers and sizes of nucleoli. Historically, Lebert (1851; cited by Hoffman, 1953) was the first to attempt an assessment of nuclear and nucleolar diameters in animal cells. His measurements of cancer cell nuclei and nucleoli are, however, of little consequence as quantitative information.</description><creator>Shea, John. R.</creator><contributor>Leblond, C.

Although it is but a small collection, its range of subject-matter, of style, and of quality is enormous.

Comprehensive work on the balance of thermal energy in temperate regions has been performed and reported, particularly by Thornthwaite and Halstead, (TH54). However, results of similar completeness are lacking for oceanic regions, a fact illustrated by the omission of detail for these areas in Budyko's world atlas of heat balance, (Bu55). The determination of the energy budget is particularly interesting in the Arctic, where an immense latent heat is involved in the freezing and subsequent melting of the oceans.</description><creator>Schwerdtfeger, Peter.</creator><contributor>Gold, L.

The approach is semi field theoretical, but one reduces the essentially relativistic scheme to the situation where one can place a potential function V in the two nucleon SchrÃ¶dinger equation. In an adiabatic approximation one calculates the change in energy in the system due to the meson exchange activity between the two nucleons a fixed distance apart. When one allows the quasi-static nucleons to move by including Laplacian operators for them in the total Hamiltonian, a spin orbit potential emerges. The calculation is performed up to an exchange of two mesons. Multiple scattering corrections to the potential are accounted for by using the one meson approximation of Chew and Low. An empirical hard core is affixed. In that, also, Chew's values of the cut-off factor and the renormalized coupling constant are used, the calculation fit a within the framework of the Chew-Low theory. The results finally are compared to the empirical ones of Gammel and Thaler, but the agreement is not good.</description><creator>Schiff, Mortimer.</creator><contributor>Sharp, R.

The strength of the rectangular reinforced concrete beams, all of which fail due to direct shear and torsion, agree favourably with the tensile strength of concrete determined from indirect tension tests. Initial cracks occurred in all the beams at a load corresponding to a combined shear stress of 346 psi in an unreinforced section under combined bending, shear and torsion. Results indicate that the shear reinforcement ceases to be fully effective as the Pt/p+p' ratio approaches and exceeds unity. Moreover the concept of a transition from elastic to plastic states of stress is proved by the results.

This situation has existed for over 500 years, and during the latter part of this period, particularly since 1924, the cane breeding section of the Department of Agriculture has carried on extensive work in developing high yielding varieties of sugar cane especially suited to the island. The nature of investigation has, however, being virtually confined to this one direction, and study of the other important growth factors such as edaphic and especially climatic control has lagged far behind. Fortunately in 1959 a microclimatic station was set up at Waterford under the auspices of the Geography Department of McGill University, and in the last 2 years a considerable knowledge of various climatic parameters has been amassed, and an insight into the moisture balance regime achieved.</description><creator>Rouse, Wayne.

Firstly, the core is allowed a uniform radial expansion and contraction due to the presence of the ^ particle. Secondly, the core can assume an ellipsoidal shape from its original spherically symmetrical form, the volume remaining constant, to first order. The results indicate that both distortions are significant. The maximum reduction of the r. m. s. radius of the core is 24.2%, with a consequent reduction of 12.6% for the mean value of the well depth for the^ - nucleon potential, necessary to bind the hypernucleus.</description><creator>Roth, Charles.</creator><contributor>Sharp, R.

The abilities and promise of these machines cover such a wide scope, that probably no other technological development in this decade, if in any decade, holds as much promise for human betterment. Many problems that once had to be left unsolved because of the limited abilities of classical mathematics, can now be answered. More important than the absolute limit of man's capabilities are the numerous problem solutions that these machines have brought within economic feasibility.</description><creator>Roggeveen, Roland.

However, it would be uncorrect to state that no significant advances have been made in recent years. As a matter of fact, the new methods available have enabled biochemists, pathologists and clinical investigators not only to re-search, (quoting Dr. Skoryna), some of the older findings, but also to throw some light on the intricate processes in fat absorption which were unapproachable by older methods.</description><creator>Rodriguez, Jacinto.</creator><contributor>Skoryna, S.

The study of spallation reactions, in particular the study of 'excitation functionsâ - variation of production cross section with incident energy - is a simple and often very useful means of investigating the mechanism of nuclear reactions. As discussed later, excitation functions for spallation reactions may be divided roughly into two classes, those for which the threshold is in the region where the Bohr compound nucleus mechanism is said to be applicable ( &lt; 50 Mev), and those with the threshold in the Serber knock-on region ( &gt; 50 Mev).</description><creator>Rayuda, Garimella.

At room temperature the kinetic energy of the molecule is sufficient to supply the activation energy for ring interconversion, therefore no pure conformation can be isolated although the more stable chair form is the predominant one. Hassel and Ottar (2) pointed out the different nature of the cyclohexane substituents which are now called equatorial and axial. They also realized the greater thermodynamic stability of equatorially substituted cyclohexanes as compared to axially substituted ones.</description><creator>Puskas, Imre.</creator><contributor>Edward, J.

It is possible to study growth at several levels. It may be measured at the level of the organism proper; at the level of the tissues or organs; at the level of the cells and now, by chemical methods, even at the level of molecules. However, a growth is analyzed into its constituent parts, the problems of expressing the process have become manifold. Indeed, as Weiss (1949) staged, âIt (growth) is not even a scientific term with defined and constant meaning, but a popular label that varies with accidental traditions, predilections, and purposes of the individual or school using it.â</description><creator>Puddy, Della.

The marked physiological activity of this substance could have been suspected from the early pharmacologic studies of Hunt and Taveau who demonstrated its intense depressor activity. Later, Ewins isolated it from specimens of ergot which had depressor action on organs supplied by autonomic nerves. Dale then found that this depressor activity was similar to that of muscarine-like substances and that this effect could be abolished by atropine. The same author also showed that ACh could easily be inactivated by an esterase present in tissue.</description><creator>Proulx, Peter.</creator><contributor>Hosein, E.

Addition of ADP or DPN to the assay medium could increase the enzyme 1s activity; nicotinamide or alloxan depressed it. It is suggested that failure of glycolytic activity during preservation is not therefore due to the formerly supposed lability of hexokinase, but to inhibition of hexokinase attributable to falling pH and ATP, and conditions favouring glucose-6-P accumulation such as decrease of phosphofructokinase, DPN and ADP. Pyruvate produced in cells during the first 15 days of storage tended to be expelled into the external medium. Cyclic adenylate was utilised by the human red cell, as evidenced by conversion of its ribose moiety into lactic acid with concomitant esterification of inorganic phosphate into the stable phosphate fraction.</description><creator>Prevost, Charles.</creator><contributor>Denstedt, O.
