The world over farmers appeared to be relatively less affluent than industrial workers. The world over, therefore, there seemed to be a relative growth of industry accompanied by a resultant decline in agriculture.</description><creator>Davoud, Raymond. I.</creator><contributor>Kemp, M.

It originated in the central Andean region of South America, but there is controversy concerning the original home of the plant as to whether it was in Chile or in Peru and Bolivia. There is also some doubt as to whether the potato was introduced into North America from Europe, or brought directly from South America by Spanish explorers.</description><creator>Cutcliffe, Jack.

Recent nutritional surveys have suggested that geographic variations in the incidence of multiple sclerosis are due at least in part to the amount of fat consumed. Dr. Swank (Swank, 1950; Swank, Lerstad, Strom and Backer, 1952) made a survey of Holland, Denmark, Norway and Switzerland and compared figures of the dietary habits and the incidence of multiple sclerosis before, during, and after World War II when there were wide fluctuations in the dietary habits.</description><creator>Cullen, Chester.

The following is based on his treatment which has been extended to include a fourth r. f. pulse per cycle of operations. Consider a sample containing protons placed in an external magnetic field Ho applied along the z-axis. When the field is applied, the net magnetization vector M will be aligned with this field. At t = 0, a pulse of r.f. energy of frequency ùo (the Larmor frequency) is applied. The vector H will then process about H1 the r. f. magnetic field vector, in addition to its precession about Ho. If the xy plane rotates with a frequency ùo, H1 can be considered to lie along the u- (rotating x-) axis.</description><creator>Crawford, Gerald. J.</creator><contributor>Foster, J.

The objective is two-fold: a better understanding of history; and an empirical testing of theories. In some senses, the present work is a record of frustrations. Appendix I, and the bulk of chapter 5, record unsuccessful attempts to fit certain precise theories of economic development to the facts of Canadian history. The theories demand types of information which cannot be had, or which it is not within my powers, or the scope of my intention, to discover.</description><creator>Corbett, David.

The cultivated berry, as it is known today, is a relatively recent product of plant breeding. The cultivated strawberry is derived from two species. They are Fragaria virginiana, the wild meadow strawberry of eastern North America, and Fragaria chiloensis, the beach strawberry, which is found along the Pacific coast. The first improvement occurred among the Indians of Chile before Columbus landed at San Salvador. By selection from Fragaria chiloensis, they obtained plants which bore fruit of exceptional size and quality.</description><creator>Collins, William. B.</creator><contributor>Taper, C.

The nature of the exchangeable cation is an example of an important chemical factor contributing to the properties of many clays. Experimental work has shown that in some soils swelling due to frost action can be dramatically reduced by changing the exchangeable cation./47 Other work indicates that the bearing capacity of piles may be increased by promoting cation exchange./47 At the Golden Gate Exposition the permeability of a lagoon was reduced 90% as the result of cation exchange./37</description><creator>Coates, Donald.

Erasistratus, a Greek anatomist of Alexandria, discovered and named the gland in the human (Mettler, 1947). However, in spite of this early start, the physiology and the biochemistry of the prostate and other male accessory sex glands were for long neglected. But in the last few years, these structures have been the subject of comprehensive investigations (Huggins, 1945; 1946-47; Mann and Lutwak-Mann, 1951) stimulated by the growing interest in the problem of fertility in domestic animals and man.</description><creator>Clayton, Blanche-Petite.</creator><contributor>Scott, C.
