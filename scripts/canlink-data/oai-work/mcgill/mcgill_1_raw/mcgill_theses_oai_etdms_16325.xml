To date, this well-excavated text has not been quarried with a feminist eschatological lens. Despite the sexist legacy attributed to Augustine, this study asks: Do women have a stake in the City of God? If so, to what extent? The recurring theme that runs through Augustine's text speaks to two orders of human society: civitas dei and civitas terrena, the city of God and the earthly city. These orders, identified by their God-directed or self-directed loves, create a powerful tension between the iniquities of life and human potential. Eschatological love and the politics of heaven take shape within this tension. The aim of this investigation has been to break ground in a new direction by examining the ways in which feminist eschatology can utilize or benefit from Augustine's eschatological enterprise. Divided into five sections, this research opens with a working description of feminist eschatological thought and examines the foundations prescribed by Rosemary Radford Ruether, Sallie McFague and Elizabeth Johnson in order to provide a backdrop for reading Augustine's text. Chapter 2 surveys the core positions of three eminent Augustinian scholars---John Neville Figgis, Robert A. Markus and Robert Dodaro---whose perspectives underscore Augustine's estimation of life, his evaluation of the social perimeters of human existence, and his perception of justice. Building upon these foundations, it is intrinsic to my argument to examine the ways in which Augustine subverts social norms, takes measure of woman, and establishes hope. This discourse takes shape in Chapter 3. In Chapter 4, I evaluate classical eschatological issues from Augustine's repertoire---predestination, hell, heaven, and the resurrection of the body---and question the applicability of Augustine's hell-bound or heaven-directed futurity to feminist eschatology. The final chapter places Augustine and McFague in dialogue. She offers one of the most compatible reserves for acquiring more insight into Augustine's eschatological consciousness and subversive wisdom through a shared appreciation of metaphoric language, incarnational Christology, creation theology, and a vision of transformation and hope by re-centering all being in God.</description><creator>Nemazee, Rowshan.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Augustine, Saint, Bishop of Hippo.

This study examines al-Samman's metaphysical teachings as well as his views on ritual and devotion. In particular, we analyze the metaphysical teachings of al-Samman's Southeast Asian students on the concepts of God, the Cosmos and wah&amp;dotbelow;dat al-wujud (unity of existence). The development of the Sammaniyah t&amp;dotbelow;ar iqah and al-Samman's influence on popular religion are also examined. This study shows us that al-Samm an and his Southeast Asian students were influenced by the teachings of previous s&amp;dotbelow;ufis. With regard to the concept of the logos of Muh&amp;dotbelow;ammad, the most important of al-Samman's contributions is his teaching on the cult devoted to the posthumous existence of the Prophet Muh&amp;dotbelow;ammad.</description><creator>Muthalib, Abdul, 1961-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Sammān, Muḥammad ibn ʻAbd al-Karīm, 1718-1775.</subject><subject>Sufis -- Saudi Arabia.</subject><subject>Sufism -- Saudi Arabia.</subject><subject>Khalwatīyah members -- Biography.</subject><title>The mystical teachings of Muḥammad 'Abd al-Karīm al-Sammān, an 18th century Şūfī /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6682x747q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s1784q096</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Islamic Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6m311t02k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This is a case study of participant narratives in the prior learning assessment and recognition (PLAR) process at The Royal Military College (RMC) in Kingston, Ontario. RMC is under the direction of the Department of National Defence Canada, and has a full-time staff dedicated to the maintenance and expansion of the prior learning assessment and recognition process. The research problem of this thesis is to ask if a participant in a prior learning assessment and recognition program acknowledges their own knowledge as valuable and how this may be linked to the motivating factors that cause the participant to return to formal study. In order to provide a context for the research problem, I use the literature review to examine the history of prior learning assessment and recognition programs in Canada. Through a mail survey, the use of participant narratives provides a voice to the literature in discussing the question of how knowledge is valued in a prior learning assessment program. Although the focus of the thesis will be prior learning assessment and recognition in Canada, the background to the concept of prior learning assessment is found in the United States. It is therefore essential to begin there in order to provide a context in which to understand the current Canadian situation. As a timeline the study begins with the post-World War II era and continues to the present. The sub-theme of my doctoral research is to investigate how the concept of prior learning assessment and recognition in Canada has been influenced by the broader context of globalization.</description><creator>Moss, Leah.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Adult education -- Ontario -- Kingston -- Case studies.</subject><subject>Educational tests and measurements -- Case studies.</subject><subject>Royal Military College of Canada.</subject><title>Prior learning assessment and recognition (PLAR) and the impact of globalization : a Canadian case study</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2f75rc551.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6m311t02k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5425kf29x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The aim of this thesis is to analyse the inscription of the Beat Generation in Quebec literature. It is not a study of the movement's reception in Quebec when it emerged in the fifties, but rather one of its further reappropriation by Quebec writers. To read this Quebec contemporary corpus necessitates a thorough knowledge of the Beat Generation's writings and of the studies on the movement and its writers. Therefore, I will begin by outlining the personal history and literary approach of the main Beat Generation writers, who never wrote a manifest. Then, I will proceed with the analysis of the Quebec corpus by using the main themes of the movement, the textual inscriptions, citations, as well as explicit or hidden references in characters' names or places. I will also establish affiliations between characters from both corpus. This, of course, by staying as close as possible to the texts, in order to analyse the Beat Generation in Quebec literature. In the first chapter, I will study what links writers such as Claude Peloquin, Lucien Francoeur, Jean-Paul Daoust and Raoul Duguay to the Beat Generation. Then, I will study the relation of three Quebec writers with Jack Kerouac: Victor-Levy Beaulieu, Gilles Archambault and Jean-Noel Pontbriand are inspired by him and use his work and his biography to talk about themselves. Finally, I will study writings of authors such as Rejean Ducharme, Jacques Poulin, Dany Laferriere, Louis Hamelin and Michel Vezina, who are interested in certain elements of the Beat Generation and who have integrated them in their writings. My research relies on the hypothesis that a group of writers from the United States of America had a considerable influence on Quebec literature, giving it a certain American Characteristic. Therefore, by reading Quebec corpus in relation with the Beat Generation movement, I am studying "l'americanite quebecoise". The purpose of this thesis is to show that America is not only a continent where one can travel, it is actually a group of texts to read, that are written in relation to each other and that have roots in a common north American imaginary, territory, history and intellectual nomadism.</description><creator>Ménard, Jean-Sébastien.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>French-Canadian literature -- 20th century -- History and criticism -- Québec (Province)</subject><subject>Beat generation.</subject><subject>French-Canadian literature -- 20th century -- History and criticism.</subject><title>Une certaine Amérique à lire : la beat generation et la littérature québécoise</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1z40kx42d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5425kf29x</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:dj52w8241</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation provides a detailed study of an unusual approach to the opposition between contemplative and active lives. The approach that I focus on argues, first, for withdrawal from conventional forms of political action on the grounds that the political life is ineffective in accomplishing good in conditions of injustice. This position is supported by presenting a moral critique of existing politics, positing an underlying moral failure among the citizens and their leaders as the cause of our political shortcomings. Any effective attempt to address these shortcomings must therefore be able to contribute to a moral re-orientation. Ordinary political methods fail to do this, however, because they must adopt and appeal to the prevailing moral outlook in achieving and exercising power. Secondly, then, the approach suggests that under existing circumstances of injustice, the contemplative life, a life devoted to attaining personal spiritual perfection through pursuing knowledge of one's real good, is better suited to achieving the good ideally sought through politics. In motivating the contemplative life as a model of political action, the approach draws on an ideal extra-political entity, a normative cosmology, to serve as an alternative context for action, in contrast to the world of political competition. I trace this line of thought through the writings of three rather different thinkers, Plato, Seneca and Gandhi. In the case of each author, I study a particular dialogue in the context of their thought more broadly: Plato's Gorgias, Seneca's De Otio, and Gandhi's Hind Swaraj. The thesis takes up some of the key problems that arise from their similar approaches to the contemplative life as a model of the political life in order to evaluate its relevance from a contemporary perspective. These include the claim that political discourse should be directed towards a correct understanding of our own real good, the view that there exists a real good for each of us that we do not often perceive, the notion that a normative cosmology can play a role in motivating our political engagements, and the question of whether the contemplative life can be relevant to a participatory politics.</description><creator>Mehdi, Syed Mohamed.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Gandhi, Mahatma, 1869-1948.</subject><subject>Contemplation.</subject><subject>Political science -- Philosophy.</subject><subject>Plato.</subject><subject>Seneca, Lucius Annaeus, ca. 4 B.C.-65 A.D.</subject><title>The political dimension of the contemplative life : engagement and disengagement in Plato, Seneca and Gandhi</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w3763b48d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dj52w8241</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Philosophy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9019s606h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation questions conventions of Victorian narrative and gender by examining the character of the fallen man as an identifiable literary persona. Fallen men are characterized by their sexuality and conscienceless actions. Their fallenness is contingent on their perceived social standing and genteel expectations. Two popular assumptions about Victorian novels---the gendered specificity of the fallen woman and the propriety of narrative closure---are threatened by the presence of fallen men. While a fallen woman and her miserable fate warn women of the irrevocability of sexual mishaps, fallen men caution readers that the everyday vices to which they may succumb opium, gambling, scientific experimentation, and, later in the century, dandyism---could lead to dire consequences, such as social alienation and unnatural death. Each of these vices represents a threat to Victorian social norms: opium addicts cannot distinguish between innocence and guilt; gamblers highlight the instability of capital and the desperate state of some aristocrats; mad scientists destabilize conceptions of truth; dandies question both rigid notions of masculinity and heterosexuality. Both appealing and evil, fallen men challenge paradigms of hero and villain. Sexually virile, these men also inadvertently save compromised women by suffering untimely deaths. Assumptions about both masculinity and formulaic novelistic structure are undermined when fallen men cannot be redeemed. Using narratology as my methodological framework, I address fallen men in novels published between 1860 and 1900. These fictional figures are prone to the same weaknesses and are tempted by the same vices that befell real Victorian men. Fallen men in Uncle Silas, Man and Wife, Daniel Deronda, Heart and Science, The Woodlanders, and The Picture of Dorian Gray represent distinct and overlapping forms of male deviance. The fallen man demonstrates the insufficiency of pre-scripted gender roles when he embodies and surpasses the traits of gentlemen, dandies, rakes, Byronic heroes, cads, and villains. By inserting fallen men in their novels, Victorian writers question pre-existing gender divides; by killing off their dashing disturbers, these novelists also facilitate the erosion of structural norms.</description><creator>King, Stephanie, 1976-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Men in literature.</subject><subject>Sex in literature.</subject><subject>English literature -- 19th century -- History and criticism.</subject><subject>Vice in literature.</subject><title>Devious, dashing, disturbing : fallen men in Victorian novels, 1860-1900</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/73666831k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9019s606h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7s75dh14r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This qualitative study examines second language (L2) teaching and learning with an emphasis on the meaning-making processes of 17 young L2 learners learning the Korean language within a multilingual context at a Korean Saturday School in Montreal, Canada. Based on Vygotsky's (1978) dialectical analysis, this study explores the microgenetic analysis of young L2 learner's concept formation in non-school and school contexts within the larger macrogenetic analysis of the historical, socio-cultural, political, economical and educational contexts that affect L2 teaching and learning. The major goal of this study is to investigate the role of literacy-based and concept-oriented playful activities in the teaching and learning of language within a L2 classroom. As a teacher/researcher, based on the theme of shapes, I focus on integrating potentially mathematical experiences around literacy activities within my students' social and cultural contexts. In particular, I examine creative language use through dynamic collaborative engagement while considering how young L2 learners internalize, appropriate and externalize multimodal mediators and language(s). In order to clarify the meaning of an interpretation, this study has involved multiple interconnected interpretive sources over the duration of the 2005-2007 school years. Macrogenetic analysis reveals that teachers still implement traditional Confucian ways of teaching, such as content-centered curriculum, teacher-centered instruction, and passive learning. However, microgenetic analysis of students' meaning-making processes provides new insights into L2 learning-and-teaching, with an emphasis on the creative co-construction of meaning by L2 learners, their parents and their teachers. That is, as active social actors in a shared literacy practice, young L2 learners, their parents and their teachers should be motivated by aesthetic, creative experience and should be actively engaged within a collaborative social context. The results of this study suggest a substantial role for creative teaching, and leads to my development of a model of 'creative apprenticeship', which describes an ongoing, multidimensional, dialectical process of L2 teaching-and-learning.</description><creator>Kim, Mi Song, 1971-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Children -- Language.</subject><subject>Korean language -- Study and teaching -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><title>Young second language (L2) learner's meaning-making : consciousness, collaboration, and creativity (3Cs)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rr172177h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7s75dh14r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1v53k171s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:01:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Teachers' perspectives on teaching and learning in higher education have been identified as a critical area of research. This qualitative study was designed to answer the following question: How does reflecting on teaching and learning within a two year period in a professional development program (the Master Teacher Program, or MTP) contribute (or not) to teachers' changing perspectives on teaching and learning? I interviewed six Quebec CEGEP (college) teachers on five different occasions, as they completed the first four courses in the MTP. The participants were female, taught in different disciplines, programs, and colleges, and had various years of teaching experience. Repeated, semi-structured interviews were analyzed, using the dual processes of categorizing and connecting (Maxwell &amp; Miller, in press). Results converged to reveal four patterns and three major dimensions. Through categorizing, four patterns emerged that described a process of movement from teacher to learner-centeredness. I used the four metaphors of awakening, stretching, exercising, and shaping to represent these four patterns. Furthermore, I corroborated these findings by examining participants' concept maps and their reflective journals. I found additional evidence for the four patterns in the narrative summaries that I constructed, using connecting strategies. These narratives also exposed some of the more contextualized aspects of the evolution in teacher perspectives. In addition to the four patterns, three major dimensions related to teacher perspectives emerged. The participants reported that they had become more aware of the learner and the learning process, more intentional in curriculum planning and teaching, and they increased in self-knowledge, and in particular, in their sense of identity as teacher professionals. Reflection on practice functioned as a major factor underlying changes in perspectives. Time was also a significant factor. Findings showed that it took at least one year for most of the participants to link theory with practice, before they reported implementing changes in pedagogy. Therefore, changes in perspectives preceded changes in practice. The results of this study suggest that professional development programs, such as the MTP, can help teachers evolve as effective practitioners. Moreover, such programs can also help to foster a sense of professional identity among teachers in higher education. Future research can further clarify relationships among perspectives, teaching experience, and disciplinary background, and continue to explore incentives for teachers in higher education to participate in professional development.</description><creator>Kerwin-Boudreau, Susan.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Teachers -- Attitudes.</subject><subject>Teachers -- Training of.</subject><title>The evolving practitioner : a qualitative inquiry into reflections on teacher perspectives in a professional program in higher education</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2b88qg758.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1v53k171s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2801pk869</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:01:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Boys with behaviour problems (BP) exhibit a variety of difficulties in academic and socio-behavioural-emotional domains. Interventions offered at the early elementary years can significantly decrease difficulties that can occur later in life. Without early interventions, behaviour difficulties can persist into adolescence and adulthood. In addition to the difficulties experienced in the academic and socio-behavioural-emotional domains, boys with BP tend to endorse negative self-perceptions and based on the scarce literature, they also tend to have a low social status, as perceived by their peers. As the profile for boys with BP is well established and tends to be stable, effective interventions that encompass academic and behavioural components must be implemented in the school environment, in which boys spend a great portion of their day. The present study focussed on investigating the effects of a well-researched programme, Classwide Peer Tutoring (CWPT), on the academic, behavioural, on-task, self-concept and social status of 40 boys with BP following 12 weeks of participation in the programme. A control group of 33 boys with and without BP who did not participate in CWPT was also investigated on the same variables. Results are particularly encouraging, as significant findings were obtained on many of the measures for all boys who participated in CWPT. Furthermore, in addition to the impressive academic improvements, important gains were observed on the social status and domain-specific perceptions of boys with BP. Implications regarding implementation of CWPT with additional populations of children with diverse needs will be discussed as it relates to the inclusive movement.</description><creator>Karagiannakis, Anastasia.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Problem youth.</subject><subject>Self-perception.</subject><subject>Peer-group tutoring of students.</subject><subject>Social status.</subject><title>Classwide peer tutoring : social status and self-concept of boys with and without behaviour problems</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5t34sn929.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2801pk869</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vx021j71f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:01:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is an empirical assessment of the readiness of The Gambia for regional integration and is presented in two studies. The first is on the optimality of the Sene-Gambia sub-region as a currency area and the second is on trade facilitation effects of the Sene-Gambia Confederation on The Gambian economy. The first study uses three methods to determine the optimality of the Sene-Gambia as a currency area. The first method is a reduced VAR to examine the response of the Senegalese and The Gambian economies to external shocks emanating from France, the United Kingdom (UK) and United States of America (USA). The second method is a co-integration analysis on Generalized Purchasing Power Parity (GPPP) to determine the existence of a co-integrating relationship between the exchange rates of the Gambian dalasi and Senegalese CFA franc and their consumer price indices. The third method assesses the similarity between the two economies as countries wishing to form an optimal currency area should not be diametrically different in their economic structure or else the relationship would not be mutually beneficial and the resulting union may not be stable. The results support the optimality of Sene-Gambia as a currency area. Given this optimality, the second study uses an error-corrected gravity model to determine the trade facilitation effects of the Sene-Gambia Confederation on The Gambian economy.

In particular, the study investigated the impact of two aspects of multimedia instruction on the target grammar development: (a) the type of past tense targeted in instruction, prototypical (i.e., emergent perfective and imperfective forms) and non-prototypical (i.e., advanced perfective and imperfective forms), and (b) learners' readiness for non-prototypical past. The questions were: (a) Is multimedia instruction on non-prototypical past more effective at facilitating past tense improvement than multimedia instruction on prototypical past? (b) Does the L2 learners' past tense readiness mediate the effects of multimedia instruction? To investigate these questions, two multimedia environments with four one-hour lessons were implemented over four weeks in seven university classes in Mexico. Lessons were identical between environments, integrating interactive written/aural narratives and video cartoons to facilitate meaning-oriented past tense production and comprehension. The environments included high past tense frequency, visual enhancement, input processing instruction and feedback to draw learners' attention to past tense. Environments differed only in past tense type: one required prototypical past; the other required non-prototypical past. Using a past tense test, learners (n = 54) were classified as non-ready or ready for non-prototypical past and assigned to one environment. Past tense production and comprehension were assessed using three counterbalanced instruments before, immediately after, and three weeks after instruction. ANOVAs revealed that the environment's past tense type did not have an impact on learners' past tense production growth, whereas learners' past tense readiness did. While non-ready learners exhibited past tense growth immediately after instruction, ready learners did three weeks after instruction. Both groups improved past tense use in accordance with patterns that characterize the acquisition of the perfective and imperfective distinction. No immediate past tense improvement occurred in the comprehension tests, in which the perfective and imperfective differentiation from aural input constituted a challenge. Aspects of the multimedia instruction design and implementation that influenced the treatment results are discussed.</description><creator>Izquierdo, Manuel Jesús.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Language and languages -- Computer-assisted instruction.</subject><subject>French language -- Study and teaching -- Foreign speakers.</subject><title>Multimedia environments in the foreign language classroom : effects on the acquisition of the French perfective and imperfective distinction</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5138jj13s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m900nz26f</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Second Language Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z603r216w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:01:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Education is the area most conducive to fostering the dispositions that are intrinsic or instrumental to liberal democracy, structuring relations both between citizens and with the state. Indeed, citizenship theory has become increasingly concerned with the normative force attributed to political sociology. Such theories attempt to reconcile individual autonomy with the promotion and flourishing of collective identities, as expressions of popular sovereignty and as legitimating principles for liberal frameworks. The study introduces multinational democracies as a challenge to liberal justificatory frameworks; and as associations that more easily lend themselves to case-specific, historical and contextual analysis. Through the normative lens of the socio-political conditions characteristic of a multinational democracy, a closer look at the debates that have informed the contours of citizenship in Canada and Quebec is followed by a theoretical defence of multinational citizenship. Indeed, it is argued that liberalism, conceptualized as a society of equal individuals, cannot in itself provide answers to questions about the identitive boundaries and democratic legitimacy of particular communities. In terms of citizenship education, the fact of national pluralism, often conceived as a theoretical anomaly, is hardly addressed in the literature on the proper aims and approaches to education, yet at the same time liberal justificatory schemes are for the most part inadequate as normative guides. The study then assesses the citizenship components of the Quebec Education Program, as a guidepost for the ideal of citizenship sought through education, and argues that its approach and aims disregard the politically-salient variables necessary for the flourishing of multinational citizenship. The ends of citizenship in such policy documents rest upon the development, among individuals, of abstract, procedural, apolitical and universal competencies that can very well apply in any situation regardless of spatio-temporal contingencies, a clean break from much of the collective conflicts, contestation and interdependence that have characterized citizenship in Canada. The dissertation outlines a theory of multinational citizenship education, accounting for the flourishing of individual self-enactment as well as the dispositions and identities through which popular sovereignty is deemed to be legitimate. Finally, I respond to some projected criticisms of the justificatory framework developed here.</description><creator>Iacovino, Raffaele, 1973-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Civics, Canadian -- Study and teaching -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Political socialization -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Multicultural education -- Québec (Province).</subject><title>Multinational citizenship and education : assessing the Quebec education program</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bc386p13r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z603r216w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5h73q068m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:01:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This research examines the ways that socially mediated writing processes facilitate membership in communities of practice. Writing practices are located within rhetorical contexts and as newcomers to a community participate in community practices, they learn to recognize the rhetorical context in which they are writing. As their competence in the rhetorical context increases, they move from a position of peripheral membership in that community to a position of full participation or membership. Drawing on theories of practice and genre to understand the ways that writing practices form communities and shape membership, the research investigates the Canadian Association for the Study of Language and Learning (CASLL) and a writing process called inkshedding. The study uses a variety of qualitative methods to examine the ways that learning to inkshed facilitates (and sometimes frustrates) membership in CASLL. Each stage of the inkshedding activity is presented as a stage in membership. The initial stage of writing in inkshedding engenders feelings of anxiety that confront newcomers in their peripheral position. The circulation of texts illustrates the different ways that texts can be read, moving newcomers either to increased participation in the collective or leaving them on the periphery. The subsequent publication of selected texts mirrors the ways that newcomers may successfully become full participants. This study of writing practices and community membership contributes to a growing body of literature that demonstrates the central role that writing plays in the development of collectives. It is significant because it offers a detailed account of a process whereby individuals become full members of a community of practice through writing practices and thus supports notions of writing as socially situated. It also supports notions that community membership is attained through gradually increasing participation in community practices.</description><creator>Horne, Miriam E.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Social learning.</subject><subject>Writing.</subject><subject>English language -- Rhetoric -- Study and teaching.</subject><title>Community membership through socially situated writing processes : a journey of inkshedding into Inkshed</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/37720h53q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5h73q068m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8k71nm807</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:01:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study is an investigation of Kant's empirical realism as a response to the problem of intentionality. The former is the thesis that what we are related to in perception are the empirically mind-independent objects all around us in the spatio-temporal world. The latter is the problem of how thoughts come to have objective purport---how they come to represent states of the world. I argue that Kant has a sophisticated theory of how our 'faculty of cognition' puts us, as subject's of thought, in direct contact with the objective world. This theory shows us how intentionality is possible by showing us how thought is normatively constrained by the external world in perception. I articulate the theory by examining some of Kant's transcendental proofs in the Transcendental Aesthetic and Analytic. I claim that these proofs demonstrate that there are universal and necessary constraints on how our faculty of cognition operates. These constraints guarantee that the problem of intentionality is solved. Such transcendental proofs thus justify our taking ourselves to be engaged in the ongoing process of knowledgeably adjusting a view of the world under the auspices of rational criticism. In other words, the a priori forms of cognition that Kant argues we possess, allow us to see the latter process as justified. For if we made no contact in thinking at all with the world, it would be hard to see such justification as warranted.</description><creator>Grist, Matthew.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Kant, Immanuel, 1724-1804.</subject><subject>Intentionality (Philosophy) -- History -- 18th century.</subject><title>Kant and the problem of intentionality</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2b88qg76j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8k71nm807</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Philosophy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hq37vs13c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:01:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>My dissertation examines the knowledge culture of ordinary Scots in late-18 th Scotland and early-19th century Canada from a microhistorical perspective. In 1803 a branch of the Brodie family from Lochwinnoch parish, Renfrewshire in western Scotland emigrated to Montreal in Lower Canada. In so doing they created a direct link between the knowledge cultures of late-18 th century Scotland in which they had grown up and that of colonial Montreal. The Brodies' intellectual and cultural formation is explored through the prism, first, of the family's consumption and production of knowledge in Scotland and second, their reproduction and embodiment of that Scottish knowledge in Canada. The dissertation comprises four linked studies addressing different facets of widely-held claims of Scotland's distinctively high rates of literacy at the turn of the 19th century and of the disproportionate contributions of ordinary Scots to British colonies such as Canada. Despite the virtual absence of studies addressing the issue from the perspective of the ordinary Scot, the idea of a widely and democratically educated Scottish population---captured in the expression the "democratic intellect"---has been an important facet of Scottish identity at home and abroad for over two hundred years. The dissertation concludes that the idea of Scotland's "democratic intellect" does indeed have historical reality, but not in the way that many historians have suggested. A close reading of the intellectual and cultural material the Brodies consumed and produced reveals the inapplicability of the concept of a "democratic intellect" as an expression conveying the idea of the popular Scottish-mind as a product of elite institutions. In Scotland the Brodies exercised agency and independence in acquiring knowledge that surpassed basic literacy skills at the parish school. They wove together facets from a folk culture with select ideas from the Scottish Enlightenment to produce distinctive intellectual and cultural values based upon the concept of the primitive or the folk. Contrary to the 18th century elite invention of the folk as a vessel bearing the essential and anti-modern spirit of the nation, the Brodie helped advance the folk as a forward-looking group identity that included mental cultivation and independence of mind as core values.</description><creator>Gibson, Sarah Katherine.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Scotland -- Intellectual life -- 19th century.</subject><subject>Scotland -- Intellectual life -- 18th century.</subject><subject>Brody family.</subject><subject>Scots -- Québec (Province) -- History.</subject><title>The emigration of Adam Smith's Ploughman : a case study of the intellectual culture of Scots emigrants to Lower Canada 1760-1850</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4t64gr882.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hq37vs13c</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:f4752m49n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:01:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This research aims at three goals: (1) To know if the placement trajectory of children in foster care until majority influences their social and personal adjustment; (2) To know the impact of maintaining, or not maintaining contact with at least one of the biological parents on the child's social and personal adjustment; (3) To understand these children's perspectives concerning the advantages and disadvantages of having contact, or not with one or both biological parents. This exploratory and transversal research is conducted with children from the Centres jeunesse de 1'Outaouais. It contains a quantitative part which describes the characteristics, socio-demographic data and present life conditions of children studied. Then, a descriptive and retrospective study of the placement trajectory of children is done to examine its influence on social and personal adjustment of those children. Also, a comparative analysis of social and personal adjustment is completed between the group of children with contact and the one where contact was not maintained. The research contains a qualitative part presenting children's opinions set down during a semi-structured interview regarding their outlook on the advantages and disadvantages of maintaining or not maintaining contact. The results of this research show there are no significant differences in social and personal adjustment between the children with contacts and those who do not have contacts, depending their placement trajectory. Still, children from the group where contact was not maintained show greater risk of having difficulties in social and personal adjustment during adolescence than the children in the group with contact. Despite this, children from this group perceive more advantages than disadvantages in not having contacts with their parents. Conversely, children from the other group recognize more advantages than disadvantages in maintaining contacts with their parents. It is therefore important to maintain contacts with the biological parents whenever the situation allows it and to keep children's perspectives into account during the procedure of contact clauses involving themselves.</description><creator>Carignan, Louise.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Social adjustment.</subject><subject>Child psychology.</subject><subject>Adjustment (Psychology)</subject><subject>Foster children -- Family relationships.</subject><title>Analyse de l'adaptation sociale et personnelle des jeunes placés jusqu'à leur majorité en fonction de leur trajectoire de placement et du maintien ou du non maintien des contacts avec leurs parents biologiques</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5999n694r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f4752m49n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cc08hk24x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:01:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of the current study was to identify predictors of relative competence for a group of inner-city adolescents with life experiences that are marked by particularly chronic maladjustment. Sixty-seven school-aged males between the ages of 8 and 20 years of age who were enrolled in an extended school year program targeting a group of students most at-risk for academic, emotional and behavioral regression during the summer break participated in the current study. Within the context of significant adversity, and the view that these students generally face severe problems adapting to the demands of school and the communities in which they live, self-other processing and non-verbal intelligence were tested as personal attributes that would promote competence despite the circumstances of demographic risk and negative life experiences reported by the students. Self-other processing was examined within the context of psychosocial maturity, which is the ability to recognize and coordinate multiple dimensions of interpersonal experiences and demonstrate competence in communication and problem solving. Separately, the ability to determine one's social status was tested as a second component of self-other processing. These factors were examined as a set of predictors of adjustment across multiple domains of competence including: academic performance, behaviors in the classroom, peer acceptance, being a target of victimization, as well as symptoms of anxiety and depression. In the analyses, non-verbal intelligence and the ability to accurately rate one's social status were identified as resources that predicted features of academic, behavioural, and social competence. Psychosocial maturity was identified as contributing to emotional well-being, however, the compensatory benefits did not compensate for the level of adversity reported by the participants, and psychosocial maturity did not predict emotional well-being when considered within the context of risk. Despite the context of this high-risk inner city environment, and the histories of this group of students, features of self-other processing and non-verbal intelligence distinguished those who adapted better to the demands of their environment, from those who did not.</description><creator>Blidner, Aron.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Resilience (Personality trait)</subject><subject>Urban youth -- United States -- Psychology.</subject><subject>Self.</subject><title>Linking self-other processing to resilience among inner city students</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dn39x487m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cc08hk24x</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4m90dz86r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:01:08Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A Posner-like visual orienting task was used to compare social and nonsocial endogenous orienting among children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and typically developing children matched on nonverbal mental age of approximately 8.5 years. This comparison was accomplished in the visual modality to avoid cross-modality task demands and with a particular focus on equating the stimuli with regard to complexity as these factors may have influenced earlier findings of a social orienting impairment among persons with ASDs. Participants were asked to detect social (face) and nonsocial (mixed face) targets on the basis of social (hand point) and nonsocial (arrow) cues, under Stimulus Onset Asynchrony (SOA) conditions of 175 ms and 650 ms. The typically developing children and the children with ASDs displayed strong orienting effects that were indicative of similar endogenous orienting abilities. The 650 ms SOA was also facilitative for the children with ASDs and for the typically developing children. Group differences did emerge in the interaction of cue type and SOA, where the children with ASDs demonstrated intact social orienting, but only at the SOA of 650 ms. The findings from this study do not support a general notion of social orienting impairment among children with ASDs, but rather, suggest that social orienting abilities may be contingent upon processing time for this group.</description><creator>Flanagan, Tara.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Visual perception.</subject><subject>Orientation.</subject><subject>Autism in children.</subject><title>A point of departure in the comparison of social and nonsocial visual orienting among persons with autism spectrum disorders /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5x21tk05d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4m90dz86r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:j3860b38d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:01:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The opening sections of some exegetical Midrashim deal with the issues of authorship and inspiration, time of composition, historical setting, genre, methods of interpretation, themes, and literary forms and unity of their biblical book. This is the same type of material that is found in the introductions to medieval rabbinic Bible commentaries (written in Hebrew). In the Midrashim, this phenomenon occurs within the midrashic comments on 1:1, as opposed to outside the scriptural verse order in a separate introduction like the commentaries. Therefore, I have designated it by the phrase "Inner-Midrashic Introduction." Goldberg's form analysis of rabbinic literature is applied to these opening sections of the Midrashim. It establishes criteria for isolating propositions that contribute to thematic discourse, and criteria for controlling what appear to be unthematic elements. The analysis reveals the new prototypical form "Inner-Midrashic Introduction" as a thematic discourse on introductory issues to biblical books. It is found in Midrashim on the Torah, i.e., in Sifra on Leviticus and Leviticus Rabbah, and on the Writings, i.e., in Song of Songs Rabbah, Lamentations Rabbah, Midrash Psalms, and Midrash Mishle. These provide the basis for describing the prototypical form "Inner-Midrashic Introduction," and they also supply specific examples of its literary realizations. In order to corroborate the existence of the Inner-Midrashic Introduction as an introductory form, a select number of medieval rabbinic commentary introductions are analyzed in terms of their formal, thematic, and material characteristics, revealing that a certain degree of continuity exists between them and the Inner-Midrashic Introductions. This analysis also reveals the new form the "Inner-Commentary Introduction." Since the origin of introductions to medieval rabbinic Bible commentaries has been traced to non-Jewish models from the Muslim and Christian spheres, i.e., to the ṣadr, muḳaddima, and the prooemium and its scholastic counterpart the accessus ad auctores, the prior existence of the Inner-Midrashic Introduction and its continuity in Inner-Commentary Introductions and separate introductions are important discoveries for the history of Bible interpretation in general, and of Jewish Bible interpretation in particular. Now the Inner-Midrashic Introduction can take its rightful place in that history.</description><creator>Distefano, Michel.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Midrash -- History and criticism.</subject><title>Inner-Midrashic introductions to the interpretation of individual Biblical books and their influence on the form and themes of introductions to medieval rabbinic Bible commentaries</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8s45qd36f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/j3860b38d</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Jewish Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xp68kk78c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:01:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The nature and effect of two approaches to instruction in mathematics were studied from a situated cognition perspective, which emphasizes the pivotal role of discourse in knowledge comprehension. Typically, students must construct conceptual knowledge representations that integrate different types of information from diverse resources. Currently, little is known about how students' cognitive processes are influenced by distinct instructional approaches. The study focused on two problem-based methods: conceptually-focused instruction (CFI) and procedurally-focused instruction (PR). Both methods implemented common principles based on cognitive theories. Moreover, different characteristics were identified in the cognitive theories having different research traditions as their source. These differences provided insights for devising the two instructional approaches. A one-on-one tutoring setting was implemented for investigation. Of the two individual students in each matched pair, one was randomly assigned to CFI, and the other to PFI. There were a total of twelve one-on-one tutoring sessions, with six grade nine students in each condition. The researcher, an experienced high school mathematics teacher and counselor for the French Montreal School Board, was also the tutor in both conditions. The same two problems on linear functions, with gradual increase in difficulty, were solved in each method. Points of disjunction of approaches were achieved through variation in the type and degree of explanation (modeling strategy in Problem 1) and of scaffolding (coaching strategy in Problem 2). The results indicated that the different instructional conditions were implemented with consistency. Within the problem-based instruction framework and for the same problem-solving activity, it was possible for the tutor to maintain the focus on concepts vs. procedures. Although both approaches were equally beneficial to students, they affected the students' cognitive activity differently. Students' talk was more procedural in both approaches, but their speech was more balanced between concepts and procedures in CFI than in PH, indicating that students' cognitive processes were transferred differently from the modeling to the coaching discourse. These findings have implications for policymakers in education and for Quebec Ministry of Education standards. Future research is recommended to extend such findings to other populations of students and to additional types of teaching approaches.</description><creator>Deslauriers, Denise.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Mathematics -- Study and teaching.</subject><subject>Problem solving.</subject><title>Students' problem solving and understanding in learning mathematics through conceptually- and procedurally-focused instruction : a situated discourse approach</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d217qt50d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xp68kk78c</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5d86p390w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:01:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This research is about the life and material conditions of existence of Xhosa people living in three informal settlements of East London (now part of Buffalo City) in South Africa. Most observers see such unplanned settlements as a radical shift away from the groups' traditional rural homestead, some describing them as "neo-vernacular" since---like the vernacular dwelling---these are built from the materials coming from the surrounding environment. The research went beyond this perception and rather proposed that despite changes in the building forms, materials and techniques, the informal Xhosa urban settlements are still---consciously or not---governed by Xhosa traditional rules. To demonstrate this hypothesis, the study attempted to understand the culture of the group through the review of the literature dealing with the Xhosa life and customs in the group's traditional rural setting. Then, it established the evolutionary process of the Xhosa architecture, which was also (re)integrated not only in the history of South African architecture but also in the whole architecture history's continuum. Next, followed the description of the elements that have been found in the three informal settlements as well as in the dwellings and plots that have been selected for the case study. Finally, from the comparison between the elements found in the three squatter settlements selected and the traditional Xhosa setting it is concluded that the traditional Xhosa culture has survived in the three informal settlements of East London. Its persistence has been confirmed in the rituals and everyday activities, the objects, spaces and buildings created, as well as in the way they are constructed, used or lived in.</description><creator>D'Aragon, Jean.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Xhosa (African people) -- Housing -- South Africa -- Buffalo City.</subject><subject>Xhosa (African people) -- Dwellings -- South Africa -- Buffalo City.</subject><subject>Squatter settlements -- South Africa -- Buffalo City.</subject><title>Straw, sticks, mud and resistance : development and evolution of the South African Xhosa dwelling and settlement</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/js956k590.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5d86p390w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gx41mn49c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:01:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis consists of three essays. The firsts essay looks at the optimal export policy in the context of an vertically related industry with differentiated products, and analyze effects of the degree of product substitutability and market structure on the determination of such policy. It is shown that results obtained in a similar model with homogenous goods rivalry no longer hold when the goods are differentiated. Indeed, the degree of product substitutability plays an important role in the determination of export policies, it also determine whether a country can be better off under a trade policy war compared to free trade. The use of differentiated product setting also allows one to compare export policies and countries' welfare between Cournot and Bertrand competitions. It is found that the results of the comparison are also sensitive to the degree of product substitutability. The second essay presents a model of tariff war involving n resource-importing countries and a coalition of resource-exporting countries that acts as a resource-cartel, coordinating the extraction paths of their resource-extracting firms. We deal with two different tariff war scenarios. In the first scenario, which we call the bilateral monopoly scenario, all resource-importing countries form a coalition that imposes a common tariff rate on the exhaustible resource. In the second scenario, the resource-importing countries act independently, each imposing its own tariff rate. We compare the outcomes under the two tariff war scenarios and with the free-trade outcome. In our model, it turns out that, given the rate of discount, there is a corresponding threshold level of the marginal cost parameter beyond which the resource-importing countries would prefer bilateral monopoly to world-wide free trade. The higher is the rate of discount, the greater is the corresponding threshold marginal cost level. We study the effects of asymmetry between resource-importing countries on the welfare of the exporting country, and of the importing countries. In the final section, we examine the welfare consequence of splitting the resource stock into two (possibly unequal) parts to serve the two import markets. It turns out that such market segregation is harmful to the exporting country. The third essay analyzes the dynamic rivalry by two firms in the cultural goods market. Consumers are assumed to have homogeneous valuation of one good and heterogeneous valuation of the other good. One of the firm can choose the quality of its product from a continuum of quality levels. This firm is the far-sighted firm in the dynamic model. Consumer preferences evolve gradually over time. This evolution is driven by a network effect and a depreciation effect. The network effect is a function of the current market shares of the two firms. We consider the case where one firm is the dynamic optimizer and the other firm is myopic. The far-sighted firm solves its problem by manipulating its current market share, which in turn affects the evolution of consumer preferences. We show there exist two steady states, one of which is a stable in the saddle-point sense, while the other is unstable. Our comparative static analysis of the stable steady state shows that the steady state quality level of the far-sighted firm is increasing in the discount factor and decreasing in the cost and the speed of adjustment parameters. Moreover, the steady state quality level is lower than the equilibrium quality level of the static model.</description><creator>Chou, Jui-Hsien Stephen, 1978-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Competition -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Tariff -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Commercial policy -- Mathematical models.</subject><title>Essays on strategic trade policies, differentiated products, and exhaustible resources</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b8515r947.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gx41mn49c</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Economics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:d791sk836</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:01:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Three studies were conducted to examine the acoustic markers of sarcasm in English and in Cantonese, and the manner in which such markers are perceived across these languages. The first study consisted of acoustic analyses of sarcastic utterances spoken in English to verify whether particular prosodic cues correspond to English sarcastic speech. Native English speakers produced utterances expressing sarcasm, sincerity, humour, or neutrality. Measures taken from each utterance included fundamental frequency (F0), amplitude, speech rate, harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR, to probe voice quality), and one-third octave spectral values (to probe resonance). The second study was conducted to ascertain whether specific acoustic features marked sarcasm in Cantonese and how such features compare with English sarcastic prosody. The elicitation and acoustic analysis methods from the first study were applied to similarly-constructed Cantonese utterances spoken by native Cantonese speakers. Direct acoustic comparisons between Cantonese and English sarcasm exemplars were also made. To further test for cross-linguistic prosodic cues of sarcasm and to assess whether sarcasm could be conveyed across languages, a cross-linguistic perceptual study was then performed. A subset of utterances from the first two studies was presented to naive listeners fluent in either Cantonese or English. Listeners had to identify the attitude in each utterance regardless of language of presentation. Sarcastic utterances in English (regardless of text) were marked by lower mean F0 and reductions in HNR and F0 standard deviation (relative to comparison attitudes). Resonance changes, reductions in both speech rate and F0 range signalled sarcasm in conjunction with some vocabulary terms. By contrast, higher mean F0, amplitude range reductions, and F0 range restrictions corresponded with sarcastic utterances spoken in Cantonese regardless of text. For Cantonese, reduced speech rate and higher HNR interacted with certain vocabulary to mark sarcasm. Sarcastic prosody was most distinguished from acoustic features corresponding to sincere utterances in both languages. Direct English-Cantonese comparisons between sarcasm tokens confirmed cross-linguistic differences in sarcastic prosody. Finally, Cantonese and English listeners could identify sarcasm in their native languages but identified sarcastic utterances spoken in the unfamiliar language at chance levels. It was concluded that particular acoustic cues marked sarcastic speech in Cantonese and English, and these patterns of sarcastic prosody were specific to each language.</description><creator>Cheang, Henry Sing Ho, 1975-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Cross-Cultural Comparison.</subject><subject>Speech.</subject><subject>Speech Acoustics.</subject><subject>Speech Perception.</subject><subject>Irony.</subject><subject>English language.</subject><subject>Cantonese dialects.</subject><title>The sounds of sarcasm in English and Cantonese : a cross-linguistic production and perception study</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2z10wv07p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d791sk836</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Communication Sciences and Disorders</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5q47rs48q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:01:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Virtual teams---defined as groups of geographically-dispersed individuals working together to accomplish a common goal and who rely heavily on information technologies (ITs) to communicate and coordinate their work---have recently captured the attention of numerous scholars and practitioners. The ability of virtual teams to cross various boundaries (e.g., geographical, temporal, cultural, etc.) has made them an attractive means for leveraging the resources of distributed organizations. However, the factors and mechanisms that influence their performance remain mostly unclear. To address this issue, this thesis proposes three essays where each contributes to better understand the phenomenon of virtual team performance in a specific way. In the first essay, an integrative model of virtual team performance is developed and used to review the extant empirical literature. This exercise has lead to the identification of a set of key direct and indirect drivers of virtual team performance. The second essay offers a knowledge-based view of virtual team performance and proposes a conceptual framework of knowledge integration effectiveness in virtual teams. The framework identifies three integration mechanisms enabled by information technologies and describes how the usage of those mechanisms can facilitate knowledge integration effectiveness in virtual teams. The framework also outlines the role of common knowledge as a key factor leading to effective knowledge integration in virtual teams, and discusses the linkage between knowledge integration effectiveness and virtual team performance. Finally, the third essay provides an empirical demonstration of the conceptual framework of knowledge integration effectiveness developed in the second essay. The framework is tested with 700 individuals working in 102 existing knowledge-based VTs and who use IT to coordinate the use of their knowledge inputs across boundaries. Results indicate that the impact of IT on knowledge integration effectiveness is fully mediated by the common developed within VTs about their collective task, the distribution of expertise, the IT-enabled communication structure of the team, and members' specialized knowledge domains. Consistent with the premises of the first two essays, knowledge integration effectiveness was positively associated with VT performance. Overall, this thesis brings a new perspective for understanding the phenomenon of virtual team performance, describes gaps in current research, and recommends avenues for future research.</description><creator>Caya, Olivier.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Information technology.</subject><subject>Virtual work teams.</subject><subject>Knowledge management.</subject><title>Information technologies, knowledge integration, and performance in virtual teams</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/765374581.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5q47rs48q</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Desautels Faculty of Management</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:st74cv322</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:01:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The study of the patristic quotations has long been appreciated as an important source in New Testament Textual Criticism. The unique value of the church Fathers lies in the fact that we know when and where a father wrote. Their citations of Scripture, both in their expositional and polemical writings, often help the researcher identify the relative antiquity and geographical location of variant readings. The justification for studying the New Testament text of Didymus the Blind can be easily expressed. Born c. 313 and later head of the catechetical school in Alexandria, Didymus was endowed with a prodigious memory and authored numerous commentaries on the OT; he has proven to be a mine of wealth for the state of the text of the New Testament in fourth-century Egypt. Previous studies of the text of the Gospels and Pauline corpus in Didymus have demonstrated the close relationship of his Gospel text to the Alexandrian/Egyptian form of the text, a text favoured by most textual critics today. This fact lends further importance to the present project. The present thesis therefore will analyse the quotations of Didymus in the remaining New Testament literature (Acts, Catholic Epistles and Revelation). A complete data base of allusions and citations will be provided, which will make it possible to represent Didymus more fully and accurately in the apparatus of critical editions of the NT, thus increasing the overall confidence in the use of this Father's textual data.</description><creator>Arcieri, Mike.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Didymus, the Blind, ca. 313-ca. 398.</subject><title>The text of Didymus the Blind in the Book of Acts, the Catholic Epistles, and the Apocalypse /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9k41zj02q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/st74cv322</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Religious Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):16350</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
