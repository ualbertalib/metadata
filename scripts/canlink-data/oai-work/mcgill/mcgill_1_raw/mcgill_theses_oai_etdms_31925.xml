Several complexity issues of fast identification are investigated. Experiment design and model selection, two important components for achieving fast identification, are separated by splitting the estimation error into inherent and representation errors, which are functions of the experiment and the model sets respectively. The optimal inherent error, a measure of the time complexity of identification, is introduced as a notion of n-width (time n-width) related to the Gel'fand n-width. The optimal representation error is related to the Kolmogorov n-width. Estimates of the various n-widths are obtained systematically for a class of data sets covering many cases encountered in practical control problems. The input design problem is further explored in cases where the input can be designed only to the extent of modifying its ensemble properties. The identifying capability of an input ensemble is characterized in general in terms of the gap metric. This general characterization is reduced to a certain spectrum flatness property of the input in the case of finite impulse response models. Bounds on the inherent error are given in terms of the n-width and spectrum flatness. Several robust identification algorithms are proposed as well. It is shown that in the continuous-time case, although it is possible to identify a system arbitrarily accurately on an arbitrarily short time interval by increasing the sampling rate and signal-to-noise ratio, the identification speed is limited for a fixed signal-to-noise ratio. An asymptotically accurate lower bound on the optimal identification speed is given, again in terms of Gel'fand n-width. A logarithmic integral characterization for the optimal inputs is obtained via the theory of quasianalytic functions. The representation and estimation problems for continuous-time systems are reduced to a discrete-time case. A casual reconstruction procedure is given, together with an error estimate. Finally, the results on fast identification are applied to systems in which the law governing the evolution of the uncertain elements is not time invariant. Such systems can not be identified accurately. The inherent error is bounded in the case of slow time-variation and shown to increase with the variation rate.</description><creator>Lin, Lin</creator><contributor>Zames, George (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Fast identification for robust adaptive control : a metric complexity approach</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6108vd06t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zg64tn561</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6m311q94p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:29:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This is a history of Wilson College, Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, from 1868 until 1981. It attempts to discover why Wilson, a small, private liberal arts college for women, managed to survive despite financial and enrolment problems which forced many other institutions to close in the 1960s and 1970s. This thesis locates Wilson historically among institutions of higher learning in the United States; traces the development of the College in terms of its founding, governance, curriculum, and campus life; and examines events leading up to Wilson's near demise in 1979. Wilson's small size, its practice of encouraging congenial interaction between students and faculty, its commitment to teaching, its long term affiliation with the Presbyterian Church, and its close ties with the community of Chambersburg are cited as factors contributing to Wilson's renaissance. What makes Wilson more interesting than other small women's colleges of its class was the fact that its alumnae, students, and faculty successfully fought the Trustees' decision to close the College because of financial pressures and dwindling enrolment. In 1979 Wilson became the only college in the United States ever ordered to remain open by a court of law.</description><creator>Longacre, Judith Evans</creator><contributor>Gillett, Margaret (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Wilson College (Chambersburg, Pa.)</subject><subject>Women's colleges -- Pennsylvania -- History</subject><title>Wilson : the college that refused to die</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0p096858q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6m311q94p</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kp78gh94k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:29:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study explores gender differences in the ways teachers interact with high school students from disrupted families. Four language arts teachers and five mathematics teachers from an urban high school in Montreal, Quebec were interviewed and observed in their classroom interactions with students. The findings revealed that gender differences were related to the teachers' perceptions of professional roles, and were reinforced by the segmentation of teaching and guidance responsibilities in urban schools. Female teachers were inclined to consider teaching as related to the upbringing of youths, and perceived themselves as responsible for the academic and social-emotional development of their students. Male teachers, in contrast, viewed their role as subject-specialists to disseminate knowledge. These role perceptions strongly influenced teachers' classroom interactions with students from disrupted families.</description><creator>Lo, Elsa</creator><contributor>Eiseman, Thomas Owen (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Children of divorced parents</subject><subject>Teacher-student relationships</subject><title>Gender differences in teachers' interactions with students from disrupted families : a case study of language arts and mathematics teachers in an urban high school</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7h149r176.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kp78gh94k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:dj52w6329</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:29:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Let $u sb0$ be the harmonic extension of the function f (defined on $R sp{n})$ to $R sbsp{+}{n+1}$.

In contrast to other Photobacterium species, the luxF gene, located between luxB and luxE, was absent. Three genes immediately downstream of luxG in P. leiognathi have also been identified and shown to correspond in sequence and organization to the second, third, and fourth genes of the riboflavin operon of Bacillus subtilis. In Photobacterium phosphoreum, four genes involved in riboflavin synthesis were also found immediately downstream of luxG and their functions identified. These rib genes code for riboflavin synthetase, 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate synthetase, lumazine synthetase, and GTP cyclohydrolase II, respectively. Demonstration of the close linkage of the lux and rib genes in luminescent bacteria is of particular importance for understanding the regulation of light emission as reduced riboflavin 5$ sp prime$-phosphate along with a fatty aldehyde and oxygen are the substrates for the bacterial luminescent reaction. Synthesis of the fatty aldehyde substrate for the bioluminescent reaction is catalyzed by a lux-specific fatty acid reductase complex coded by the luxCDE genes. For the first time, expression of the Photobacterium lux genes in Escherichia coli was strong enough to detect fatty acid reductase (LuxCE) and acyl-CoA reductase (LuxC) activities in extracts. Using site specific mutagenesis, each of the three conserved cysteine residues of P. phosphoreum and P. leiognathi LuxC was converted to a serine residue, and the mutated reductase expressed in a mutant E. coli strain, 43R. Examination of the properties of the mutant proteins resulted in the identification of Cys286 in the acylation site of Photobacterium acyl-CoA reductases providing the basis for understanding the transfer and channelling of fatty acyl groups for reduction to fatty aldehyde for the bioluminescent reaction.</description><creator>Lee, Chan Yong</creator><contributor>Meighen, E.

High plane of nutrition did not increase milk production but negatively affected reproduction and health. In addition, high plane of nutrition decreased growth hormone (GH) concentration and increased prolactin concentration during gestation. There was no effect of previous plane of nutrition on peripartum concentrations of hormones. Milk production was positively correlated with GH concentrations, but was negatively correlated to concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1) concentrations postpartum. The effect of GH administration on mammary vasculature and on paracrine secretion of growth factors was investigated in lactating and non-lactating dairy cows. The injection of GH induced a linear increase of IGF-1 concentration in blood and mammary primary lymph, but did not affect concentrations of prostaglandin E$ sb2$ (PGE$ sb2$) concentrations. However, the rate of IGF-1 increase was slower in lymph than in blood, suggesting that blood is the source of most lymph IGF-I. Therefore, GH did not seem to affect paracrine secretion of IGF-1 and PGE$ sb2$ by the bovine mammary gland. Growth hormone administration induced a gradual increase in mammary blood flow in lactating cows while it remained constant in non-lactating animals. Changes in lymphatic, but not blood, concentrations of a stable metabolite of the vasodilatator prostacyclin I$ sb2$ parallelled the changes in blood flow. This indicates that local secretion of this vasodilatator may be responsible for the effect of GH on mammary blood flow. Mitogenic activity of mammary primary lymph samples taken at different physiological stages was evaluated on mammary epithelial and mammary fibroblast cell lines. The results indicate that the mitogenic activity of lymph in epithelial cells was not related to physiological stage but to PGE$ sb2$ concentration. In fibroblasts, mitogenic activity of lymph was not related to physiological stage or to the content in any of the growth factors assayed.</description><creator>Lacasse, Pierre</creator><contributor>Block, Elliot (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Udder -- Growth.</subject><subject>Heifers -- Nutrition.</subject><subject>Dairy cattle -- Feeding and feeds.</subject><subject>Milk yield.</subject><title>Influence of plane of nutrition, growth hormone and growth factors on mammary gland development and function</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nk322f75h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fn107065w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Animal Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:00000160n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:29:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The main objectives were: (1) to develop tools to aid in the design of enclosed agro-ecosystems, and (2) to use these tools to develop a prototype simulation-based control system. Three tools were developed: (1) a conceptual framework, (2) a (simulated) greenhouse system and (3) a simulation approach within OS/2. Part of the conceptual framework was dedicated to "conscious control", defined as a form of control practised by an entity that uses models of itself in its decision-making processes. The greenhouse system was composed of six modules (a simulation manager, a weather generator, a greenhouse model, a crop model, a Pavlovian controller and a cognitive controller), which were implemented under OS/2 as separate processes. The greenhouse system was used to develop a prototype simulation-based controller. Primarily, the role of the controller was to determine temperature setpoints that would minimize the heating load. The simulation model used by the controller was an artificial neural network. The controller adapted temperature setpoints to anticipated meteorological conditions and reduced greenhouse energy consumption, in comparison with a more traditional controller. Generally, the results showed the feasibility and illustrated some of the advantages of using simulation-based control. The research resulted in the definition of elements that will allow the creation of a methodological framework for the design of simulation-based control and, eventually, a theory of conscious control.</description><creator>Lacroix, René</creator><contributor>Kok, Robert (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Greenhouse management -- Computer simulation</subject><subject>Greenhouses -- Automatic control.</subject><subject>Greenhouses -- Environmental engineering -- Data processing.</subject><title>A framework for the design of simulation-based greenhouse control</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2514nm99q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/00000160n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Agricultural Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xd07gv13c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:29:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Prp20, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae homolog to the mammalian regulator of chromosome condensation, RCC1, binds to double-stranded (ds) DNA in vitro through a multi-component complex. Three members of this complex bind GTP in vitro. The Prp20 complex specifically loses its ability to bind dsDNA during DNA replication as determined by an in vitro assay using cell extracts from arrested cdc mutants. This loss of dsDNA-binding activity does not affect the proper organization of the nucleoplasm as was the case for the prp20-1 and prp20-7 mutants, suggesting a segregation exists in the biochemical activities of the Prp20 protein. Detailed analysis of Prp20 demonstrates that specific and highly conserved amino acids coordinate these distinct activities of the Prp20 complex. These essential residues are mainly located in the second and the third repeats of the amino terminus and the last two repeats of the carboxyl terminus of Prp20. Furthermore, mutations in the last two repeats are suppressed by Gsp1, one of the GTP-binding components of the Prp20 complex, but not the mutations in the amino-terminus of Prp20.</description><creator>Lee, Arianna</creator><contributor>Clark, Michael W.

The Navier-Stokes equations, written in the form of vorticity equations, are split into nonlinear convection and linear diffusion parts according to a fractional step method. Vorticity is modelled by discrete point vortices. Vortices are created on the surface to satisfy the zero tangential velocity boundary condition. Random walks are applied to the vortices to simulate the diffusion equation. Vortices are then convected in an inviscid calculation in the Lagrangian scheme to simulate the convection equation. The velocity of each vortex is calculated using the Clould-in-Cell method. The random vortex method is developed to simulate the flow around a circular cylinder with a splitter plate. A conformal transformation is used to map the cylinder with a splitter plate to a unit circular cylinder. The force coefficients and Strouhal number are presented for various lengths of the splitter plate and are in good agreement with experiments. The random vortex method has also been developed for the flow around a circular cylinder vibrating transverse to the flow in a channel. The results are presented for various values of Reynolds number, forcing frequency and vibration amplitudes. The effect of blockage on the drag coefficient is presented. The drag coefficient and vortex shedding frequency are shown to compare favourably with experimental results. The flow around a vibrating cylinder with a splitter plate is also simulated. The results are presented for various values of forcing frequency and lengths of the splitter plate. The flow around multiple stationary cylinders is also simulated. Also, results are presented for the flow around two cylinders, one of which is forced to oscillate in a transverse direction. The numerical results of Strouhal number are in reasonable agreement with experiments.</description><creator>Ghadiri Dehkordi, Behzad</creator><contributor>Price, S. J.

Mold cavity pressure plays an important role in determining the quality of the molded articles. The dynamic behaviour and control of cavity pressure were studied in this research project. The work deals with all phases of the process: filling, packing, and cooling. A real-time data acquisition and computer control system has been developed to assist the implementation of advanced control techniques for injection molding machine operation. Modularity and extensibility were emphasised in its development. The dynamics of cavity pressure during filling were investigated and found to be both non-linear and time-varying in relation to the hydraulic servo-valve opening which is the manipulated variable. A self-tuning control system was designed and tested for a wide range of conditions. The transition of the filling-to-packing was found to be best detected by the derivative of the cavity pressure. The dynamics of cavity pressure during packing were studied and modelled similarly as for filling. The self-tuning technique was successfully extended into the packing phase. Cavity pressure is essentially independent of the hydraulic servo-valve opening once the cavity gate freezes and the process enters the cooling phase. A cooling system was designed to provide quick manipulation of coolant temperature. Controlled pressure cooling time (CPCT) was proposed to represent the behaviour of cavity pressure during the cooling phase. Its dynamics in relation to coolant temperature were found to be best described as a first order system. A control system for CPCT was designed and successfully tested.</description><creator>Gao, Furong</creator><contributor>Patterson, W. I. (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Kamal, M. R.

As well as it reports on the manner in which fatigue and aminophylline affect the length-force properties of the diaphragm. First, I studied the effect of fatigue on diaphragm contractility as a function of sarcomere length using an in vitro rat diaphragm strips. Results indicated that fatigue resulted in disproportionately greater reduction of tetanic force at short sarcomere lengths. Second, I reconstructed the three-dimensional shape of the diaphragm to determine if in vitro results are physiologically relevant in humans. I estimated the changes in fibre length and shape that occurs with lung inflation from residual volume to total lung capacity in normal subjects. Results suggested that the inspiratory function of the human diaphragm can be entirely attributed to its length-force relationship rather than changes in shape under conditions of twitch phrenic nerve stimulations. Finally, I confirmed that fatigue caused a greater percent reduction of transdiaphragmatic pressure at high lung volume in response to single supramaximal shocks delivered bilaterally to the phrenic nerves at high lung volume; and demonstrated that aminophylline potentiated human diaphragm contractility more at high than at low lung volumes, both under fresh and fatigue conditions. I propose an explanation for the effect of fatigue and aminophylline on diaphragm contractility at different sarcomere lengths based on known actions of these factors and muscle shortening on excitation-contraction coupling mechanisms of skeletal muscles.</description><creator>Gauthier, Alain P.</creator><contributor>Macklem, P.

Chesnutt's writings challenged the central assumptions of his America's racial thinking. An important part of this challenge is the difference between the two discourses which dominate The Conjure Woman. The first uses ethnographic discourse to create "the Other;" the second effaces the differences between himself and other Americans. Unlike most of the other writers of his period, Chesnutt shows African-American men and women to be fully developed moral, ethical and emotional individuals; in his works slave-holders and those who sought to "redeem" the South were morally and ethically underdeveloped. Both his writings and his career demonstrate that African-Americans were capable of prospering as independent actors in a free labor market. While critical of the actions of America's legal system, unlike many of his contemporaries, Chesnutt believed that injustice began when racial thinking led legal actors to deviate from the established rules of common law.</description><creator>Greenfield, Nathan M., 1958-</creator><contributor>Ohlin, Peter (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Racism -- United States -- History</subject><subject>Chesnutt, Charles Waddell, 1858-1932</subject><title>"Their position[s] must be mined" : Charles W.

However, few data are available regarding interfacial tension between polymers due to experimental difficulties. Two devices, one based on the pendant drop method and another based on the spinning drop method, were constructed in this work to conduct an experimental study of interfacial tension between polymers. With both instruments, it was possible to view the drop in real time and to calculate the interfacial tension on-line. The following aspects were considered: special syringe design, the necking and capillary effects, in the pendant drop method, and sealing of the rotating tubes and density measurement in the spinning drop method. The two devices were shown to be reliable and complementary. A method to infer interfacial tension from transient measurements was suggested. Interfacial tension was measured for different polymer pairs. The effects of temperature, molecular weight, bimodal blending and molecular weight distribution were evaluated. The effect of adding compatibilizers was also studied. Surface analysis of the interfaces was performed using E.S.CA. to explain the experimental results. The experimental results were compared with the predictions of lattice theories and the square gradient theory. A strategy to evaluate the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter between polymers was developed. When this strategy was employed, theoretical predictions and experimental data showed good agreement for the influence of temperature and molecular weight on interfacial tension. However, the theory could not predict the effect of polydispersity on interfacial tension.</description><creator>Demarquette, Nicole Raymonde</creator><contributor>Kamal, M. R.

Tat trans-activates viral gene expression via the interaction with a RNA stem-loop structure termed TAR, which is localized in the 5$ sp prime$-untranslated region of all viral mRNAs. Tat specifically interacts with a three-nucleotide bulge in TAR through its arginine-rich RNA-binding domain. A minimum of six arginine residues as well as the position of one critical arginine residue within this basic domain are essential for the binding to TAR RNA. In the TAR RNA stem-loop, two basepairs directly above the three-nucleotide bulge are essential for interaction with Tat. A model is proposed which implicates one of these basepairs in a stable tertiary interaction with an essential residue of the single stranded bulge. This interaction stabilizes a bent TAR RNA structure and causes a widening of the major groove of the RNA, thereby exposing its hydrogen bonding surfaces for interaction with protein side chains. Distinct regions within the TAR stem above and below the three-nucleotide bulge cannot be substituted by deoxyribonucleotides but have to be ribonucleotides, suggesting an important role for phosphates of the RNA backbone in the interaction between Tat and TAR RNA.</description><creator>Delling, Ulrike</creator><contributor>Sonenberg, Nahum (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Structural and functional characterization of the interaction between the HIV-1 trans-activating protein Tat and TAR RNA</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3484zj25r.undefined</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8p58pf461</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:r781wh543</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:29:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis considers government finances in New France during the first half of the eighteenth century. By looking directly at government accounts from Canada and l'Ile Royale, and at the administrative structures which gave rise to them, it seeks to reconcile ostensibly rival quantitative and 'administrative' approaches to the literature on France's Ancien regime finances. Evidence is found to suggest that colonial finances emerged as an integral part of French naval finances, not as a result of deliberate policy, but as a by-product of the continued presence of naval troops in the colonies and of the early failure of the Domaine d'Occident to generate net revenue flows to France. Especially in the case of Canada, the accounts of the colonial branch of the naval treasury do not yield a continuous series of figures. Nonetheless, they provide ranges for the size, distribution and changes through time of government expenditure in the colonies, as well as indications of its importance relative to the general level of economic activity, and of the net cost to France of running its North American colonies.</description><creator>Desbarats, Catherine M.

Using chromatographic separation and photoaffinity labelling techniques, LTC$ sb4$ synthase was found to be a unique enzyme distinct from all other known glutathione S-transferases. An 18 kDa membrane polypeptide was specifically labelled in the microsomal membranes of myelocytic cell lines containing LTC$ sb4$ synthase activity (U937 and THP-1), with a photoaffinity derivative of LTC$ sb4$ (azido (I$ sp{125}$) -LTC$ sb4$) and was identified as a candidate for being LTC$ sb4$ synthase or a subunit thereof. LTC$ sb4$ synthase was subsequently purified to homogeneity from THP-1 cells and the purified preparation contained only one polypeptide which had a molecular mass of 18 kDa. By gel filtration chromatography, the native molecular mass of LTC$ sb4$ synthase was determined to be approximately $39 pm3$ kDa. It was therefore concluded that LTC$ sb4$ synthase is enzymatically active as a homodimer. The sequence of the N-terminal 35 amino acids of purified human LTC$ sb4$ synthase was determined and was found to be unique, composed primarily of hydrophobic amino acids and containing a protein kinase C (PKC) consensus sequence. Further analysis of the potential phosphoregulation of LTC$ sb4$ synthase in neutrophilic and eosinophilic HL-60 cells demonstrated that cysteinyl leukotriene biosynthesis, but not non-cysteinyl leukotriene biosynthesis, was specifically attenuated by phorbol ester-mediated activation of PKC. In eosinophilic HL-60 and THP-1 cells this decrease in cysteinyl leukotriene production was demonstrated to be due to non-competitive inhibition of LTC$ sb4$ synthase activity. Concomitant with the PKC-mediated decrease in cysteinyl leukotriene biosynthesis, an increase in prostanoid biosynthesis occurred.

A monokaryotic strain (52J) derived from a Paprican dikaryon (52P) by regenerating mycelium-derived protoplasts had better pulp bleaching ability than its dikaryotic parent. Unusually low extracellular laccase and manganese peroxidase activity levels were associated with reduced pulp bleaching. Mutants of strain 52J were isolated with various manganese peroxidase and laccase activities. Those with markedly reduced laccase and manganese peroxidase activity had impaired abilities to bleach, delignify, and produce methanol from hardwood kraft pulp, mineralize $ sp{14}$C-labelled synthetic lignins, reduce the colour of kraft mill bleach plant effluent, or had lost these abilities altogether. Dechlorination of kraft bleach plant effluent organochlorines was only slightly less in the mutants tried than in 52J. When purified manganese peroxidase was added back to mutant M49 of 52J, significant pulp bleaching was restored. Effluent decolorization also improved with added manganese peroxidase.</description><creator>Addleman, Katherine</creator><contributor>Archibald, Frederick (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Wood-pulp -- Bleaching.</subject><subject>Lignin -- Biodegradation.</subject><subject>Trametes versicolor</subject><title>Biological bleaching of kraft pulps by monokaryotic, dikaryotic, and mutant strains of Trametes versicolor</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z603r003d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nv9354525</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5712m815d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:29:08Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The works of jurist Louis Le Caron (1534-1613) are part of a body of doxological writings by a school of humanists who repudiated Aristotelian scholasticism. In the Dialogues (1556), Le Caron elaborated a theory of poetics as well as a vision of the cosmos and of man encompassing political, aesthetic, ethical and epistemological perspectives. The Dialogues can be regarded as an example of absolute idealism because their philosophical underpinnings echo the neo-Platonic tradition. This being said, the way the book's arguments are organized into dialogues demonstrates an ideological shift which, in the middle of the century, progressively undermined the current monolithic vision rooted in theology. Thus, the structure of the Dialogues reveals a new emphasis on a field of knowledge largely ignored by Platonism: that of transformation and becoming, the object of opinion rather than of rational certainty.</description><creator>Adrien, Marie-Hélène</creator><contributor>Kushner, Eva (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Le Caron, Louis, 1534-1613.

This thesis analyzes in systematic fashion the content and the evolution of their discourse. In addition to engaging in "dialogue" (via their reviews) with certain publishers, the critics reflected upon the problem of regionalism and universalism in Grandbois' "clear and simple" prose works, although in quite different ways with each new book. The collections of poems, on the other hand, because of their "hermetism", induced commentators to study the question of the intelligible and the unintelligible in poetry, a question closely linked to that of the meaning--or the absurdity--of existence. Moreover, these interpreters of Grandbois' works, in order to actualize them, read them into the social discourse of the time. Thus, some denounced them for reasons of dogma or of morality; others, more numerous, sought to make Grandbois' texts more "readable" by referring them to current events or phenomena, such as the Second World War, the immediate post-war period, or the "silent revolution" of the 1960s. Products of the classical education system, Grandbois' exegetes drew their inspiration from the principal tendencies of European criticism. As well, they tended to compare Grandbois' prose works to those of French prose writers of the interwar years, and to link his poetry to that of European poets (the surrealists and those they influenced, among others), although occasional reference was made to local writers. Over time, the critics came to construct the myth of Alain Grandbois, that "exceptional" literary and human being who acclimatized the "modern" poem to Quebec, after having roamed the world from 1925 to 1940. The history of Alain Grandbois' critical good fortune, in short, is that of a happy match between an "eminently" distinguished author and his grateful commentators, for whom he created the opportunity to say "new" things about man, art and life.</description><creator>Fortin, Marcel</creator><contributor>Ricard, Froucois (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Grandbois, Alain, 1900-1975 -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><title>La fortune critique d'Alain Grandbois, 1933-1963</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mg74qn53f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9593tw72r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g158bj73q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:29:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Sequential kinetic resolutions proceed via two or more enantioselective steps. An optimum sequential kinetic resolution has, first, equal specificity for both substrates: starting material and intermediate product. Hence, in the porcine liver esterase (PLE)-catalyzed hydrolysis of trans-1,2-diacetoxycyclohexane rac-1, a significant increase in the enantiomeric purity of the final product was observed when the rates of hydrolysis of 1-diacetate and 1-monoacetate were equalized by using a biphasic system buffer-organic solvent where the fast reacting diacetate was partially extracted to the organic phase. The resulting enantiomeric purity was increased from 58 in buffer to 94% ee in two-phase conditions where both steps are partly rate-determining. The second criterion for an optimal resolution is high enantioselectivity for both steps (E$ sb1$ and E$ sb2$) so that the maximum overall enantioselectivity, E$ sb{ rm T(max)}$, given approximately by (1 + (E$ sb1$ $ times$ E$ sb2)$) /2, is as large as possible. Enantiomers of the following C$ sb2$-symmetric compounds were also separated by sequential resolution: trans-1,2-cyclohexanediol, trans-2,3-butanediol, trans-2,4-pentanediol, trans-2,5-hexanediol and trans-1,2-cyclopentanediol. Finally, high enantiomeric purities were measured with a methodology employing enzymes to concentrate the minor enantiomer.</description><creator>Caron, Gaétan</creator><contributor>Kazlauskas, Ronias J.

A series of underground experiments were undertaken at Copper Cliff North Mine to evaluate the design criteria and performance of several communications infrastructures. The work successfully demonstrated the capability of real-time operation of voice, data and stationary video communication as well as surface-to-underground tele-operation of a load-haul-dump machine. This was achieved with a communications system consisting of a broadband bus linked to leaky feeder coaxial cables by means of distributed antenna translators. The success of the trials permitted a strategy for mine automation to be devised. The economic benefits of mine automation were estimated by means of economic models developed for the mine. Projected benefits, evaluated in terms of mining cost reduction, throughput time and quality improvement, were concluded to be significant. As a result of the analysis, future research and development is concluded to be best targeted at improving ore grade, optimizing process productivity and maximizing machine utilization.</description><creator>Baiden, Gregory Robert</creator><contributor>Scoble, M.

To identify the aberrant gene underlying the defects observed in the Sp mouse mutant we initiated positional cloning strategy. Our preliminary efforts were directed at establishing the boundaries of a deleted chromosomal segment found in the Sp$ sp{r}$ allele, using nine gene probes that were assigned to that region of chromosome 1. Four of these genes, Vil, Des, Inha, and Akp-3, spanning a genetic distance of approximately 15 cM, were found to map within the Sp$ sp{r}$ deletion. In order to further delineate the subchromosomal location of the Sp gene, the proximal segment of mouse chromosome 1 was saturated with microclones isolated from a library of microdissected genomic fragments generated from this region. An additional eight markers were found to map within the confines of the Sp$ sp{r}$ deletion. During the course of this work a member of the paired box gene family, Pax-3, was described as a candidate for Sp. The striking similarity between the tissue distribution of Pax-3 mRNA in normal developing embryos, and the neural structures affected in Sp mice, together with the chromosome 1 location of Pax-3 led us to examine whether Pax-3 was mutated in three alleles at this locus Sp$ sp{r}$, Sp$ sp{2H}$ and Sp. The entire Pax-3 gene was determined to be deleted in the Sp$ sp{r}$ allele. Analysis of genomic DNA and cDNA clones constructed from RNA isolated from $Sp sp{2H}/Sp sp{2H}$ embryos identified a deletion of 32 nucleotides within the paired type homeobox and is predicted to produce a truncated protein as a result of a newly created termination codon at the deletion breakpoint. The original Sp allele was also characterized and found to contain an A to T transversion at position -2 in the third intron of Pax-3 which abrogates the normal splicing of this intron due to the loss of its natural 3$ sp prime$ splice acceptor. Taken together, these studies indicate that the severe defect in neural tube formation detected in Sp and its allelic variants is linked to the inactivation of the paired box gene Pax-3, and provides direct genetic evidence of a key role for Pax-3 in normal neural development.</description><creator>Epstein, Douglas J.</creator><contributor>Trasler, D.

This quality can best be evaluated by a subjective assessment which is often difficult to administer and time consuming. An objective measure which is consistent with subjective assessment could play a vital role in the evaluation as well as in the design of a low bit-rate speech coder. In this dissertation, we introduce two distortion measures for speech coder evaluation. Since the perceptual abilities of a human being determine the precision with which speech data must be processed, we consider the details of cochlear (inner ear) and other auditory processing. Using Lyon's auditory model, the time-domain signal is mapped onto a perceptual-domain (PD). Any speech utterance is communicated to the brain through a series of all-or-none electrical spikes (firings) and the PD representation provides information pertaining to the probability-of-firings in the neural channels. Our first measure, namely the cochlear discrimination information (CDI), evaluates the cross-entropy of the neural firings for the coded speech with respect to those for the original one. With this measure, we also compute the rate-distortion function determining the lowest bit-rate required for a specified amount of distortion. In the second measure, namely the cochlear hidden Markovian (CHM) measure, we attempt to capture the high-level processing in the brain with simple hidden Markov models (HMMs). We characterize the firing events by HMMs where the order of occurrence of PD observations and correlations among adjacent observations are modeled suitably. For computing the coder distortion, the PD observations of the coded speech are matched against the HMMs derived from the PD observations of the original speech. Experimental results show that these measures conform to subjective evaluation results in majority of the cases. Finally, the introduced measures are also app</description><creator>De, Aloknath</creator><contributor>Kabal, Peter (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Auditory distortion measures for speech coder evaluation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3b591987f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2v23vv78s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):31950</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
