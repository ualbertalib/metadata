The lag could not be reduced by supplementation with purines, pyrimidines or ashed trypticase soy broth. Subsequently, it was found that the addition to the medium of various sideramines (iron-transporting growth factors) shortened the lag phase and increased the total cell crop. The sideramine requirement could be replaced by a number of chelating agents. It is postulated that these chelating agents may play a role in iron transport. Sodium chloride (up to 0.1 M) stimulated growth of A. citreus, but the nature of this stimulation has not been investigated. The vitamins and amino acids required for optimal growth of A. citreus at 25° C have been determined to be thiamine, biotin, nicotinic acid, tyrosine, cystine, methionine and glutamic acid.</description><creator>Seidman, Phyllis E.</creator><contributor>Chan, E.

Sand cultures involving the use of twenty-seven different nutrient solutions, including three levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, and their various combinations, were used. Certain of these treatments were selected and subjected to continuous illumination. Yield records of tops, trimmed heads, and roots, based on green weight and oven-dried weight values, were tabulated and analyzed statistically. Observations on development of tipburn were examined. It was shown that increasing the nitrogen concentration produced increases in yield up to a critical level, beyond which a deleterious effect was noted. Over a wide range of concentrations, additional phosphorus gave continued increases in yield. Additional potassium did not have a significantly positive effect on yield. In the tipburn studies, high levels of nutrients encouraged burning. Nitrogen appears to be the most important single element. Practically all the burning took place in darkness. Abnormal respiration is offered as a possible explanation for the physiology of tipburn.</description><creator>Chan, Allan Poy.</creator><contributor>Murray, H.

It occurs in all soils, though usually in low concentrations, and is found in deposits as the ore, pyrolusite. Analyses of plants (25, 33, 37, 39, 40, 44) show that it is absorbed by them and stored in the leaves and in the germ and pericarp of the seeds. That plants absorb manganese has been known since Scheele’s work in 1774, but recently it has been shown that different quantities will be absorbed under changing conditions (17,52); that the amounts absorbed will differ with various stages in the development of the plant (68); and, that the amounts required by different species will vary (36,37). Many workers (1,7,10,13,16,18,20,22,23,24,29,34,35, 37,40,41,42,43,45,54,55,57,58,60,63,75) have shown that manganese in certain concentrations stimulates the growth of higher plants, yeasts, and fungi; that to obtain maximal growth it must not be omitted from the nutrient solution; and that it cannot be replaced by any other element.

Characteristic morphological changes during biotin-sufficient growth are interrupted in biotin-deficient medium, where cells become grossly aberrant. The minimum amount of biotin required for normal growth and morphology was found to be 0.08 - 0.4 mug/ml in a chemically-defined medium. Morphological changes associated with biotin-nutrition were followed by light and electron microscopy. The aberrant form consisted of several protoplasts within a thick matrix, quite unlike the single-celled form of the organism. The matrix may consist of unpolymerized cell wall precursors or components. These protoplasts appeared to develop from division in the absence of normal cell wall synthesis. Both cell types resisted Iysis by osmotic shock but the aberrant forms demonstrated greater resistance to destruction by sonication. This could be attributed to the external matrix which may absorb the shock of ultrasonic treatment.</description><creator>Robertson, Janet A.</creator><contributor>Chan, E.

In wheat the germ is readily distinguished as the small wrinkled portion of the grain on the opposite side of the crease. It makes up about 1.2 percent of the weight of wheat. Structurally, the scutellum is closely associated with the germ, both being separated from the endosperm by a layer of compressed cells, the hyaline layer. The scutellum and embryo together make up about 2.7 percent of the weight of the wheat kernel (27). Bailey (7) reports 2.23 percent in hard wheat. The embryo consists essentially of a plumule and a radicle portion, which become the leaves and roots respectively, of the new plant. Many analyses of wheat germ are to be found in the literature. Frequently, however, the source of the germ is not specified, nor is the degree of contamination with non-germ portions of the wheat indicated. Dissection of the wheat manually would be the ideal method of preparing samples, but this has not generally been undertaken, although Hinton has resorted to this method (27). Germ as produced by ordinary methods of milling contains a certain amount of the scutellum. It is always contaminated with some bran, although this may be reduced to a relatively low figure by careful screening and aspirating.

It was hypothesized that patients with left hemisphere lesions (right hemiplegia and aphasia) would be most deficient in verbal copying and that patients with right hemisphere lesions (left hemiplegia) would be most deficient in non-verbal copying. There were no significant differences between left hemiplegics without aphasia and right hemiplegics with aphasia. The copying of block capital letters was easiest and the less familiar geometric shapes most difficult for both, groups. The results suggest that in a copying task the verbal aspect of a verbal stimulus is reduced or eliminated, and support the findings of certain previous investigators in showing that brain-damaged patients with left- and right-hemisphere les ions did not differ quantitatively in the copying of non-verbal figures.</description><creator>Ridgway, Patricia D.</creator><contributor>Doehring, D.

The properties of an enzyme necessary for the purification of a DNA-RNA hybrid are outlined and the properties of the endonuclease of Neurospora crassa conidia is presented. The purified enzyme degrades single-stranded denatured DNA 50-60 times faster than native DNA and after ageing 6 -8 weeks, the enzyme degrades denatured DNA 200 times faster than native DNA. DNA-RNA hybrid is synthesized using denatured DNA as template and the four nucleoside triphosphates as substrate and then the endonuclease is used to purify the hybrid. Methylated albumin kieselguhr chromatography is used to separate hybrid from degraded DNA. The hybrids were found to be 75% pure. The possibility of using this method for the isolation of specific ribosomal RNA-DNA and- transfer RNA-DNA hybrids is discussed.</description><creator>Rabin, Eli Z.</creator><contributor>Fraser, M.

The immunosuppressant azathioprine, a purine analog, was administered to the rabbits to see if altered immune response in the animals would affect the course of acute glomerulonephritis. Preliminary experiments were carried out to arrive at a suitable dosage of azathioprine. In a further experiment rabbits received both azathioprine and nephrotoxin. In these animals no kidney lesions developed but hypertension still occurred.

Various methyl allyl celluloses containing about 0.5 to 1.5 allyl groups per glucose unit have been prepared from an alkali soluble methylcellulose. Three studied in detail contained 0.70 methyl and 0.79 allyl, or O.59 methyl and 0.95 allyl and 0.59 methyl and 1.47 allyl groups. The solubilities and properties of these substances, together with the acetate and dibromide of the latter, were noted. Methods for estimating the degree of unsaturation of these compounds were worked out including a modified bromide-bromate method. A study of the changes in physical properties of methyl allyl cellulose films, cross-linked by polymerization of the allyl groups, indicated that polymerization, decreased their solubility, flexibility, elongation at break, and moisture vapour permeability, while their tensile strength remained almost constant. Films of the more highly allylated derivative, when polymerized, satisfied the standard test for nitroglycerine barriers.</description><creator>Cox, Lionel Audley.</creator><contributor>Purves, C.

Cependant Mallarmé va beaucoup plus loin, en créant un mythe nouveau. Ce mythe comprend trois thèmes majeurs, correspondant à trois phases importantes dans l'oeuvre de Mallarmé. Le thème de l'histrion, visible depuis la période parnassienne (1862-66), exprime d'abord la crise centrale du mythe: "l'antagonisme de rêve chez l'homme avec les fatalités h son existence départies par le Malheur”. Le thème de l'orphelin, qui correspond à la période d'Igitur (1869), manifeste une volonté de dépassement de cet antagonisme. Le mythe ne pourrait exister sans cet espoir de dépassement. C'est pourquoi, enfin, le thème du théatre, exposé dans divers écritsh partir de 1886, vient suggérer la nécessité de fonder en réalité ce rêve d'Hamlet. Or au terme de cette dernière phase l'antagonisme du Rêve et du Hasard s'avère irréductible; tout espoir est vain, c'est ce que révèle le poème, Un coup de dés, qui annonce ainsi la fin du mythe.</description><creator>Michon, Jacques</creator><contributor>Jones, H.

Changes of many kinds affected the Church of England during this period. Regarding most of them I have nothing to say. I have deliberately restricted myself to changes in thought, and the subtitle of this thesis indicates its scope and purpose. I have said nothing about the organized life of the church, or about its government or liturgy. I have even avoided any mention of the change in the favoured style of preaching, though this is closely related to the thought of the Restoration period. I have not discussed the ways in which the ministry of the church was recruited, nor the question of the social position of its clergy. I have not attempted to assess the influence it exercised, though it is nearly a century since Macaulay pointed out that the pulpit was one of the formative of all forces moulding public opinion. The limitation to changes in thought has consequently been deliberate; only a self-imposed restriction of this kind could keep the study within manageable bounds. At the same time, it is necessary to point out that the thesis is not concerned with the history of religious thought in general, but only with those aspects of it wherein changes can clearly be discerned. Consequently, the relatively static forms of Anglican theology have been ignored. [...]</description><creator>Cragg, Gerald R. (Gerald Robertson)</creator><contributor>Adair, E.

The enzyme is induced in intact but not in adrenalectomized rats by 8-azaguanine administered in the absence of exogenous hormone; this effect appeared to be non-specific, and is probably due to endogenous corticosteroids produced in response to stress.</description><creator>Levitan, Irwin B.</creator><contributor>Webb, T.

Hais le problème ne semble pas susceptible de donner lieu a une théorie générale sur le Droit, et comme cette étude a pris ce point de vue, il est nécessaire de la justifier. L’investigateur qui désire s’approcher d’une question juridique avec le but de connaître la vérité, doit se dépouiller de toutes ses préventions; il commencera par poser ses prémisses, qui ne sont pas autres que celles que tout homme connaît: la société et le Droit. Cela fait, il analysera le Droit, distinguera ses éléments techniques et rationnels, et fixera, parmi les premiers, l’acte juridique. Avec l’acte juridique l’ouvrage se place, déjà, a une grande distance de la position traditionnelle, qui ne parvint jamais à dégager clairement la notion d’acte juridique; elle l’a confondu avec le contrat, rendant impossible une théorie consistante sur les nullités. C’est l’analyse de l’acte qui constitue la seconde étape, car, comment saura-t-on ce qu’est un acte juridique nul si on ignore l’acte juridique valable?

Effects were compared on right and left atria and the main emphasis was put on phenylephrine as a means of identifying α-receptors. Propranolol, a β-adrenergic blocking drug, was found to inhibit the effects of phenylephrine on rate of the rabbit atrium and on contractility of the rabbit right atrium. Propranolol did not inhibit the inotropic effects of phenylephrine on the left atrium. Inotropic effects of phenylephrine on rabbit right and left atrial preparations were inhibited by the α-adrenergic blocking drugs, phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine. It is concluded that the effect of phenylephrine on rate of the rabbit atrium is mediated by β-receptors only. The effect of phenylephrine on contractility of the right atrium is mediated by both β- and α-receptors.

For this purpose, a monkey lung fragment technique was modified to incorporate the use of suspensions of lung tissue for passive sensitization. Serum fractions prepared by DEAE-Sephadex and Sephadex G-200 chromatography of ragweed allergic sera were compared by hemagglutinating, Prausnitz-Kustner (P-K) and in vitro monkey lung suspension techniques. The results demonstrated a close correlation between the results of assays by P-K and in vitro anaphylaxis techniques. No relationship was observed between hemagglutination and either of the biological assay methods.

Cette étude a été provoquée d’abord par un cours de stylistique qui attire l’attention sur la vie mouvante et changeante des langues modernes. On trouve intéressantes les différences de valeur de deux “synonymes” dans deux langues modernes, les expressions qui se disent dans une langue et pas dans une autre, les termes archaïques d’une langue qui sont usuels dans une autre -- tout cela pose la question de la connaissance de la langue étrangère que les traducteurs américains doivent posséder pour leur travail.

Part of the work discussed in the is study was to investigate this problem and to show whether or not the biological activity associated with rat brain tissue is due solely to acetylcholine. It was suggested that acetyl-I-carnitylcholine could play a role in nerve metalolism. The cholinergic potency of synthetic acetyl-I-carnitylcholine was measured on the guinea pig ileum preparation and it was found to be one half as active as acetyl choline when determined by two procedures (i) “one-point" assay (ii) "multipoint" assay. Moreover, the index of discrimination for acetyl-I-carnitylcholine was unity on the guinea pig ileum and frog rectus preparations (muscarinic and nicotinic respectively). The "multipoint" assay was used to determine the effects of mixtures of acetylcholine and acetyl-I-carnitylcholine on a biological assay and it was concluded that potentiation of the acetylcholine activity occurred when these two substances were combined.</description><creator>Kato, Ann C.</creator><contributor>Hosein, E.

Cellulose, especially when associated with lignin, makes up the bulk of the common feedstuffs supplied to cattle in the form of hay, straw and grain. None of the mammals is known, however, to produce an enzyme that will change cellulose and lignin into soluble compounds, but among the microbial associates of many animals are found, in some parts of the digestive tract, forms that can produce enzymes that attack these substances and prepare them for absorption through the blood stream. The close relationship existing between ruminant digestion and bacterial activity gives a strong indication that the nutrition of the ruminant animal is vitally linked with various products derived from bacterial metabolism. [...]The questions of prime interest [...]: 1. What are the agents responsible for the cellulose decomposition in the rumen? 2. What is their mode of action? 3. What are the end-products derived from their action? 4. Of what use to the ruminant animal is the cellulose attacked by the bacteria of the rumen? It is only with the elucidation of these problems that advances will be made in the field of ruminant nutrition and in the full appreciation of the important role played by the microflora of the rumen.</description><creator>Dussault, Henri Paul.</creator><contributor>Gray, P.

The results have been compared with those obtained using frozen tissue sections, and advantages and disadvantages of the methods discussed. Enzymes investigated were, adenosine triphosphatase, succinic and lactic dehydrogenase, acid phosphatase and the cholinesterases. Because of the question of false localization, particularly at the node of Ranvier, two different histochemical methods were used (and compared) for acid phosphatase and adenosine triphosphatase, and some new observations of enzyme, activity in this area have been discussed. It has been concluded that the microdissection method is a particularly useful technique for peripheral nerve enzyme histochemistry, and some further possible applications of the method have been suggested.</description><creator>Kalyanaraman, Uma P.</creator><contributor>Blennerhassett, J.

Sixty full term Wistar rats spontaneously delivered from 12 mothers were used, forty were given intraperitoneal injections of either 5% or 20% glucose at birth and at 2 hourly intervals up to 12 hours; the remaining animals served as controls. They were killed in groups at birth or at 6 to 12 hours postnatally. Liver tissue was obtained for electron microscopy and for chemical determinations of glycogen. In untreated controls the enormous hepatic glycogen store present at birth were almost totally mobilized by 12 hours. In treated rats the glycogen stores persisted and appeared undisturbed electron microscopically. The large increase in endoplasmic reticulum and in Golgi zones seen in controls was not observed in treated rats. Cytolysome formation was delayed. The hepatic fine structure of glucose treated rats at 6 and 12 hours was almost identical to that seen in normal rats at birth. Glucose administration results not only in the persistence of large hepatic glycogen stores but delays the normal developmental changes in the endoplasmic reticulum and other organelles as well.</description><creator>Ho, Joana C.</creator><contributor>Phillips, M.

A sociometric test was given to 40 boys and 49 girls, who comprised three multiracial groups - Cubs and Brownies. This test was designed to show the degree of social interaction among racial subgroups. Results showed that the boys’ group tended toward racial self-preference; whereas, the girls' choices were fairly well distributed, although most were directed to the most prestigious subgroup. The mothers of these children (N=68) were also interviewed to elicit their views on Trinidadian race relations. Three major findings emerged: (1) the urban situation has tended to erase the acute rivalry among racial groups which may still exist in the rural areas; (2) politics in recent years have increased the rift between the East Indians and the Negroes, and between the Whites and the Negroes; (3) within all the racial categories, social class is a more important variable than racial origin in influencing interpersonal interaction.</description><creator>Garstang, Patricia M.</creator><contributor>Henry, F.
