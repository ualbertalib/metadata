In a world with increasing competition for capital, it is mandatory for countries to develop different mechanisms to attract FDI. Mexico is an example of a developing country that in recent years has greatly benefited from FDI. This trend results from this country's development of a number of mechanisms on both the domestic and the international scene promoting this type of investment. Along with the investment openings being fostered on the domestic scene, Mexico has been conducting international efforts to reach FDI objectives. It has entered into a number of Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) as well as Bilateral and Regional Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). The most important goals achieved by this country encouraging the reception of FDI are the preferential trade agreements signed with the two biggest markets in the world, North America and the European Union. Mexico's participation in the WTO represents one of its efforts to establish lateral ties to achieve its FDI objectives. The fact that there is a relationship between trade and investment has been established.</description><creator>Cortés, Martha.</creator><contributor>de Mestral, Armand L. C.

However, during that same period, the world has witnessed a rapid degradation of the environment and an excessive exploitation of natural resources. The urgency of the situation requires the reconciliation of trade liberalization and environmental protection goals. In this context, on January 1, 1994, the North American Free Trade Agreement entered into between Canada, Mexico and the United States came into force. This agreement has significant environmental content and includes a side agreement on environmental matters. This new framework of environmental protection is serving to reconcile trade and environmental goals in the region, and is shaping the new legal framework for environmental protection and enforcement in Mexico.</description><creator>De Icaza Aneiros, Carlos.</creator><contributor>de Mestral, Armand L.

If this Protocol answers the problem of GMOs, by enforcing the application of the precautionary principle to the international trade of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), it does not solve the conflict between the interests of trade and those of the environment. On the contrary, the Biosafety Protocol conflicts with the rules of the GATT and the national norms inspired by it would risk being contested before the dispute-settlement institutions of the World Trade Organisation. The Protocol therefore constitutes a new element in the conflict, pre-existing and unsolved, which sets the implicit supremacy of the GATT against the international environmental norms. It confirms the necessity to find a solution enabling the equal authority and mutual respect of the international environmental and trade rules.

Will we soon be speaking yet again of a national literature? Will we possess as much breadth of literature as do ethnic groups? These are some of the questions asked by one of the protagonists of Monique LaRue in L'arpenteur et le navigateur, a work which has provoked an outcry from the literary community. Quebec literature, like Quebec society, has reached a crossroads; it is now in the process of redefining itself. Is Marco Micone, an immigrant of Italian origin, considered a Quebec author? In this paper, we will attempt to answer that question by delving into his fiction, by examining his contemplative essays and by evaluating his position within the mainstream. We will also observe the way in which the concept of a culture immigree (transplanted culture), expounded by Micone, played a major role in the issue of ecritures migrantes (ethnic writing).</description><creator>Pelletier, Ketra.</creator><contributor>Lamonde, Yvan (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Micone, Marco -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><subject>French-Canadian literature -- Québec (Province) -- History and criticism.</subject><title>Marco Micone : ecrivain quebecois</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m900nw46h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tq57ns828</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kw52j978p</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:55:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Since the late 1980s an increasing amount of literature has attempted to explain liberalization and democratization, or lack thereof, in the Arab world. Theories have developed around such concepts as civil society, state formation and political culture, yet a conclusive theory that could predict the future of these two processes in the Arab world has not emerged. This thesis seeks to add to this body of work by theorizing that regime type---specifically monarchical regimes---may be a useful variable in analyzing political reform in the region and will attempt to explain how and under what conditions some countries will open their political systems. This thesis takes the view that while there has been some indication of liberalization in the Arab world there has been very little evidence of democratization. Evidence of liberalization in Arab monarchies will be shown in case studies of Kuwait and Jordan.</description><creator>Muncaster, Sebastien.</creator><contributor>Brynen, Rex (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Kuwait -- Politics and government.</subject><subject>Jordan -- Politics and government.</subject><subject>Monarchy -- Kuwait.</subject><subject>Monarchy -- Jordan.</subject><title>Liberalization in monarchical regimes : the cases of Jordan and Kuwait</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xd07gv48g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kw52j978p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fx719p06h</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:55:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Internet has emerged as a prominent medium of communication. Today, it has become the focus of enormous debate and evaluation. The objective of this study is to examine the evolution of its impact on society. In this regard, various interpretations of its societal impact are provided. First, the debate on the information society exhibits the widespread belief that society is transforming and a new type of society is emerging. Second, a chronological description of the evolution and development of the Internet displays its burgeoning growth and current utility and capacities. Third, optimistic and pessimistic perspectives elucidate opposite views of the potential it can have on society and humankind. Lastly, a synchronic analysis of media coverage, using The Globe and Mail as an illustration, demonstrates the present reporting of its impact. These various interpretations provide an understanding of the Internet's increasing significance and position within society.</description><creator>Murthy, Jaya D.</creator><contributor>Pericard, Alain (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Internet -- Social aspects.</subject><title>Evolution of the Internet and its impact on society</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20sv620.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fx719p06h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zg64tn81c</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:55:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This paper explores the practical teachings found in the Dunhuang manuscript of the Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch and considers the possibility of practice within a doctrine of sudden enlightenment. Part One outlines how the doctrine of sudden enlightenment can be understood to undermine the purpose for practicing meditation. Part Two first makes a case for the position that practice is presupposed by the text regardless of the doctrine of sudden enlightenment. Next the paper argues for what type of meditation practice the Platform Sutra teaches is consistent with sudden enlightenment. The practice the Platform Sutra teaches is an intentionless, continuous, non-passive non-attachment while in the midst of dharmas that takes as its basis the suchness of things inherent in sentient beings.</description><creator>Myers, Steven W., 1966-</creator><contributor>Hori, G.

The feminine characters in Langevin's novels are shown as strangers: obviously different from men, women are struck by passions that are unknown and incomprehensible to the male heros or to any other man of her environment. In the first part, this study will demonstrate that the majority of heroines lived a painful chidhood with an absent father and an unkind mother. The second part will look at the love relationships of the female protagonists, unions that remain disappointing and are doomed to failure. Finally, the conclusion will examine the tragic death of several heroines (suicide, death in child-birth...). This study of Andre Langevin's feminine characters relies on the feminist critic, using, among others, the work of Barbara Godard and Lori Saint-Martin. This model will offer an innovative perspective of a literary work that has been greatly studied, but for which one important aspect appears to have been neglected: women who inhabit it.</description><description>Andre Langevin's novels, Evade de la nuit (1951), Poussiere sur la ville (1953), Le temps des hommes (1956), L'elan d'Amerique (1972) and Une chaine daps le parc (1974) show numerous lonely characters. Abandoned, secluded or uncivilized, they remain unable to communicate with others: "C'est ce rapport difficile et jamais termine de l'individu avec "autrui" qui constitue la trame essentielle et la continuite de l'oeuvre romanesque d'Andre Langevin", wrote Jean-Louis Major in 1977, in an article about the author.</description><creator>Gratton, Marie-Helene.</creator><contributor>Boucher, Jean-Pierre (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Langevin, André, 1927- -- Characters -- Women.</subject><subject>Women in literature.</subject><title>La femme dans l'oeuvre romanesque d'Andre Langevin /</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h989r5001.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/47429c10c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:08612q51g</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:55:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this study was to assess body-image attitudes and the extent of obligatory exercise among physically active women, and to examine interrelationships among these variables, and age differences. The sample included one hundred and eighty-three female exercise participants, aged 18 to 71 years. The Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire was used to assess subjective body-image attitudes. The Obligatory Exercise Questionnaire was used to assess extent of obligatory exercise behavior. It was found that the majority of physically active women are generally satisfied with most aspects of their body images. However, 82% were concerned with their appearance, 30.6% were preoccupied with their weight, and 41% perceived themselves as being overweight. Appearance evaluation was positively related to satisfaction with weight, which was the strongest predictor of global appearance evaluation. Older women (56 to 71 years) were significantly more concerned with their health than were younger women (18 to 25 years). The extent of obligatory exercise behavior among physically active women was very small, and was not related to age. Obligatory exercise scores were predicted by fitness and health orientation, and overweight preoccupation, and inversely predicted by age and health evaluation.</description><creator>Freitag-Honsberger, Susan.</creator><contributor>Neil, Graham (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Exercise for women.</subject><subject>Body image in women.</subject><subject>Compulsive behavior.</subject><title>The relationship between body image and obligatory exercise behavior among physically active women of various ages /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g158bk037.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/08612q51g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physical Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:c534fq757</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:55:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Attachment theories emphasize the importance of a secure attachment at all stages in life. In secure attachment relationships, individuals are confident that during times of real or perceived distress they can rely on the attachment figure to provide desired security. Conversely, individuals with insecure attachments feel they cannot rely on their attachment figures and thus will not be comforted in times of need. Lack of secure attachments can lead to psychological and behavioral difficulties. In the present study, maternal and peer attachments were investigated and related to levels of self-reported delinquency among 84 First Nations adolescent students, ages 11 to 17 from a reserve in a remote geographic location. The results from the present study appear to be congruent with the literature which reports that insecure attachments in youths lead to higher rates of delinquent behaviors. High levels of secure attachments in the participants resulted in low levels of reported delinquency, however the relationship between attachment and delinquency in adolescent participants was found to be dependent on the grade in school and gender interaction.</description><creator>Grobe, Patricia.</creator><contributor>Burack, Jake (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Adolescent psychology.</subject><subject>Indians of North America -- Québec (Province)</subject><subject>Attachment behavior.</subject><subject>Juvenile delinquency.</subject><subject>Teenagers -- Social networks.</subject><title>Attachment and delinquency among First Nations adolescents from a remote geographic location</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/37720f75b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fq757</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1j92g9271</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:55:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>China's scientific development has gone through several phases over the past 50 years. In 1956, the first generation of leaders called on the whole country to "march towards science," drafting China's first scientific development plan. In 1978, the then Chinese leaders sponsored a national science conference and mapped out scientific development strategies for a new period of reform and opening-up policies. In 1985, the central government issued a "Decision on the Reform of Scientific and Technological Systems," with the aim of accelerating the application of technological discoveries to promote productivity. Since then, China has implemented a series of projects to spur the take-off of the rural economy. In 1995, at a national conference on science and technology, the Chinese leaders put forward the strategy of "revitalizing the country through science, technology and education." The central government listed this strategy along with the policy of sustainable development as the basic principles for China's long-term economic and social development.

It also gives an overview of the history of child marriage from ancient to modern times. The focus of this research is the status of child marriage in the modern Muslim world as a continuation of ancient tradition and the role historical interpretations of Islamic law play in its perpetuation. Child marriage was once a globally accepted and practiced phenomenon. Over the centuries its practice has diminished considerably. Today, although child marriage is viewed as an offensive act and discouraged by the majority of governments around the world, it continues to exist to a significant extent in most parts of the Muslim world. Those Muslim communities which persist in condoning and practicing child marriage are not only affected by cultural traditions but also by their form of understanding of Islamic law. This particular understanding is mostly informed by local religious leaders within their communities who base their justifications on medieval perspectives and interpretations of what constitutes divine law. It is no coincidence, however, that child marriage is restricted to the impoverished, uneducated and rural sectors of society; people who have little choice in deciding their futures and due to harsh and straitened circumstances find it difficult to see any other alternatives.</description><creator>Ali, Anjum Ashraf.</creator><contributor>Hallaq, Wael (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Child marriage.</subject><subject>Marriage (Islamic law)</subject><title>Child marriage in Islamic law</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4j03d1793.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jm214q978</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Islamic Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1z40kv67v</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:55:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Ten trained male track athletes (VO2max = 64.7 ml·kg·min -1) performed three workouts (conditions) with repeated 400-m runs.

Condition 2 was 4 x 400-m runs with the first three reps performed 4 s slower than condition 1 and the 4 th rep was all-out. Condition 3 consisted of 8 x 400-m runs with the first seven reps performed 8 s slower than condition 1 and the 8th rep was all-out. Dependent variables were HR, blood lactate and run time for the final rep in each condition. Peak HRs for the last run were 201, 194, 189 beats·min-1 for conditions 1, 2 &amp; 3 respectively, and were not significantly different. Blood lactate values measured 4 min after the last run were 16.6, 17.8 and 17.1 mmol·L -1 in conditions 1, 2 and 3 respectively, and were not significantly different.

One linear and four LCB mPEs were studied in shear creep and recovery measurements. All the mPEs have similar molecular weight and molecular weight distribution but different levels of long chain branching. A technique was developed to eliminate the effect of non-ideal start-up at the beginning of creep experiment and the small residual stress that exists during the creep recovery period. It is found that the existence of long chain branching is responsible for the increasing of the zero shear viscosity, the steady state compliance and the longest relaxation time. The retardation and relaxation spectrums were calculated from the creep compliance. The dynamic compliance calculated using retardation spectrum is compared with that measured directly. Both are in very good agreement. These observations are compared with the molecular dynamics theory.</description><creator>Ye, Yufeng, 1971-</creator><contributor>Wood-Adams, Paula (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Plastics Technology.</subject><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>The study of long time relaxation behavior of metallocene polyethylene /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bn9998532.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9593tx00q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2b88qd896</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:55:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis analyzes the production of conspiracy theories and paranoia within the realm of Internet newsmaking. Since the end of the Cold War, our traditional enemies have disappeared, and popular culture has embraced the conspiracy theory as their replacement. On the Internet, conspiracy theories are born, evolve and copied in a way unmatched by traditional forms of media. What makes the Internet such a successful conduit for paranoia-inspired narratives? In order to answer this question, I will examine the historical and technological facets of old and new media; how conspiracy theories disseminate through memetic behaviour and simulacra; and whether the media's recent obsession with paranoia is due to the Internet's commodification. The thesis will conclude by addressing whether our perception of the news has changed in the Internet age, and if conspiracy theories offer the possibility of narrative closure in a medium built on non-linear structure.</description><creator>Balfour, Joya.</creator><contributor>Kaite, Berkeley (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Paranoia.</subject><subject>Conspiracies.</subject><subject>Internet.</subject><title>The (dis) information highway : conspiracy theories on the Internet</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5t34sm31c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2b88qd896</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wd375z22p</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:55:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>More than one billion pounds of plasticizers are produced each year to supply the plastics industry. Some of these plasticizers, particularly phthalates, are suspected endocrine disruptors. However, few studies have been conducted to determine if they are susceptible to biodegradation by naturally occurring bacteria once they are released into the environment. Six organisms were tested for their ability to grow in the presence of six different industrial plasticizers. Two bacteria, Rhodococcus rhodochrous and Arthrobacter paraffineus, grew well in media containing n-hexadecane and one of the plasticizers. Fermentations in a 2-liter reactor were performed with Rhodococcus rhodochrous and three plasticizers: bis 2-ethylhexyl adipate, dioctyl phthalate and dioctyl terephthalate. The organism degraded all of the adipate, half of the terephthalate was degraded and the phthalate was degraded slightly. In these growth studies, the toxicity of the media increased as the organism grew. This trend was linked to the accumulation of metabolites from the partial degradation of the plasticizer. The two major metabolites were identified as 2-ethyl hexanol and 2-ethyl hexanoic acid. The alcohol was only observed part way through the growth in the presence of the adipate. Its concentration decreased as it was oxidized to the acid and it was not present at the end of the fermentation. The acid was observed for all three types of plasticizers and it was present in high concentrations at the end of every experiment. The nature and pattern of production of the metabolites were consistent with a pathway for the degradation of all three plasticizers by hydrolysis of the ester bonds. The accumulation of toxic metabolites indicates that biodegradation may not be a solution to reducing environmental impacts associated with plasticizers that have leached into the environment.</description><creator>Nalli, Sandro.</creator><contributor>Cooper, D.

A proposed explanation for the behavior is static strain aging (SSA) and dynamic strain aging (DSA), respectively, caused by the presence of substitutional elements. Much of the previous work on this topic has been focused on the effects of interstitials, namely carbon and nitrogen, at lower temperatures (100--300ºC, depending on the strain rate). However, for substitutional elements to have the same effect, the temperature range must be significantly higher. To further investigate the likelihood that SSA and DSA are caused by substitutional elements, the domain (i.e. temperature and strain rate range) within which yield drops and serrated yielding are observed was studied. The results of this investigation showed that the appearance of SSA is dependent upon the pass strain, interpass time and strain rate, whereas the presence of DSA serrations was strongly dependent upon strain rate. The disappearance of yield drops involves interpass times in excess of one second. This is hypothesized to result from the disappearance of the deformation vacancies and of the associated non-equilibrium segregation. The impurity element phosphorus was isolated as the most probable cause of the observed phenomenon. This is a result of its high diffusivity, combined with its high binding energy.</description><creator>Lobo, David.</creator><contributor>Jonas, John J.

Thermal analysis of sixteen polyethylene and polypropylene resins was carried out, using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) to study the crystallization kinetics and mechanism of crystallization. Attention is given to different polyethylene grades, particularly linear low-density polyethylenes (LLDPE) manufactured with Ziegler-Natta and metallocene catalysts. The polymers are obtained with different monomers (1-butene, 1-hexene or 1-octene). Some polymers are based on gas phase polymerization, while others are based on solution polymerization. The isothermal crystallization data were treated to account for transients and to compensate for instrument errors. The data were fitted to the Avrami and Tobin equations, and the corresponding kinetic parameters are reported. The non-isothermal data were fitted to the Ziabicki equation, in order to determine the relevant parameters. Subsequently, the non-isothermal data were compared to the predictions of the Nakamura equation, with good agreement. An effort was made to compare the isothermal and non-isothermal crystallization behavior of the various resins to evaluate the effect of co-monomer and catalyst type. The results indicate significant differences among the resins, and reveal the utility of the DSC as a tool for distinguishing the characteristics of the various resins.</description><creator>Lungu, Cristian, 1968-</creator><contributor>Kamal, M.

The chemical kinetics model is based on a three-step chain-branching reaction consists sequentially of a chain-initiation and a chain-branching step, followed by a temperature independent chain-termination. The steady ZND structure using the 3-step chemical kinetics model is compared with that based on the standard single-step Arrhenius rate model. An unsteady computation has also been performed to determine whether the solution from steady-state analysis can be approached asymptotically from a transient development. The three regimes of direct initiation have been numerically simulated for planar, cylindrical and spherical geometries using the present 3-step chemical kinetics model. The use of a more realistic reaction scheme allows a unique value for the critical initiation energy to be defined. Some general theories for direct initiation have been verified from the results of the present numerical simulation using a more detailed chemical kinetics model, where a definitive value of the critical energy was obtained.

The increased integration of the modern System On a Chip has necessitated the development of these alternate test strategies to address the issue of device node access and signal integrity. The process of extracting a signal in an analog form across a chip boundary can often compromise its true nature, as these new systems stretch performance limits. The aim of this thesis is to introduce two circuits for on-chip sub-nanosecond signal capture. The emphasis is placed on providing gigahertz rate effective sampling resolutions to provide a progressive characterization solution for the ever increasing operating speed of integrated circuits. The first circuit presented is a hardware implementation of an undersampling algorithm that extends the operation of a pre-existing mixed-signal test-core to the capture of periodic signals with a bandwidth much greater than the sample rate of the system. This hardware unit comprises of a specialized timing module based on a Delay Locked Loop with tap selection circuitry. The effective sampling resolution of the system is limited by the intrinsic gate delay of the technology the timing module is implemented in. The second circuit presented is a specialized jitter measurement device. This device is based on a Vernier Delay Line Time-to-Digital converter, and can provide resolutions well below a gate delay. Special emphasis was given to jitter measurement, since it is an issue that is often difficult to address adequately in the testing of many complex circuits. Both the aforementioned circuits were implemented in a 0.35 mum CMOS process, and results demonstrating their successful operation are presented.</description><creator>Abaskharoun, Nazmy.</creator><contributor>Roberts, Gordon W.

This thesis will cover the design and implementation of three monolithic reconstruction filters. The first is an audio band active-RC Butterworth filter which is realized using a leapfrog structure. The various issues related to this design are dealt with including design-for-testability circuitry and tuning circuitry. The next two filters are both implementations of a current steering semidigital FIR reconstruction filters. These implementations are meant to reveal an alternative approach to designing reconstruction filters which is simpler, consumes less silicon space and is more power efficient than the conventional analog filter approaches and the other semdigital FIR approaches. Furthermore, as will be shown in the second of the two semidigital filters, it offers the option of programmability with the addition of a minimal amount of unobtrusive digital circuitry. The functionality of the design-far-testability circuitry incorporated in the active-RC filter will be validated experimentally. In addition, the current steering semidigital approach to designing reconstruction filters will be validated and the various pros and cons of such an approach will be examined.</description><creator>Aga, Arshan.</creator><contributor>Roberts, Gordon W.

Electrophysiological techniques have been designed to estimate this number but, despite considerable effort, they only provide an approximation of the exact number. To assist further development in this field, the specific problem of the classification of stimulus-evoked potentials was investigated. Over 1300 series of signals were recorded from four subjects over a five-week period. From these data sets, those having clearly separable unique responses were selected and unsupervised learning methods were employed to identify the different response classes. The lowest misclassification error rate obtained under these conditions was 25%. A subsequent evaluation of an interactive graph-theoretic clustering technique presented interesting results with an error rate of 8%. The findings hold promise for developing better methods to estimate the number of motor units.</description><creator>Anctil, Benoit.</creator><contributor>Slawnych, Michael (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</subject><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Signal classification issues in motor unit number estimation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4x51hm05b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r207tr155</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biomedical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cf95jd14g</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:55:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis explores the notion of whether or not race is a determining factor in how African-Canadians perceive their subjective well-being. To this end, this study seeks to understand Blacks perception of what constitutes their identity and how they resist against minority consciousness. Also examined are their integration aspirations and the set of strategies they use to claim mobility status in mainstream North American society. The areas explored reflect interviewees' perceptions of the social factors that determine how they view their well-being. The data for this inquiry is gathered from in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. Data from focus groups, are discussions that I facilitated while working on the Montreal Black Communities Demographic Project. Empirical research is used to support the data at specific points. Analysis of the data does not support the view that Blacks perceive their well-being as dependent on their status as racialized subjects. Research findings do however show that the social determinant of race has an impact on the strategies Blacks choose to obtain socio-economic status.</description><creator>Wint, Shirlette.</creator><contributor>Leonard, Peter (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Davies, Linda (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Blacks -- Canada.</subject><subject>Happiness.</subject><subject>Blacks -- Race identity.</subject><title>Race and the subjective well-being of black Canadians</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k3569629w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cf95jd14g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nz806172w</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:55:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Recognising that NPT2 is the major Na/Pi cotransporter in the kidney, that hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH) is caused by a renal Pi leak and, that Npt2 knockout mice demonstrate a biochemical phenotype similar to that of patients with HHRH, we sought to determine whether NPT2 was a candidate gene for this disorder. Using single-strand conformation polymorphsim (SSCP) analysis and sequencing in six unrelated pedigrees with the disease, we found no disease-causing mutations. Two polymorphisms were identified in the gene and used as markers to examine segregation of NPT2 with the disease. HHRH did not segregate with the gene markers. In addition, the impact of NPT2 on bone mineral density (BMD) was examined by genotyping a population of 104 individuals for which BMD data was available, and determining whether there was an association between NPT2 genotype and bone density.

We assessed this association using a population-based approach. Utilizing the Saskatchewan Health databases, we conducted a case-control study nested within a cohort of 3639 patients with diabetes, newly prescribed angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) or dispensed other anti-hypertensive drugs during 1982 to 1987. There were 162 cases of hypoglycemia identified. All potential controls, matched to the case on entry date and at different eligible at-risk times, were selected (n = 8329). After adjustment for confounders, current users of ACE-I and non-selective beta-blockers had a clinically important increased risk of hypoglycemia, RR 1.61 (95% CI: 0.99--2.60) and RR 1.81 (0.97--3.40), respectively. Current users of ACE-I for a duration of 120 days or greater had a 2-fold increased hypoglycemic risk, RR 2.06 (1.12--3.82).
