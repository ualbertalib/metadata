The critique section of this thesis describes how the irony of a marginalised character can yield an identity statement. This essay studies how Quebec realities are echoed in an ironic manner by the narrator, illustrating her cultural identity within Quebec society yet all the while affirming her complex subjectivity. The observation of the ironic mechanisms will allow for a better understanding of the exploited strategies depicted in the creative writing section of this thesis, the novel Y'a pus d'eau dans piscine . The character portrayed in this novella is unsatisfied with traditional identity categories and makes use of irony and digression to create new identity configurations. Those strategies then allow this character to gain perspective on the consequences of her gender hybridization.</description><creator>Caron, Geneviève.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Other (Philosophy) in literature.</subject><subject>Balzano, Flora, 1951- -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><title>Écho ironique et altérité chez Flora Balzano : l'autre est un je, suivi de, Y'a pus d'eau dans piscine (récit)</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c821gp69r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gh93h328r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2n49t5872</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:20:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is comprised of a literature review on the topic of social participation in the elderly, and a study examining the association between primary transportation mode used and social participation in community-dwelling seniors. A review of the literature showed that social participation in the elderly is associated with survival, health-related quality of life, functional ability, emotional well-being, and cognitive skills, and is also influenced by personal and environmental factors. The study indicated that primary mode of transportation used by seniors living in the community is associated with social participation; those driving, walking or using public transport had overall greater social participation than passengers and those using adapted transport/taxi. These findings are of interest to rehabilitation professionals and researchers working in gerontology, as well as to policy makers, since facilitating the use of readily available transportation modes is primordial to maintaining social participation of seniors living in the community.</description><creator>Dahan-Oliel, Noémi, 1977-</creator><date>2009</date><subject>Transportation.</subject><subject>Aged.</subject><subject>Social Behavior.</subject><subject>Aged, 80 and over.</subject><title>Transportation and social participation in community-dwelling elderly = Les moyens de transport et la participation sociale chez les aînés habitant dans la communauté</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ff365878w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2n49t5872</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Physical and Occupational Therapy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fx719q78z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:20:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study investigated the neural correlates of memory for human nonlinguistic emotional vocalizations as a function of individual differences in trait anxiety and depression. 20 healthy subjects (female; aged 18-30) free from neurological impairments or psychiatric illness underwent MRI scanning to obtain T1 structural images of their brain, and participated in a subsequent behavioral memory task outside the scanner. Volumetry of the hippocampus and amygdala was performed using a validated protocol. We found emotional vocalizations were better remembered than neutral ones, with performance for negative better than positive. Memory performance for emotional items was associated with hippocampal volume, with no association between memory and I amygdala volume detected. Differences in anxiety or depression had no influence on memory or volume.

OSA may lead to poor growth, developmental delay, behaviour or learning problems. Recent evidence also suggests that children with OSA may develop cardiovascular complications, the mechanisms perhaps involving hypoxemia, the autonomic nervous system, apneas, and arousals. Surgical removal of tonsils and adenoids (adenotonsillectomy (T&amp;A)) usually cures pediatric OSA. To diagnose OSA at all levels of severity, polysomnography is currently the best approach. The McGill Oximetry Score (MOS) is a validated measure based on nocturnal pulse oximetry. An abnormal MOS has a 97% positive predictive value at detecting moderate-severe OSA. Because the MOS was devised by measuring frequency of desaturations (&lt;90%) and numbers of clusters of desaturations, it is not accurate at detecting OSA in children who do not have such drops in oxygen saturation. Accordingly, other measures applicable to a wider spectrum of children should be assessed. These measures should be simpler, less cumbersome, cheaper, and more accessible than polysomnography. OBJECTIVES: To study alternative approaches that may be used to identify moderate-severe OSA in children, two studies were conducted. We examined one subjective measure - the OSA-18 parent questionnaire - and two objective measures - pulse rate and pulse rate variability. For the OSA-18 study, the goal was to determine whether it would accurately detect children with moderate-severe OSA as indicated by an abnormal MOS. For the pulse rate and pulse rate variability study, the goal was to determine if either or both would decrease after treatment with T&amp;A for children with moderate-severe OSA. METHODS: For the OSA-18 study, we used a cross-sectional design that included children 1-18 years old referred to a pediatric sleep laboratory for evaluation of suspected OSA. Alongside data from the OSA-18, we analyzed demographic and medical data (from a parent questionnaire) and information regarding adenotonsillar hypertrophy. We estimated sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values as well as receiver operating curves of the OSA-18 in detecting an abnormal MOS. We also conducted univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, using the MOS as the dependent variable and the OSA-18 score and others (age, gender, comorbidities, race) as independent variables. For the second study, we used a retrospective before-after design to compare pulse rate and pulse rate variability as measured by nocturnal pulse oximetry pre- and post-T&amp;A of otherwise healthy children 1-18 years old with moderate-to-severe OSA. RESULTS: For the OSA-18 study, we studied 334 children (58% male, mean age 4.6 +/- 2.2 years). The OSA-18 had a sensitivity of 40% and a negative predictive value of 73% for detecting an abnormal MOS. In addition, the area under the receiver operating curve was 0.611. While controlling for other independent variables in the logistic regression model, for each unit increase in the OSA-18 Score, the odds of having an abnormal MOS were increased by 2%. However, for each increase in age of 1 year, the odds of having an abnormal MOS were decreased by 17%. In the pulse rate and pulse rate variability study, 25 subjects (88% male; mean age 4.3 +/- 3.6 years) were enrolled. Following T&amp;A, pulse rate and pulse rate variability decreased in 21 of 25 and 23 of 25 children, respectively. Mean pulse rate dropped from 99.7+/-11.2 to 90.1+/-10.7 bpm, p&lt;0.001; age-standardized pulse rate (z-score) from 0.8 (0.4, 1.5) to 0.4 (0, 0.9), p=0.04). Pulse rate variability, as measured by the standard deviation of the pulse rate decreased from 10.3 +/- 2.1 to 8.2 +/- 1.6 bpm, p&lt;0.001. As well, OSA symptomatology, parental concern about breathing during sleep and the MOS all improved. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the first study we conclude that among children referred to a sleep laboratory, the OSA-18 does not accurately detect which children will have an abnormal MOS. The OSA-18 should not be used in place of objective testing to identify moderate-severe OSA in children. However, from the second study we conclude that measures of the autonomic nervous system such as pulse rate and pulse rate variability, as measured by pulse oximetry, decreased following surgical treatment of moderate-severe OSA. The results of this study potentially serve as important data for further work that would determine the accuracy of pulse rate and pulse rate variability measures and their diagnostic usefulness for OSA at all levels of severity.</description><creator>Constantin, Evelyn.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Child.</subject><subject>Heart Rate.</subject><subject>Child, Preschool.</subject><subject>Questionnaires.</subject><subject>Sleep Apnea, Obstructive -- diagnosis.</subject><subject>Quality of Life.</subject><subject>Oximetry -- methods.</subject><title>Evaluation of measures used for diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in children</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m326m5485.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ws859k380</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xp68kk862</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:20:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study was designed to clarify some of the issues surrounding the nature of hemispheric contributions to the processing of emotional and linguistic prosody, as well as to examine the relative contribution of different sensory modalities in processing prosodic structures. Ten healthy young participants were presented with semantically neutral sentences expressing affective or linguistic prosody solely through the use of non-verbal cues (intonation, facial expressions) while undergoing tMRI. The sentences were presented under auditory, visual, as well as audio-visual conditions. The emotional prosody task required participants to identify the emotion of the utterance (happy or angry) and the linguistic prosody task required participants to identify the type of utterance (question or statement). Core peri-sylvian, frontal and occipital areas were activated bilaterally in all conditions suggesting that processing of affective and linguistic prosodic structures is supported by overlapping networks. The strength of these activations may, in part, be modulated by task and modality of presentation.</description><creator>Copeland, Laura.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Magnetic Resonance Imaging -- methods.</subject><subject>Emotions -- physiology.</subject><subject>Speech -- physiology.</subject><subject>Speech Perception -- physiology.</subject><subject>Speech Acoustics.</subject><title>Audiovisual processing of affective and linguistic prosody : an event-related fMRI study</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q524js57g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xp68kk862</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Communication Sciences and Disorders</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hd76s397k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:20:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Similar to other non-enveloped viruses, the mechanism of cell entry for polyomaviruses is poorly understood. The polyomavirus capsid is an icosahedron composed of 72 pentamers of the major capsid protein VP1. There is one copy of minor capsid proteins, VP2 or VP3, at the center of each pentamer. According to previous studies, polyomavirus cell entry is a multi-step process which includes: 1) VP1 binding to sialic acid (SA) on the surface of host cells, 2) interaction of VP1 with alpha4beta1 integrin and 3) subsequent cell penetration. Biochemical studies have shown that SA alters polyomavirus protease sensitivity, suggesting a conformational change. The aim of this study was to determine these conformational changes at the molecular level. Therefore, we used single particle cryo-electron microscopy to construct 3D maps of wild type (WT) murine polyomavirus, WT bound to SA, a mutant with a disrupted integrin binding site, and the mutant bound to SA. Our results reveal that in both WT and mutant viruses, a significant conformational change happens after binding with SA which is seen as an additional ring of density inside the virus. Moreover some negative densities are seen in the difference map of WT and WT bound with SA, which suggests movement of some viral proteins after binding with SA.</description><creator>Dolatshahi, Marjan.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Receptors, Virus -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Polyomavirus -- physiology.</subject><subject>N-Acetylneuraminic Acid -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Capsid Proteins -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Mice.</subject><title>Conformational changes of polyomavirus during cell entry</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rj430832m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hd76s397k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:r207ts78n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:20:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>BACKGROUND Adult bone marrow derived MSCs had been explored to treat myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure, for which various beneficial paracrine effects had been suggested. Since MSCs in vitro express anti-inflammatory cytokines, we tested the hypothesis that changes in the pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokine ratio in the infarct microenvironment may provide such a paracrine mechanism to improve early cardiac function following acute coronary occlusion. Methods Rats (n=88) underwent acute left coronary artery ligations and were randomized into groups M and C and then injected with culture media or MSCs, respectively. These rats underwent blinded echocardiography to evaluate left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEF). Real Time PCR was used to compare cytokine gene expression for IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 (pro-inflammatory) and IL-10 (anti-inflammatory) at various times. Extra-cellular matrix (ECM) deposition and inflammatory cell infiltration were also analyzed. Results As early as 12 hours, the ratio of pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokine gene expression in group C was significantly lower than group M. Similar results were found at 24 hours, 1 and 2 weeks, respectively. LVEF improved significantly in group C (M=62% vs C=68% at 12 hours* , M=66% vs C=75% at 24 hours*, M=57% vs C=75% at 1 week *, and M=52% vs C=70% at 2 weeks*, *p&lt;0.01). The ratio of MMP-2/TIMP1 levels was lower in the Group C at all time frames, reaching significance at 12 and 24 hours and 2 weeks. In group C, histopathological analysis revealed significantly less ECM deposition (M=1.95% vs C=0.75% at 24 hours*, M=19.30% vs C=9.36% at 1 week*, M=24.46% vs C=7.57% at 2 weeks*, *p&lt;0.01). This was associated with significantly decreased inflammatory cell infiltration after 24 hours. Conclusions The current data suggests that MSCs therapy decreases the pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokine ratio in the infarct microenvironment. This is associated with improved cardiac function, reduced ECM deposition, and decreased inflammatory cell infiltration. This paracrine mechanism of MSCs therapy may explain the early functional improvement after MI before cell transdifferentiation or other mechanisms takes place.</description><creator>Chen, Guangyong.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Myocardial Infarction -- surgery.</subject><subject>Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation.</subject><subject>Cytokines -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Rats, Inbred Lew.</subject><subject>Rats.</subject><title>Mesenchymal stem cells for cellular cardiomyoplasty : the role of anti-inflammatory cytokines</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q524js58r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r207ts78n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9k41zj137</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:20:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We give a concise introduction to the coalgebraic theory of Moore machines, and building on [6], develop a method for constructing a final Moore machine based on a simple modal logic.

Dental students have been found to report stress levels higher than in the general population, with 36% of students reporting significant psychological distress. Canadian dental students have reported an increase in anxiety, depression and hostility. No research was found to have investigated dental education stress using a qualitative analytical approach. Objectives: This study aimed to better understand the experience of stress among dentistry students using qualitative methodology. Methods: 12 recent graduates from the McGill University Faculty of Dentistry were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. Themes from the interviews were identified and coded by reading and rereading the texts until information-saturation occurred. Results: Firstly, four sources of stress were identified: workload pressure, fear of failure, faculty relations, and transition stress. Secondly, three effective coping mechanisms were highlighted by the students: seeking support, focusing on things that they can control, and participating in extra-curricular activities. Finally, three types of students with respect to their experience of stress were found: the highly stressed student, the moderately stressed student, and the relaxed student. This typology of dental student is new information that has not been studied before. Conclusion: Faculties need to identify and aid highly stressed students.</description><creator>Dahan, Haissam.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Students, Dental -- psychology -- Quebec.</subject><subject>Schools, Dental -- Quebec.</subject><subject>McGill University.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of three different facial protection conditions on response time (RsT) and kinematics in a goal directed pointing task: helmet (control), visor, and cage. A 13 light target array and six-camera Vicon Mx system were used to collect response time and kinematic data. Subjects recruited were 16 male and 12 female varsity ice hockey players (n=28). Results demonstrated that although kinematics remained largely unaffected, throughout the visual field test RsT increased significantly with the cage (23 ms) as well as delayed head movement for both the visor (14 ms) and cage (18 ms). These differences may well represent a functional disadvantage to a player's performance given the dynamic, open environment where multiple players contest for puck possession. In summary, further research is warranted to achieve both optimal performance and safety.</description><creator>Dowler, Patrick McLean, 1983-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Hockey -- Equipment and supplies.</subject><title>Effects of ice hockey facial protectors on response time and kinematics</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tb09j902x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w9505412h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jm214s85w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:20:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major cause of acute kidney injury in both native kidneys and renal allografts. Previous studies in our lab have shown that a subset of Eph family receptor tyrosine kinases, including EphA2, is strongly and persistently upregulated in renal tubular cells in both in vitro and in vivo models of the renal IRI. Src kinases are necessary and sufficient for upregulation of EphA2. We have proposed that IRI-induced EphA2 upregulation may serve as a necessary step in renal tubular remodelling. In this study, we have further defined the mechanism of Src kinase-induced EphA2 upregulation by identifying the -145/+137 EphA2 promoter region as the minimal region required for basal and Src kinase-induced activation of the promoter. Moreover, we have identified within this region, at position -45, a canonical cAMP response element (CRE) (Nowakowski et al.), which is essential for EphA2 promoter activation. However, we also found that the prototypical CRE-binding transcription factor, CREB, was not necessary for activation of the EphA2 promoter, suggesting that CREB-related or -unrelated transcription factors are responsible for EphA2 upregulation.</description><creator>Du, Xiaojian.</creator><date>2009</date><subject>Receptor, EphA2 -- genetics.</subject><subject>src-Family Kinases -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Reperfusion Injury -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Kidney Tubules -- enzymology.</subject><title>Regulation of EphA2 expression in renal ischemia-reperfusion injury</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wd376135b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jm214s85w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4x51hp14q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:20:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Using tricaprylin (TC) and trilinolenin (TLN) as substrates, biosynthesis of medium-long-medium (MLM) type structured lipids (SLs), by Lipozyme IM from Rhizomucor meihei and Novozym 435 from Candida antarctica , was investigated to determine their capacity as biocatalysts for the biosynthesis of SLs. At 30°C, Lipozyme IM showed higher bioconversion yield (24.7%) and initial enzyme activity (6.3 mumol CLnC/g enzyme/min) as compared to that of 24.0% and 1.6 mumol CLnC/g enzyme/min, respectively, for the Novozym 435 at 50°C. As a result, Lipozyme IM was subsequently used for further investigations. The SLs were recovered and characterized by silver-ion exchange high-performance liquid chromatography and gas-liquid chromatography. The structural analyses indicated that the major products of the enzymatic reaction were 1,3-dicapryl-2-linolenyl glycerol (CLnC) and 1(3)-capryl-2,3(1)-dilinolenyl glycerol (CLnLn). In order to optimize the bioconversion yield of CLnC, selected parameters, including initial water activity and solvent type, lipase concentration (5 to 20 mg solid enzyme), substrate molar ratios (TC:TLN of 1:4 to 8:1) and molecular sieve (5 to 20 mg/mL, Type 3A), were investigated. The experimental results showed that using hexane at initial aw 0.06, 10 mg solid enzyme/mL and substrate molar ratio of TC to TLN of 6:1 resulted in the highest bioconversion yield of 73.2% of CLnC. However, the addition of molecular sieve to the reaction medium resulted in a 14.0% decrease in the bioconversion yield of CLnC. Using the optimized conditions, the effects of TLN concentration and other selective limiting parameters, including the denaturation of enzyme, aw and the formation of glycerol layer, on the mass productivity (PM), enzymatic productivity (PE) and volumetric productivity (PV) of the interesterification reaction were investigated. Using 80 mM TLN, the maximum PM of 15.5 mg CLnC/g substrates/h was obtained; however, using 200 mM TLN, the maximum PE and PV were 0.07 mg/enzyme unit/h and 6.1 g CLnC/L/h, respectively. The addition of 3 mg Silica gel to the reaction medium resulted in 52.0, 37.3 and 37.3% increase in PM, PE and PV, respectively.</description><creator>Bai, Shan, 1976-</creator><date>2009</date><subject>Functional foods.</subject><subject>Lipase -- Separation.</subject><subject>Triglycerides.</subject><title>Biosynthesis of medium-long-medium type structured lipids using tricaprylin and trilinolenin as substrates</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hd76s398v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hp14q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nv935661j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:20:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>During development of the nervous system, formation of specific connections between nerve cells depends on the stability of growing axons to reach appropriate target cells and form synapses. In culture, hippocampal neurons form numerous synapses by developing axonal and dendritic extensions. To elucidate principles of neuronal signaling and network establishment, creation of neuronal networks in which connectivity and pathways can be experimentally controlled is of great interest. In the present study we used a microcontact printing technique to control and study neurite outgrowth of hippocampal neurons in vitro. My preliminary results show that hippocampal neurons follow the microcontact printed pattern of poly-D-lysine (PDL). In doing so, neurons retain their morphology with normal subcellular distribution of various cell adhesion and synaptic molecules. However, the distribution of various axonal or dendrite components is altered. Hence we have developed a system in which isolated axons and dendrites align with inputs from very few neurons. With this technique we intend to study axon-dendrite communications on a spatially restricted and defined substrate.</description><creator>Belkaid, Wiam, 1983-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Cell Culture Techniques -- methods.</subject><subject>Dendrites -- physiology.</subject><subject>Synapses -- physiology.</subject><subject>Polylysine.</subject><subject>Rats.</subject><subject>Rats, Sprague-Dawley.</subject><subject>Neurogenesis</subject><subject>Hippocampus -- physiology.</subject><subject>Axons -- physiology.</subject><title>Micropatterning of hippocampal neurons : characterization and implications for studying synaptogenesis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tx31qn40n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nv935661j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1n79h812b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:20:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The process of metastasis is initiated through the acquisition of inherent and autonomous motile and invasive properties by tumor cells. These phenomena are initiated through a balance between forward cancer cell membrane protrusion and tail retraction, and occur via cell cytoskeleton remodeling, actin reorganization, and coordinated focal adhesion assembly and disassembly events. Among the vast network of cytoskeletal proteins, the actin-bundling protein fascin plays a major function in cell cytoskeleton remodeling. It is a 55-kDa protein involved in the formation of filopodia and cell migration, and found to be upregulated in many cancers. We report herein key functions for fascin in the regulation of prostate and breast cancer progression. Fascin expression is upregulated in localized and hormone refractory prostate cancer, responsible for a more aggressive clinical course. In addition, functional dissection of fascin reveals a novel function in the regulation of focal adhesion turnover dynamics, by modulating the phosphorylation state of central focal adhesion proteins through a potential collaboration with the protein tyrosine phosphatase, PEST. Together, our data support the importance of fascin in cancer cell invasion and as a significant prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target for aggressive cancers.</description><creator>Behmoaram, Emy.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Microfilament Proteins -- physiology.</subject><subject>Carrier Proteins -- physiology.</subject><subject>Neoplasm Invasiveness.</subject><subject>Prostatic Neoplasms -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Breast Neoplasms -- metabolism.</subject><title>Biological studies of fascin function in cancer cell invasion and cancer progression</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pz50h102g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1n79h812b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k0698c313</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:20:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Many geometry problems can be solved by transformation to graph problems. Often, both the geometry version and graph version of the problem are NP-hard - and therefore not likely to be solved in polynomial time. One approach to solving these hard problems is to use fixed parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms. We present a framework for developing FPT algorithms for graph problems using dynamic programming, monadic second order logic of graphs, tree-width, and bidimensionality. We use this framework to obtain FPT results for covering tour problems on grid-graphs with turn costs. The results for these problems are not practical, but they demonstrate how the basic framework can be used to quickly obtain FPT results. We provide suggestions on further research to improve our FPT results and to apply our framework to obtain new FPT results.</description><creator>Yu, Nuo, 1983-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Graph algorithms.</subject><subject>NP-complete problems.</subject><title>Fixed parameter tractable algorithms for optimal covering tours with turns</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nz806377p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k0698c313</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2j62s853q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:20:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>One major problem plaguing reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.), a high yielding perennial grass, is its poor seed retention. Folded leaf progeny plants from a cross involving a seed-retaining clone were observed in a space-planted nursery. The objectives of this study were to determine whether the folded leaf trait was associated with higher seed retention and other agronomic traits. The inheritance of this trait was also investigated through crosses performed and evaluated in the field and greenhouse. Under solid stand conditions, highly significant differences (p &lt; 0.01) existed between folded and flat leaf polycross progeny entries for heading date and seed retention percentage. Under space-planted conditions folded leaf plants were significantly different (p &lt; 0.05) from flat leaf plants for height, head length, panicle number and growth habit. Widely divergent segregation ratios led to the rejection of the proposed model of inheritance -- disomic inheritance with duplicate gene action.</description><creator>Wrobel, Christopher Richard, 1956-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Reed canary grass -- Genetics.</subject><title>An investigation into the agronomic associations and inheritance of a folded leaf trait in reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g445ch944.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2j62s853q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Plant Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bv73c425s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:20:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In recent years symplectic geometry and symplectic topology have grown to large subbranches in mathematics and had a great impact on other areas in mathematics. When interested in geometry, a geometer always considers geometric structures that arise on immersed submanifolds. In symplectic geometry there is a distinguished class of immersions, known as Lagrangian submanifolds . In particular, minimal Lagrangian submanifolds, called special Lagrangians, are very important in mirror symmetry. Lagrangian mean curvature flow is an important example of Lagrangian deformation. From which we can get the special Lagrangian submanifolds. In recent years, there have been many papers about this subject and the result by K.Smoczyk and Mu-Tao Wang [WS] is very important and beautiful. Our main purpose in this article is to give a new proof for the main result in [WS] from the viewpoint of fully nonlinear partial differential equations.</description><creator>Zhang, Xiangwen, 1984-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Symplectic manifolds.</subject><subject>Mirror symmetry.</subject><title>Mean curvature flow for Lagrangian submanifolds with convex potentials</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j6731766t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bv73c425s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hh63t0584</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:20:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Anger is commonly referred to in the context of aggressive behaviors. However, little is known about more nuanced effects of this emotion on behavior, nor its neural correlates as a subjective feeling state. For instance, several studies suggest that angry people, in contrast to anxious individuals, perceive risks optimistically. It remains unknown whether these opposing effects of trait anxiety and trait anger on risk perceptions manifest in a direct behavioral measure of risk taking. Our first experiment showed, as predicted, that high trait anxiety was associated with pessimism, whereas anger exerted an optimistic bias on likelihood perceptions. However, these biases did not translate into differences in risk taking behavior. Instead of optimism, impulsivity was highlighted as a mediator of risk proneness in individuals who tend to express anger. A second project investigated the neural basis of anger as an affective state elicited by emotionally evocative social scenes. Participants' attention was directed towards transgressors or their victim, which elicited feelings of anger and sadness respectively. These distinct emotions were associated with differential activity patterns in regions related to affective processing; the amygdala, insula and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. Individual differences in trait empathy emerged as strong modulators of these activity patterns. In contrast, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex response to transgressors versus victims correlated positively with an individual's tendency to express anger, suggesting a role of this region in the regulation of angry feelings.</description><creator>Pietruska, Karin.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Risk-Taking.</subject><subject>Magnetic Resonance Imaging.</subject><subject>Brain -- physiology.</subject><subject>Anger.</subject><title>On a quest for understanding anger : the influence of trait anger on risk attitudes and neural correlates of anger as a stimulus evoked affective state</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5q47rs58z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hh63t0584</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9w032663c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:20:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Early language experience is thought to be essential to develop a high level of linguistic proficiency in adulthood. Impoverished language input during childhood has been found to lead to functional changes in the brain. In this study, we explored if delayed exposure to a first language modulates the neuroanatomical development of the brain. To do so, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was carried out in a group of congenitally deaf individuals varying in the age of first exposure to American Sign Language (ASL). To explore a secondary question about the effect of auditory deprivation on structural brain development, a second VBM analysis compared deaf individuals to matched hearing controls. The results show that delayed exposure to sign language is associated with a decrease in grey-matter concentration in the visual cortex close to an area found to show functional reorganization related to delayed exposure to language, while auditory deprivation is associated with a decrease in white matter in the right primary auditory cortex. These findings suggest that a lack of early language experience alters the anatomical organization of the brain.</description><creator>Pénicaud, Sidonie.</creator><date>2009</date><subject>Auditory Cortex -- physiopathology.</subject><subject>Visual Cortex -- physiopathology.</subject><subject>Magnetic Resonance Imaging.</subject><subject>Sign Language.</subject><subject>Deafness -- physiopathology.</subject><subject>Visual Perception -- physiopathology.</subject><title>Insights about age of language exposure and brain development : a voxel-based morphometry approach</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1c18dk26q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9w032663c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:d217qt63g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:20:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a hereditary cancer syndrome that is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner. The disease is characterized by the formation of highly angiogenic tumors in many organs but the main causes of mortality are renal cell carcinomas and hemangioblastomas. Mutations in the VHL protein are responsible for the pathogenesis of the disease. VHL associates with elongin Band C to form the VBC complex. The cullin 2 protein (CUL2) and ring box protein 1 (RBX1) also associate with the VBC complex to form an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the hypoxia inducible transcription factor (HIF2alpha). Mutations in VHL that abrogate its E3 ligase activity lead to increased levels ofHIF2alpha and the subsequent accumulation of pro-proliferative and pro-angiogenic HIF2alpha target genes. VHL also has an important function in the regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) assembly which is independent of its HIF2alpha regulation pathway. VHL's regulation of ECM assembly was shown to have important consequences for tumor angiogenesis and cell invasion. It was shown to be necessary for the proper assembly of a fibronectin matrix and was most recently found to interact with collagen IV alpha 2 (COL4A2). The aim of this thesis is to further characterize the VHL-COL4A2 interaction. VHL was shown to interact directly and specifically to COL4A2 and is necessary for proper COL4A2 matrix assembly. The association of VHL with COL4A2 appears to be independent of its functions as an E3 ubiquitn ligase and CUL2 was identified as part of the VBC complex that associates with collagen IV (COL4). Furthermore, a strategy to identify the binding site of VHL on COL4A2 has been employed and is in progress. These experiments represent the beginning of investigations into the novel interaction between VHL and COL4A2.</description><creator>Ramlal, Nishant.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Extracellular Matrix -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Carcinoma, Renal Cell -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Collagen Type IV -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Von Hippel-Lindau Tumor Suppressor Protein -- metabolism.</subject><title>The von Hippel-Lindau protein and collagen IV alpha 2 : an insight into the mechanisms by which the von Hippel-Lindau protein regulates extracellular matrix assembly and function</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/47429f112.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d217qt63g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:j098zf77q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:20:34Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We define the notion of relative sectional curvature for 2-complexes, and prove that a compact angled 2-complex that has negative sectional curvature relative to planar sections has coherent fundamental group.

The actin cytoskeleton is an integral component of podocyte foot processes and is regulated by a number of proteins expressed in podocytes. Rho-family of small GTPases are known key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. This study, investigated the role of Rac1 in podocytes, using conditionally immortalized mouse podocytes (MPs). We studied Rho-GTPase activities and morphology/cytoskeleton of differentiating mouse podocytes stably expressing nephrin. We also studied the impact of transfection of various Rho-GTPase mutants and IQGAP1 mutants. We demonstrated that nephrin expression potentiates and sustains Rac1 activity during the differentiation process. We showed that Rac1 contributes to process formation in differentiating MPs and may have a similar role in vivo when podocytes are recovering from injuries.</description><creator>Attias, Ortal.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Mice, Transgenic.</subject><subject>Podocytes -- physiology.</subject><subject>rac1 GTP-Binding Protein -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Podocytes -- ultrastructure.</subject><subject>Mice.</subject><title>The role of Rac1 in mouse podocyte cellular process formation and differentiation /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6q182p808.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bc386p337</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p2677038j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:20:36Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Tumour-Node-Metastasis (TNM) classification system of tumour stage does not always reflect the actual tumour mass present at diagnosis. Recent reports propose that volumetric analysis may allow improved stratification of disease recurrence and survival in head and neck squamous cell cancer (SCC). This study aims to assess the prognostic value of tumour volume on the outcome of patients with oral cavity and oropharyngeal SCC. A retrospective review of 73 patients was completed. Tumours were outlined semi-automatically in digitized computed tomography scans, and volumes computed based on surface triangulations of three-dimensional reconstructions with novel software developed at McGill. Results illustrate significant interstage variability within the current TNM model. Moreover, in oral cavity and oropharyngeal SCC, tumour volume as well as T-stage are significant and independent predictors of disease free survival and overall survival.</description><creator>Anand, Sumeet M., 1978-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Prognosis.</subject><subject>Neoplasm Staging.</subject><subject>Tumor Burden.</subject><subject>Carcinoma, Squamous Cell -- pathology.</subject><subject>Mouth Neoplasms -- pathology.</subject><subject>Oropharyngeal Neoplasms -- pathology.</subject><title>The correlation between tumour volume and survival in oral cavity and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3r074z754.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p2677038j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Surgical Research</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x346d780t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:20:36Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Muscle tissue development (myogenesis) involves the formation of specific fibers (myotubes) from muscle cells (myoblasts). For this to occur, the sequential expression of Myogenic Regulatory Factors (MRFs), such as MyoD and myogenin, is required. The expression of these MRFs is regulated posttranscriptionally by the RNA-binding protein HuR, whereby HuR associates with the 3'-untranslated regions of MyoD and myogenin mRNA, leading to a significant increase in their half-lives. Here we show that the cleavage of HuR by caspases at the aspartate (D) 226 residue is one of the main regulators of its pro-myogenic function. This proteolytic activity generates two cleavage products (CPs), HuR-CP1 and HuR-CP2, that differentially affect the myogenic process. Myoblasts overexpressing HuR-CP1 or the non-cleavable mutant of HuR, HuRD226A, are not able to engage myogenesis, while overexpressing HuR-CP2 enhances myotube formation. HuR-CP2 but not -CP1 promotes myogenesis by stabilizing the MyoD and myogenin mRNAs to the same levels as wt-HuR. Conversely, the inhibitory effects of HuR-CP1 and HuRD226A depend on their abilities to associate during myogenesis with the HuR import receptor, Trn2, leading to HuR accumulation in the cytoplasm. Therefore, we propose a model whereby the caspase-mediated cleavage of HuR generates two CPs that collaborate to regulate myogenesis; HuR-CP1 by interfering with the Trn2-mediated import of HuR and HuR-CP2 by participating in the stabilization of mRNAs encoding key MRFs.</description><creator>Beauchamp, Pascal.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Caspases -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Myoblasts -- cytology.</subject><subject>RNA-Binding Proteins -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Myoblasts -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Antigens, Surface -- metabolism.</subject><title>The functional role of the RNA-binding protein HuR in the regulation of muscle cell differentiation /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ht24wp066.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x346d780t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:tx31qn41x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:20:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Cellular Cardiomyoplasty (cell therapy for myocardial regeneration) targets the basic pathophysiology of heart failure and represents a novel technique for augmenting the function of the failing heart. Previous studies have demonstrated massive mechanical losses in the first few minutes. Thus, efforts to reduce mechanical losses may prove more beneficial than those directed against biological losses alone. We believe that "Wash-out" into the disrupted blood vessels is responsible for these early losses. In the first part of this study we hypothesized that by increasing the size of the injectate, the amount of immediate losses can be reduced achieving better retention. Using Alginate-poly-L-lysine-Alginate (APA) miscrocapsules of two different sizes (200mum&amp;400mum) and comparing retention with bare microspheres (10mum) of similar size to MSCs, we demonstrated that immediate retention rate increased by four folds. The retention rate for group 1 (microspheres only) was 4.28+/-3.46% which was significantly lower than that for groups 2 (microspheres in 200mum microcapsules) at 16.45+/-12.66% and group 3 (microspheres in 400mum microcapsules) at 12.93+/-6.28% for Group (p&lt;0.05). There was no difference between group 2 and 3. In the second part, we investigated the potential of gradually increasing the cell load on functional improvement and engraftment using conventional intramuscular delivery. Five groups of rats received escalating doses of MSCs after surgically induced ischemia (gp1 no cells, gp2 0.5x 10 6, gp3 1.5x106, gp4 3x106,gp5 5x106 MSCs). At 7 weeks, we observed significant improvement in cardiac function in groups 3 to 5 compared to post-infarction baseline. This was not observed in groups 1 &amp; 2. However, in groups 3 to 5, we observed no functional advantage for increasing the cell load beyond a minimal therapeutic dose. This is consistent with our hypothesis that small cells are washed out into the circulation. We also showed the ability of Alginate-Poly-l-lysine-Alginate (APA) microcapsules to sustain the viability of encapsulated MSCs in-vitro. Finally, the ability of encapsulated MSCs to improve the function of the heart in-vivo was tested.</description><creator>Al Kindi, Adil Hashim, 1976-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Myocardial Infarction -- surgery.</subject><subject>Stem Cell Transplantation -- methods.</subject><subject>Myocardium -- cytology.</subject><subject>Rats.</subject><title>Cellular cardiomyoplasty : optimizing cellular dosage and retention by microencapsulation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/td96k608s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tx31qn41x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):17600</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
