Some commercial ventilators now offer methods for determining values for lung compliance and resistance at a single frequency, however ongoing research in animals has shown that much more valuable information can be extracted from an analysis of the mechanical input impedance spectrum over a range of frequencies. To do this, it is essential to be able to control the characteristics of the input flow waveform into the lungs (i.e. frequency and amplitude). A new type of mechanical ventilator that measures respiratory impedance over a broad frequency range has been designed and built. It allows for simultaneous application of different ventilatory modes. The design has overcome some of the problems associated with the current experimental systems, such as the use of flow transducers between the patient and the flow source, or the temporary disconnection of the patient during the application of forced oscillations in flow. Generation of flow oscillations is based around a vane that rotates inside a semi-circular housing. The computer-controlled vane can generate volume displacements as low as 20 ml for frequencies from 0.5 to 10 Hz. The new ventilator may serve as a flexible research tool for mechanics studies in ICU patients, and ultimately as a device for routine assessment of respiratory mechanical status.</description><creator>Ahmadi, Mohsen.</creator><contributor>Bates, J.

Among sulphide minerals, iron sulphides are the most common mining wastes. Surface disposal of pyrite and pyrrhotite mine waste is the major cause of acid mine drainage generation and the consequent environmental damages. This thesis investigates the use of new technologies and ideas to improve the disposal of mine waste containing pyrite and pyrrhotite. The first recommended improvement is to backfill the materials instead of disposing of them on the surface. There are new approaches and better technologies implemented in the last few years which enable mining operations to backfill total tailings. The new approach is the use of paste backfill technology, which is one of the focuses of this study. The next improvement, that could be economic as well as environmentally beneficial, is to find replacements for the presently used Portland cement (PC) in paste fill matrixes. The general objectives of this thesis study could be summarised by the following: (1) To study the possible replacement for PC in paste fill containing pyrrhotite. (2) To study the mixture of pyrrhotite containing paste fill and rock fill. (3) To design new binders to replace (totally or partially) the PC used in paste fill containing pyrite.</description><creator>Ameri, Shahriar.</creator><contributor>Hassani, F. P.

The first approach has worked well so far, but more and more investments in instruction scheduling hardware seem to be producing diminishing returns. Parallel processing, on the other hand, has tremendous potential, but has been disappointing in practice. One reason is that parallel computer designers cannot afford to put the same resources into building processors as the makers of commodity chips, who command a much larger market. Therefore, most parallel architects have turned to off-the-shelf microprocessors, which do not support parallel processing well. Multithreaded systems based on dataflow principles promise a solution to the problems inherent in many of today's parallel machines. A multithreaded processor supporting a program execution model designed according to such principles would be a better building block for parallel machines than today's ILP processors, because multithreading and dataflow address the problems facing contemporary parallel machines, such as latency and synchronization. Acceptance of such systems in a world ruled by commodity systems requires taking an evolutionary approach, in which the multithreaded machine is initially emulated on an existing multiprocessor based on off-the-shelf microprocessors, while still achieving good performance, and then transformed into more powerful versions by gradually replacing the stock components with custom hardware. This dissertation is about EARTH (Efficient Architecture for Running Threads), a multithreading model suitable for such an evolutionary approach. The thesis begins with a study of program parallelism which identifies important properties which affect the design of a multithreaded system. The EARTH model is defined at several layers of abstraction, and several implementations along the evolutionary path are discussed. The Threaded-C language, used for expressing algorithms in the EARTH model, is presented, and several applications are written in this language to illustrate its use. Experimental results show that EARTH lives up to its name, that it can run parallel programs efficiently, and that this efficiency improves as the machine moves along the evolutionary path and custom multithreading hardware replaces off-the-shelf hardware piece by piece.</description><creator>Theobald, Kevin Bryan.</creator><contributor>Gao, Guang R.

The objectives of this thesis were to establish an association between AHR in an animal model of asthma and altered contractility of airway smooth muscle (ASM) and to elucidate changes in contractile signalling that could account for any observed differences in ASM contractility. The Fisher strain of rat is spontaneously hyperresponsive to methacholine inhalation challenge relative to Lewis rats. These inbred rat strains provide a model with which to study genetically-determined variations in airway smooth muscle that may underlie AHR. Fisher rats were found to be also hyperresponsive to serotonin (5-HT) in vivo compared to Lewis rats, indicating that their AHR is not agonist specific the narrowing capacity and velocity of contraction of Fisher intraparenchymal airways in cultured explants were also greater than explanted. Lewis intraparenchymal airways in response to 5-HT. In addition, 5-HT stimulated higher Ca2+ transients in Fisher than Lewis ASM, in parallel with their rank order of intraparenchymal airway responsiveness. These results suggest that ASM contractility may be determined by the extent of Ca2+ mobilization in airway myocytes. To examine the mechanism of enhanced intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in Fisher ASM, the role of the inositol (1,4,5)trisphospbate (Ins (1,4,5)P 3) pathway in determining interstrain differences in ASM Ca2+ was studied. 5-HT produced higher levels of Ins (1,4,5)P3 in Fisher than Lewis ASM. This appeared to be caused by a lower expression and activity in Fisher ASM of the type I and II 5-phosphatases which inactivate Ins (1,4,5)P3. Inhibition of 5-phosphatase activity increased Ins (1,4,5)P3-mediated Ca2+ release in ASM from both strains of rat, equalizing Ca2+ signals between Lewis and Fisher ASM. Since Ins (1,4,5)P3 receptor sensitivity to Ins (1,4,5)P 3 was found to be similar between the two rat strains, the differences in 5-phosphatas</description><creator>Tao, Florence C.

This view is that the social and political implications of Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations are conservative and relativist. That is, Wittgenstein's concepts such as 'forms of life', 'language-games' and 'rule-following' defend and promote: a rule-determined and context-determined rationality; or an incomparable community-determined human understanding; or a neutralist, nonrevisionary, private or uncritical social and political philosophy. In order to challenge and correct this conventional understanding the thesis sets up as 'objects of comparison' a variety of very different examples of the use of Wittgenstein in social and political philosophy. These uses are neither relativist nor conservative and they situate understanding and critical reflection in the practices of comparison and dialogue. The examples of this 'comparative-dialogical' Wittgensteinian approach are found in the works of three contemporary philosophers: Thomas L. Kuhn, Quentin Skinner and Charles Taylor. This study employs the technique of a survey rather than undertaking a uniquely textual analysis because it is less convincing to suggest that Wittgenstein's concepts might be used in these unfamiliar ways than to show that they have been put to these unfamiliar uses. Therefore I turn not to a Wittgensteinian ideal but to examples of the 'comparative-dialogical' uses of Wittgenstein. In so doing I am following Wittgenstein's insight in section 208 of the Philosophical Investigations: "I shall teach him to use the words by means of examples and by practice. And when I do this, I do not communicate less to him than I know myself." Thus it will be in a survey of various uses and applications of Wittgenstein's concepts and techniques that I will show that I and others understand them.</description><creator>Temelini, Michael.</creator><contributor>Taylor, Charles (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Tully, James (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Wittgenstein, Ludwig, 1889-1951 -- Political and social views.</subject><subject>Political science -- Philosophy -- History -- 20th century.</subject><title>Seeing things differently : Wittgenstein and social and political philosophy</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6t053h76h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tb09j725t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Philosophy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pk02cc565</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:41:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The objective of this dissertation is to ascertain empirically whether there are non-linearities between interest rates and selected macroeconomic variables in the monetary policy transmission mechanism. This is accomplished by using recently-developed econometric techniques to uncover, and model, the non-linearities. We consider relationships between five variables along the path of the transmission mechanism (commercial interest rates, consumption, investment, output growth and inflation changes) and interest rates over which the central monetary authority has significant control (such as a long-short yield spread or a short-term money market rate). Our findings reveal that there is evidence in favor of non-linearities, with expansionary policy having a smaller impact on the key variables than a contractionary policy in the United States. In some instances we are successfully able to capture these non-linearities using either threshold or neural network models.</description><creator>Tkacz, Gregoire, 1971-</creator><contributor>Galbraith, John W.

IGF activity is modulated by at least six insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) that bind IGFs with high affinity. Recently, it has been proposed that IGFBPs may play an important role in regulating apoptosis. This thesis provides evidence that IGFBPs induce apoptosis in vitro, and are associated with involution of ventral prostate and with regression of androgen-dependent and estrogen-dependent tumors in vivo. We show here that IGFBP-3 induces apoptosis in MCF7 breast cancer cells, and that apoptosis induced by the antiestrogen ICI 182,780 is mediated in part by increased IGFBP-3 accumulation. In the normal rat prostate, increased expression of genes encoding IGFBPs 2,3,4 and 5 is observed during apoptosis induced by castration, the antiandrogen bicalutamide, or the vitamin D3 analogue EB1089. A dramatic increase in IGFBP-5 gene expression is observed during castration-induced apoptosis in androgen-dependent Shionogi tumors. Inhibition of apoptosis in Shionogi tumors with calcium channel blockers attenuates castration-induced IGFBP-5 expression. These results indicate that IGFBP-5 gene expression is related to apoptosis, rather than being strictly under hormonal regulation. Increased expression of IGFBPs 2,3,4 and 5 is observed in regression of DMBA-induced rat mammary tumours induced by estrogen-ablation. Rapid induction of IGFBPs can limit access of IGFs to the IGF-I receptor and may therefore initiate induction of apoptosis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that IGFBPs play a role in apoptosis and suggest that strategies which target IGF pathways may augment the actions of hormone-targeting therapies for breast and prostate cancer prevention and treatment by enhancing apoptosis in tumors.</description><creator>Nickerson, Tara.</creator><contributor>Pollak, Michael (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>A role for insulin-like growth factor binding proteins in apoptosis /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/08612q328.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v692t802t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ng451k304</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:41:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Five experiments with rats were conducted to determine the extent to which associative processes could be used to explain how rats seem able to learn complex CS-US contingencies during Pavlovian conditioning. Rats were exposed to positive, zero and negative CS-US contingencies and conditioned behaviour was compared with predictions derived from both associative models of conditioning and nonassociative normative theories of causal reasoning. A common measure of contingency, Deltap, when used to analyze Pavlovian conditioning requires defining the likelihood of the US in the presence and absence of the CS. Experiments 1 and 2 involved a novel preparation in which, in addition to standard CS presence trials, the absence of the CS was signalled by a second CS, called the trial marker (a lever). Rats were trained to learn relationships in which the CS was either a positive predictor of the US or in which it was unrelated to the US. More conditioned tray entries were observed when the CS signalled an increased likelihood of the US (positive contingency). Consistent with the associative explanations, the trial marker elicited conditioned lever pressing when the CS signalled no change in the likelihood of the US (zero contingency). Experiments 3, 4 and 5 extended the analysis with multiple CSs. These experiments examined whether learning about one CS was determined by its contingency relative to the contingency of other concurrently trained CSs. In experiments 3 and 4 conditioned responding to a moderately predictive CS was determined by its contingency relative to a perfectly predictive CS. Experiment 5 extended this effect to a case in which conditioning was influenced by the presence of a perfect predictor of the absence of the US. Together these results support the hypothesis that relative contingencies determine the strength of conditioned responding. The results are discussed from the perspective of both associative and nonassociative theory.</description><creator>Murphy, Robin A. J.</creator><contributor>Baker, A. G.

Participant observation was conducted over a ten month period. In-depth interviews were held with students, parents, regular classroom teachers, special educators, and administrators. Other sources of data included documents collected in the field, notes from informal discussions, videotapes, diagrams, and photographs. The thesis provides rich description and detailed analysis of the processes and supports used to address the diverse needs of aft of the children in the class. Among the findings: (a) participants' definitions of integration had an effect on the process of addressing the diverse needs of all of the children in the regular classroom, (b) the characteristics of the teacher and the strategies he employed were seen as critical to the success of this integration effort, and (c) reallocation of personnel and resources and provision for scheduled collaborative sessions for teachers were considered to be desirable adjustments to further balance the integration effort and to better fit resources and personnel to the people and area of greatest need. The goal of this study was to provide a richly detailed, comprehensive portrait of the integration process which can serve as a medium through which regular classroom teachers can familiarize themselves with the issues surrounding integration, anticipate problem areas and areas of strength, and plan strategies for success.</description><creator>Neary, Michele Therese.</creator><contributor>Lusthaus, Evelyn (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Students with disabilities -- Education.</subject><subject>Mainstreaming in education -- Case studies.</subject><subject>Inclusive education.</subject><title>An ethnographic study of the integration of students with special needs in a regular class /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rn301298b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/db78td84k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vd66w144w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:42:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The basis of this study was to explore the potential of ultrasonic tissue characterization to accurately detect and reliably quantify the acoustic properties of lingual tissues. The purpose of the work was to establish the fundamental procedures and methodological standards for application of ultrasound characterization to study the human tongue, and to quantify, for the first time, the attenuation, velocity, and backscatter attributes of lingual tissues supported by histologic evidence. Three regions of the intrinsic musculature were sampled. Features of tissue composition, muscle fiber orientation, and macrostructural complexity were defined. The acoustic properties from these regions represented a muscular organ with ultrasonic parameters that differed from the published literature for striated musculature. Further, significant acoustic variations were noted within the intrinsic lingual musculature. Backscatter coefficients predicted the presence of connective tissues, fat and muscle. This acoustic finding was confirmed through histologic image analysis. The concentrations of tissues varied across sample regions. Muscle fiber orientation, fat deposits, and differences in collagen and elastic fiber content supported the postulate that the size of backscatter is affected by the principal cell size and the structural organization of the tissue. The in vitro results are first steps toward a true representation of the acoustic properties of living lingual tissue. The roles of these tissues in muscle mechanics, applications to medical practice in the detection of disease states, and future areas for research are discussed.</description><creator>Miller, Jeri L.</creator><contributor>Watkin, Kenneth L.

However, these towers respond to earthquakes in a different fashion than that of shear buildings. The objective of this research is to propose simplified methods for the seismic analysis of self-supporting telecommunication towers. The author studied the specific problem of self-supporting lattice telecommunication towers using numerical simulations and applying the modal superposition method and the response spectrum technique on ten existing towers, typical of microwave towers usually erected in Canada. The analyses are carried out using a set of 45 strong motion horizontal accelerograms to study the horizontal effects. Vertical dynamic effects are studied using two approaches: the first considering the same horizontal accelerograms in the vertical direction after reducing their amplitudes to 75%, the second using a distinct set of 55 vertical accelerograms. As a first stage, simple regression analyses are performed on the results to yield earthquake amplification factors for the base shear and the total vertical reaction. These factors are presented as functions of the tower's largest flexural period or largest axial period of vibration as appropriate and peak ground acceleration at tower site. They can be used by designers to estimate the expected level of dynamic forces in self-supporting telecommunication towers due to an earthquake. As a second stage, a simplified static method is proposed to estimate the member forces in self-supporting telecommunication lattice towers due to both horizontal and vertical earthquake excitations. It is assumed that the lowest three flexural modes of vibration are sufficient to estimate the structure's response to horizontal excitation accurately, while only the first axial mode will reflect the actual behavior of towers in response to vertical excitation. An acceleration profile along the height of the tower is defined using the spectral acceleration values corresponding to the lowest three flexural mode shapes or the lowest axial mode as appropriate. The mass of the tower is calculated and then lumped at the leg joints. A set of equivalent static lateral or vertical loads can be determined by simply multiplying the mass by the acceleration. The tower is then analyzed statically under the effect of these forces to evaluate the member forces. The maximum error associated with the proposed simplified static method is found to be 25% in the extreme cases with an average error of +/-7%. The effect of including antennae clusters is also addressed in the analysis and findings are summarized in the thesis. The study is extended to include transmission line towers in order to simplify the response of coupled tower-cable system by replacing the cables with an equivalent mass. Several frequency analyses were performed on the system in order to achieve a better understanding of the behavior of the coupled system, however, it was not possible to simplify this interaction in the way desired. Several observations are presented which may help in further studies.</description><creator>Khedr, Mohamed Abdel Halim.</creator><contributor>McClure, G.

Both approaches do not disturb the prevailing environmental and physical conditions nor the existing biogenic processes. An analytical solution to the advection-diffusion equation was used to back-calculate the source strength from the downwind concentration measurements of (i) single and multipoint (4 and 16 points) trace gas (sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and methane (CH4)) release experiments conducted over microplots over an open field, and (ii) single point source SF6 release experiments conducted over a forested terrain. Best predictions of the source strength (to within +/-20%) were obtained from concentration observations made along the centreline of the diffusing plumes with the predictions improving when observations at the mean plume height were used. The diffusion model was then used to compute footprint estimates for neutral and unstable conditions, for tower and aircraft based observation platforms above the forest. They showed spatially constrained footprints in the surface layer, due to effective vertical coupling, so that observations from towers and low flying aircraft must be expected to be very site specific, and scaling up to larger areas will have to be done with careful consideration of surface mosaics. Above-canopy sampling of trace gases to determine volatile organic compound emissions were then interpreted in terms of footprint considerations. This was accomplished by defining the upwind canopy areas effectively sampled under the given wind and stability conditions. The analysis demonstrated, for example, that the variability observed in measured isoprene fluxes could be accounted for by varying numbers of randomly distributed clumps of emitter species within a varying footprint. It suggested that heterogeneity of the forest canopy, in ter Sulphur hexafluoride was also used as an atmospheric tracer in order to estimate CH4 emissions from manure slurry and cattle housed in barns and feedlots.

A PstI restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was detected at the 5' region of the gene and mapped to about 7 Kb upstream of the published promoter sequence. Analysis for association of the marker with traits of economic importance in an unselected, random-bred population of 359 White Leghorns revealed a significant association with egg weight (P ≤ 0.05) and specific gravity (P ≤ 0.05). There was also a trend for association with juvenile body weight (P = 0.08) but not adult body weight. For egg weight the PstI (-/-) genotype was associated with lower egg weight as compared to the heterozygote or the PstI (+/+) genotype. The PstI marker also was found to be significantly associated with differences in trait correlations. A regulatory loop that co-ordinated feed consumption, body weight, egg weight and rate of egg laying was detected, and this regulatory loop differed among the IGF-I genotypic classes. In the PstI (+/-) genotype, the degree of correlation between some of the traits was time dependent, while in the PstI (+/+) genotype it remained constant through the different periods of measurement. Since IGF-I is known to play an important role in immune functions, the association of the IGF-I genotypes with immune traits was also investigated. A significant association was found for delayed type hypersensitivity, interferon production and T-cell count (P ≤ 0.05). Individuals belonging to the PstI (+/-) genotypic class exhibited higher immune response, reflected by the delayed type hypersensitivity reaction and antibody the interactive effects of marker genotypes in the GH, GH-receptor and IGF-I genes on traits and trait correlations indicated that the three are part of an epistatic pathway, wherein the phenotypic consequences of</description><creator>Joseph, Suman C.</creator><contributor>Kuhnlein, Urs (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Chickens -- Growth.</subject><subject>Somatomedin.</subject><subject>Chickens -- Genome mapping.</subject><title>Allelic variations in the chicken insulin-like growth factor-I gene : effects on traits of economic importance in poultry</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zc77sr68k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9w032469m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Animal Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x059c923r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:42:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this dissertation I examine the issues concerning the problematics of historical-textual relations in the wake of the linguistic turn. I begin by showing how the emphasis on the generative rather than the mimetic properties of language has led a number of critics to reject the notion of knowledge as "accurate representation" (Richard Rorty), and then go on to demonstrate how this critical position has undermined the way in which literary and intellectual historians alike have traditionally understood such concepts as causality, human agency and social determination. I show that, in the light afforded by the linguistic turn, there can be no unproblematic distinction between literature and history, text and context, but I also contest some of the more dogmatic versions of this position which make the claim that there can be no such thing as history prior to its textualization, or no such thing as human agency because individual human persons are thoroughly constrained by discursive structures. I suggest that in giving up the notion of an uninterpreted reality, we do not have to abandon the idea of the historically real, of reality, of agency, or of truth. In doing so I examine the work of Alasdair MacIntyre and other critics who provide us with a productive way of approaching the methodological and philosophical issues that are raised by these questions, and then I examine a variety of literary texts which I believe give the questions further historical detail and relevance. In the letters which the twelfth-century abbess Heloise wrote to Abelard, in Geoffrey Chaucer's treatment of the problem of historical-textual relations, and in Brian Friel's inquiry into the linguistic embodiment of traditions in his play Translations we have a variety of testimonies to the dynamic way in which self and world, agency and structure, are related.</description><creator>Jolliffe, Christine.</creator><contributor>Williams, David (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Criticism.</subject><subject>Language and languages -- Philosophy.</subject><subject>Semantics (Philosophy)</subject><title>After relativism : literary theory after the linguistic turn</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6t053h77s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x059c923r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0g354h029</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:42:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The objective of this thesis is to investigate the importance of melt migration in shaping major characteristics of geological features associated with the partial melting of the upper mantle, such as sea-floor spreading, continental flood basalts and rifting. The partial melting produces permeable partially molten rocks and a buoyant low viscosity melt. Melt migrates through the partially molten rocks, and transfers mass and heat. Due to its much faster velocity and appreciable buoyancy, melt migration has the potential to modify dynamics of the upwelling partially molten plumes. I develop a 2-D, two-phase flow model and apply it to investigate effects of melt migration on the dynamics and melt generation of upwelling mantle plumes and focusing of melt migration beneath mid-ocean ridges. Melt migration changes distribution of the melt-retention buoyancy force and therefore affects the dynamics of the upwelling plume. This is investigated by modeling a plume with a constant initial melt of 10% where no further melting is considered. Melt migration polarizes melt-retention buoyancy force into high and low melt fraction regions at the top and bottom portions of the plume and therefore results in formation of a more slender and faster upwelling plume. Allowing the plume to melt as it ascends through the upper mantle also produces a slender and faster plume. It is shown that melt produced by decompressional melting of the plume migrates to the upper horizons of the plume, increases the upwelling velocity and thus, the volume of melt generated by the plume. Melt migration produces a plume which lacks the mushroom shape observed for the plume models without melt migration. Melt migration forms a high melt fraction layer beneath the sloping base of the impermeable oceanic lithosphere. Using realistic conditions of melting, freezing and melt extraction, I examine whether the high melt fraction layer is able to focus melt from a wide partial melting zone to a narrow region beneath the observed neo-volcanic zone. My models consist of three parts; lithosphere, asthenosphere and a melt extraction region. It is shown that melt migrates vertically within the asthenosphere, and forms a high melt fraction layer beneath the sloping base of the impermeable lithosphere. Within the sloping high melt fraction layer, melt migrates laterally towards the ridge. In order to simulate melt migration via crustal fractures and cracks, melt is extracted from a melt extraction region extending to the base of the crust. Performance of the melt focusing mechanism is not significantly sensitive to the size of melt extraction region, melt extraction threshold and spreading rate. In all of the models, about half of the total melt production freezes beneath the cooling base of the lithosphere, and the rest is effectively focused towards the ridge and forms the crust. To meet the computational demand for a precise tracing of the deforming upwelling plume and including the chemical buoyancy of the partially molten zone in my models, a new numerical method is developed to solve the related pure advection equations. The numerical method is based on Second Moment numerical method of Egan and Mahoney [1972] which is improved to maintain a high numerical accuracy in shear and rotational flow fields. In comparison with previous numerical methods, my numerical method is a cost-effective, non-diffusive and shape preserving method, and it can also be used to trace a deforming body in compressible flow fields.</description><creator>Ghods, Abdolreza.</creator><contributor>Arkani-Hamed, Jafar (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Geology.</subject><subject>Geophysics.</subject><title>Melt migration modeling in partially molten upper mantle</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j67315654.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0g354h029</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:c247dt814</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:42:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Hox genes encode homeodomain-containing transcription factors involved in the specification of structures along the anterior-posterior and secondary axes of the vertebrate embryo. Many pieces of evidence suggest that retinoic acid (RA) regulates Hox gene function. The present work involved the characterization of the transcription unit of a murine Hox gene, Hoxd4, its response to RA and its genetic interactions with Retinoic Acid Receptors (RARs) beta and gamma. We have identified two Hoxd4 transcription start sites, P1 and P2. Multiple transcripts were identified by Northern blot, originating from both promoters and multiple polyadenylations signals. Expression of P1 transcripts in the neural tube showed an anterior border at the rhombomere 6/7 boundary, while P2 transcripts are detected more posteriorly. Somitic expression was strong up to somite 6 and weak in somite 5. After RA exposure in utero, only P1 showed a direct response to exogenous RA in the hindbrain, 4 or 24 hours after RA treatment on day 8.5 of gestation. In embryos collected 24 hours after RA treatment, wild-type mice showed a full rhombomere anteziorization of Hoxd4 expression. In contrast, Rarb null mice displayed only a partial anteriorization under the same conditions. The same holds true for the Hoxb4 gene. These results indicate that RARbeta is one of the mediators of the Hoxd4 and Hoxb4 RA-response. Rarg null mutant mice display homeotic transformations of the cervical vertebrae that are similar to a Hoxd4 null mutant phenotype. In order to examine whether Hoxd4 and Rarg he in a common genetic pathway for patterning of the cervical region, we generated mice doubly mutant for these genes and analyzed their skeletons. For two malformations present in single mutants, namely an ectopic anterior arch in cervical vertebra 2 (C2) and the fusion of the basioccipital bone to C1, the penetrance and expressivity in double null mutants was significantly increased. Thus, we conclude that Hoxd4 and Rarg interact synergistically in the specification of these cervical vertebrae. In contrast to Rarg mutants, retinoic acid treatment of Hoxd4; Rarg double mutants on day 10.5 does not rescue normal development of C2. This result suggests that Hoxd4 mediates the retinoic acid-induced correction of this phenotype in Rarg mutants.</description><creator>Folberg, Adriana.</creator><contributor>Featherstone, Mark S.

Farmers rely on little information to manage adequately, these alternatives to fertilizer N. This study documents in spring wheat red (Triticum aestivum L. cv Algot) (i) the agronomic value of (Trifolium pratense L. cv Arlington); (ii) the impacts of application time and underseeded clover an manure N recovery; (iii) the residual NO3-- in the soil profile that constitutes a potential risk of N transfer from soil to air and water associated to clover alone or combined with manures and, (iv) the use of a plant N availability index. A four year field experiment was established an a St. Urbain clay (Orthic Humic Gleysol) at St. Bruno de Montarville (45°33'N; 73°21'W) in 1993. Ammonium nitrate at 0 to 160 kg N ha--1, swine liquid manure (SLM) and dairy solid manure (DSM) were used either alone or in combination with clover ploughed down in fall as green manure. Manures were applied at pre-seeding, in post-emergence or after harvest. The impact of clover on wheat yield was related solely to an improved N nutrition. Clover supplied fertilizer N equivalents of approximately 30 kg ha --1 to the succeeding wheat crop. Clover combined with manures increased available N in the soil profile so that estimated recovery of manures N was strongly reduced in 1995. Apparent N recovery of SLM was higher than for DSM with values of 5% and 17% in 1994 and 1995 compared to 2 and 4% for DSM. Application time did not significantly affect manure N recovery. Limited risk of N transfer to water and air was associated with post-harvest manure application and underseeded red clover because those practices increased soil profile NO3-- in fall and the end of April. Fluxes of N estimated by NH4+ and NO3 -- sorbed in situ on ionic exchange membranes (IEMs) provided better monitoring of N released by added organic N sources than N extracted by 2M KCl and also were bette</description><creator>Garand, Marie-Josée.</creator><contributor>MacKenzie, A.

Oriented and stable monolayers of a dibenzoic acid diamide bolaamphiphile were prepared on the surface of nanosized maghemite (gamma-Fe2O3) particles. The nature of the monolayer was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), while the structure and stability were characterized by diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). The results show that the bolaamphiphile anchors on the surface through chemical bonding between one of the carboxylic head groups and the iron of the maghemite, leaving a pendant carboxylic moiety reactive. A density of the self-assembled films on gamma-Fe2O3 was assessed from potentiometric titration studies of the coated particles in dimethylformamide (DMF). Modification of the carboxy-terminated carriers through a reaction with the ligand diethylenetriamine (DETA), using a typical carbodiimide, enabled the preparation of highly selective magnetic carriers. Potentiometric titration of the reacted carriers indicates a 50% yield of DETA-reacted surfaces. An application of the prepared magnetic carriers in the recovery of metals, such as Cu2+ ions from dilute streams, is demonstrated. The efficiency of carriers in the chelation of copper ions was assessed by complexometric titration. Imaging of the prepared magnetic carriers, using an advanced Pt/C replica technique of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), is presented.</description><creator>Gélinas, Stéphanie.</creator><contributor>Finch, J.

Little is known about the composition and turnover of extracellular matrix in the human intervertebral disc and end-plate with these two pathologies. We studied 121 intervertebral discs representing all age groups and degeneration grades. In addition, fifteen scoliotic discs and seventeen control discs were analyzed. Synthesis in intervertebral discs, end-plates, and scoliotic tissues were measured by immunoassay measuring the content of a putative aggrecan biosynthesis marker (846) and contents of types I and II procollagen markers (CPI &amp; CPII). The percentage of denatured type II collagen was assessed by the presence of an epitope that is exposed with cleavage of type II collagen. We identified three matrix turnover phases in the intervertebral disc and end-plate. Phase I (growth) is characterized by active synthesis of matrix molecules and active denaturation of type II collagen. Phase II (maturation and ageing phase) is distinguished by progressive drops in synthetic activity and denaturation of type II collagen. Phase III (degeneration and fibrotic phase) is illustrated by decreased synthesis of aggrecan and type II procollagen and an increase in collagen type II denaturation and type I procollagen synthesis, the later dependent on age and grade of tissue degeneration. The results of the scoliotic study indicate that synthesis of type II procollagen in the end-plate and annulus was higher in scoliotic discs. Aggrecan synthesis showed a similar trend in the nucleus pulposus of scoliotic disc. By contrast, the contents of hydroxyproline, glycosaminoglycan, and water were significantly lower in scoliotic discs while total protein content was higher in scoliotic discs, indicating that non-collagenous protein content was increased in scoliotic discs. This elevated synthetic activity without an associated collagen denaturation reflects an overall synthetic response without an increased matrix turnover, suggesting that scoliotic changes are due to an altered and ineffective synthetic response to a pathologic mechanical environment. This thesis represents the first in situ quantitation of human lumbar intervertebral disc matrix composition and turnover with ageing, degeneration, and scoliotic change. These observations are an important advancement in our biochemical understanding of disc ageing, disc degeneration, and adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.</description><creator>Antoniou, John.</creator><contributor>Aebi, M.

The goal of this thesis was to provide a cognitive account of the scientific experimental design process by analyzing experimental design as problem-solving behavior (Newell &amp; Simon, 1972). Three specific issues were addressed: the effect of potential error on experimental design strategies, the role of prior knowledge in experimental design, and the effect of characteristics of the space of alternate hypotheses on alternate hypothesis testing. A two-pronged in vivo/in vitro research methodology was employed, in which transcripts of real-world scientific laboratory meetings were analyzed as well as undergraduate science and non-science majors' design of biology experiments in the psychology laboratory. It was found that scientists use a specific strategy to deal with the possibility of error in experimental findings: they include "known" control conditions in their experimental designs both to determine whether error is occurring and to identify sources of error. The known controls strategy had not been reported in earlier studies with science-like tasks, in which participants' responses to error had consisted of replicating experiments and discounting results. With respect to prior knowledge: scientists and undergraduate students drew on several types of knowledge when designing experiments, including theoretical knowledge, domain-specific knowledge of experimental techniques, and domain-general knowledge of experimental design strategies. Finally, undergraduate science students generated and tested alternates to their favored hypotheses when the space of alternate hypotheses was constrained and searchable.

This study develops an account of sentimentality as a model of agency, theorizes the relationship of sentimental ideology to sentimental narrative form, and traces continuities between the sentimental and Gothic modes through an examination of texts that share a preoccupation with the aesthetics and ethics of sentimentalism. By examining representations of sentimental agency in prose fiction narratives by Laurence Sterne, Henry Mackenzie, Ann Radcliffe, and Matthew Lewis, this dissertation argues that sentimentalism was a contradictory cultural discourse rooted in an unstable complex of assumptions about the ontological status and political implications of social identity. Sentimental narrative dramatizes the parodic potential of a code of behavior predicated on the display of a character's virtue in sympathetic response to suffering. Intrinsic to this display is a dynamic tension between the altruistic ideals of the sentimental ethos and the aestheticized, exploitative and self-consciously theatrical mode that often marks its practice. Torn between disinterest and self-interest, between public duty and private desire, the sentimentalist is a conflicted figure whose aggressive aesthetic is increasingly shown to be at once comically bathetic and darkly menacing.</description><creator>Ahern, Stephen.</creator><contributor>Hensley, David C.

This study provides empirical evidence from the perspective of long memory analysis. Evidence of long memory is explored using international currency prices for fourteen countries. The measure of long-term persistence employed is the modified rescaled range statistic proposed by Lo (1991), which tests for long-range dependence after having accounted for a wide range of short-memory processes. Further analysis is conducted on the squared and absolute returns of the series, using the procedure proposed by Geweke and Porter-Hudak (1983). The empirical results provide strong support for long memory in international currency returns, squared returns and absolute returns. Most of the d estimates fall in the range of (0, 1/2), a characteristic of the hyperbolic decay of the autocorrelation function of ARFIMA models in their ability of capturing the long memory property. These findings suggest that models of exchange rate should be made to accommodate the long memory in the conditional mean and variance of the returns. A related issue is the performance in finite samples of the different tests and estimators under Stable-ARFIMA process. Using Monte Carlo simulations, it is found that the traditional and modified R/S behaves in a similar fashion. Different estimators of the long-memory parameter are then compared for processes with stable errors.</description><creator>Assaf, Ata A.</creator><contributor>Galbraith, John (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Foreign exchange rates -- Mathematical models.</subject><title>Fractional integration, stable distributions and long-memory models of foreign exchange rates</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qn59q578b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b8515q06d</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Economics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:js956h61m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:42:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Over-fishing and poor resource management in the northwest Atlantic have led to a drastic decline in the fishery, forcing many communities in eastern Canada to turn to new sources of livelihood. Residents on the Lower North Shore of Quebec are responding to the fisheries crisis by identifying alternative economic development strategies, including a small scale ecotourism industry centred around some of the oldest seabird sanctuaries in North America. Policy makers and communities hope that this type of tourism will generate revenue and employment while also protecting the natural areas upon which local residents depend. Unfortunately, little is known at this time about the ability of ecotourism to live up to this promise. In this context, the central goal of this thesis is to examine the feasibility ecotourism to act as a mechanism for sustainable economic development In order to meet this objective, this research draws upon and refines past attempts by geographers to grapple with the links between the tourism industry and destination development. The thesis shows that the dominant theoretical frameworks of the 1980s cannot provide us with an adequate understanding of the rapidly evolving tourism industry and its role in regional development processes and protected area management. Instead, this thesis adopts post-Fordist theories of tourism development to conduct a microscale analysis on the impacts and underlying structure of the ecotourism industry and its linkages to protected areas and local communities in the region. By synthesizing quantitative and qualitative evidence in the realist tradition, a systematic methodology is generated to argue that a bottom-up, multi-scale network approach provides the greatest potential for promoting more sustainable forms of tourism development.</description><creator>Hull, John Sterling.</creator><contributor>Milne, S.

In this dissertation, I use an institutional analysis to overcome these problems by specifying the structural conditions under which a range of counterhegemonic groups can emerge to challenge state nationalism. The analysis is applied to a case study of interwar Catalonia, which examines three separate campaigns for political autonomy. 1906--1908; 1917--1919; and 1930--1932. Two modes of analysis are used. First, an institutional analysis is used to determine the structural conditions for the emergence of counterhegemonic movements. I argue that levels of institutional incorporation in a state can determine both the conditions under which a counterhegemonic group can emerge and the range of ideologies that can be used to organize against the state. Institutional incorporation refers to the variable level of institutions that together constitute the corporate structure of the state. The institutional analysis is applied to Southern Europe generally and Spain specifically, in order to identify the political groups in early twentieth-century Catalonia which challenged state nationalism by mobilizing around alternative state projects. Second, a rational actor approach is used to examine the strategic interactions of two sets of political actors in Catalonia, nationalists and republicans, in order to specify the conditions under which they attempted to gain political power and obtain political autonomy for Catalonia on three separate occasions. The combination of an institutional approach at the macro-level and a rational actor approach at the micro-level brings to light the importan</description><creator>Harty, Siobhán.</creator><contributor>Meadwell, Hudson (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Catalonia (Spain) -- Politics and government -- 20th century.</subject><subject>Republicanism.</subject><subject>Nationalism.</subject><subject>Catalonia (Spain) -- History -- Autonomy and independence movements.</subject><title>Disputed state, contested nation : republic and nation in interwar Catalonia</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tt44pp728.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pz50gx81b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ks65hd90q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:42:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Effects of environmental conditions and the fatuoid character on the naked trait in oat were investigated. Each of three genotypes responded differently to 2,4-D and 2,4-D increased hull content in some genotypes. In field experiments, there was usually a higher hull content in samples grown in a cool year than in a warmer year, but in growth cabinets, there was no consistent response to temperature treatments. Groats of hulled grains were smaller than groats of naked grains. Among field grown samples there was an association between the proportion by weight of hull tissue in grain and the frequency of hulled grains. With gentle threshing in one of two crosses, the naked versus hulled character fit a 3:1 ratio, i.e., 3 plants with naked grain or both hulled and naked grain:1 plant with only hulled grain. With vigorous threshing the 3:1 ratio did not fit in either cross. The awned character of the fatuoid condition displayed monogenic inheritance according to a codominant-gene model where the expression of the heterozygote was variable. Expression of the fatuoid character was more variable for F2:3 families derived from naked F2 plants than for F2:3 families derived from hulled F2 plants. F2 and F2:3 plants with two or more awns per spikelet produced higher proportions of naked grain than F2 plants with fewer than two awns per spikelet. In most immature florets of fatuoid plants a row of small cells at the articulation zone was observed. This row of small cells acts as an abscission layer in grains of hulled-grained fatuoid plants but not in grains of naked-grained fatuoid plants.</description><creator>Hoekstra, Gert Jan.</creator><contributor>Mather, D.
