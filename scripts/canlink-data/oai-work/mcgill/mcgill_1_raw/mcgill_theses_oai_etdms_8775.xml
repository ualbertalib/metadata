R.J. Rowley (1) extracted the lignin by means of ethylene glycol containing a trace of hydrochloric acid. The glycol-lignin thus obtained had not apparently undergone any appreciable change in structure but as a material for further work it suffered from one defect: in determining the Methoxyl content by the Method of Zeisel, a part of the glycol-residue, attached to the Lignin, is reduced to ethyl iodide and hence renders this value somewhat uncertain. On this account H.Hibbert and F. Brauns replaced the ethylene glycol by absolute methyl alcohol and obtained under otherwise similar conditions a Methyl-alcohol-lignin which differs from the glycol-lignin only in having a methexyl, in place of an hydroxy-ethoxyl radicle.

Chromosome configurations were studied in relation to the different hypotheses concerning the interpretation of chiasmata and the mechanism of chromosome pairing. A ratio of 7l compensating to 35 non-compensating chiasmata was found.Cytological interference was demonstrated. Chiasma frequencies were determined and a reduction in frequency was shown to be due to terminalisation rather than to breaks at chiasmata. Terminal associations were demonstrated to arise from earlier interstitial chiasmata. Movement of chiasmata was shown to be, in some cases, towards the spindle attachment. This is discussed in relation to recent hypotheses concerning the movement of chiasmata. The interpretation of certain configurations was found impossible on the ~classical" hypothesis. In a heteromorphic bivalent, the one chiasma formed must have been the result of previous crossing-over. The greater frequency or asymmetrical arrangements of chromatids is in accord with the "partial chiasmatypy hypothesis". A greater degree of contraction of chromosomes was found at metaphase in the spermatogonial divisions than atmetaphase in the first meiotic division, which is not in accord with Darlingtont's precocity theory of meiosis.</description><creator>Hearne, Edna M.</creator><contributor>Huskins, C.

It is the contention of the writer that no radical departure from the present economic organization which is based on the individual's pursuit of profit as the main economic motive - is necessary to secure this. The outstanding impediment to the realization of maximum production is seen to be industrial depressions and the enforced idleness they cause. An analysis of depressions reveals that price stabilization holds the key to the solution. But the present technique of regulation cannot control the price level and the attempt is made to show how any desired level can be maintained under all conditions. It is shown that the control of the price level can be used to effect a redistribution of wealth. [...]</description><creator>Brenhouse, Samuel Ervin Maitland.</creator><contributor>Hemmeon, J.

It is a gold bearing ore with an admixture of other minerals. A knowledge of the distribution of the gold between native gold, tellurides, and solid solution or fine distribution through other minerals, would give the limits beyond which further dressing of the ore would be unprofitable, and might give a clue to new provisions that would make for a greater recovery of gold: also a more effective recovery of other minerals.

An acetal may be regarded most conveniently as essentially the product of the condensation of an aldehyde with an alcohol, although it may not necessarily be prepared in this manner. Similarly a ketal may be considered as the condensation product of a ketone with an alcohol. [...]</description><creator>Hallonquist, Earland Grand.</creator><contributor>Hibbert, H.

In Part One of the thesis, describing the fall in the value and volume of exports, the significance of Canada's export trade to her economic welfare will be shown, and the importance of exports to particular countries will be considered, as well as the importance of exports of particular commodities. In Part Two of the thesis, investigating the economic effects upon Canada of the fall in exports, the three chief consequences will be dealt with. These are, first, the decrease in value and volume+of production of commodities intended for export; second, the decline in employment and wages of workers engaged in producing those commodities; and third, the drop of price in Canada of commodities a large part of whichlare normally exported but now, although their production may have diminished in volume, remain at home insufficient quantity to over-supply the home market. The period of time over which the studies in this thesis are made extends from 1929, the year in which the depression first came to be seriously felt in Canada, toNovember 15, 1932, on which date the tariffs resulting from the Imperial Conferenoe at ottawa became effective.</description><creator>Greenlees, Stephen.</creator><date>1933</date><subject>Economics.</subject><subject>Exports -- Canada.</subject><title>The Canadian export trade and the depression.</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jw827f523.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qn59q706h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Economics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jw827f53c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T15:42:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of the work described herein was to investigate the catalytio activity of solid and molten metals, especially in referenoe to the current theories of the structure of oatalyst surfaces.

To the ancient Greeks the ideal of the philosopher was to be a spectator of all time and all existence; among the moderns the ideal is the same - to envisage things sub specie aeterntatis, with Spinoza, to attain the spirit of wholeness, with the modern idealists. Even the various contemporary empirical philosophies, pragmatism, instrumentalism, humanism, naturalism, though they reject such phrases as these in their description of the role of philosophy, assert nevertheless that they take all knowledge and all experience as their province.

This reversion was observed in the thyroid remnants of the neck; also, in another series of experiments, reversion to the colloid phase took place in the neck remnants and autotransplants. It was concluded that the changes so produced must be due to a bloodborne factor. A "cyclic hypothesis" of thyroidphysiology was presented, in which it was stated that the body requirements for thyroxin, the thyreotropic hormone and anti-thyreotropic substance, and the mobilization of iodine in the thyroid gland are all interrelated. On this basis the sequence of events due to subtotal thyroidectomy and after partial tracheostenosis was explained. [...]</description><creator>Workman, E. Walter.</creator><contributor>Scrimger, F.
