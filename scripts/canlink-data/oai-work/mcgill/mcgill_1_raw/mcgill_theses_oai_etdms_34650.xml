These vibrations may have long decay time which, can severely affect the performance of space equipments. Passive vibration control schemes often do not have acceptable performance; therefore, it is necessary to devise strategies to actively damp out these vibrations as rapidly as possible. A complex large structure can be viewed as a combination of simpler structural components such as beams, plates, membranes and shells, each of which can be studied separately. In this thesis, a study is carried out on the control of elastic oscillations of cylindrical and shallow spherical shells, using layers of bonded distributed piezoelectric materials as actuators. Using modal discretization the mathematical models of the two shell structures in terms of the generalized coordinates are developed. The expressions for the generalized forces due to the piezoelectric actuators are obtained using the principle of virtual work. To examine the validity/accuracy of this model, a Finite Element Model (FEM) of the system is developed and the results obtained from these two models are compared. Also, the natural frequencies are compared with theoretical and experimental results available in the literature. To develop the control system the state space form of the model is constructed. Three control schemes, Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), pole-placement and velocity-feedback control technique, are used to determine the control voltages that must be applied to the piezoelectric strips to damp the vibrations effectively. Investigations are carried out as to the effect of various shapes, locations and configurations of the piezoelectric actuators on the performance of the control system and on voltage requirements of the actuators. Also, an investigation is carried out to examine the effect of the uncontrolled modes (not considered in the control synthesis model) on the performance of the control system. Moreover, sensitivity of the control system to uncertainties in some physical and geometric parameters of the system is studied. Finally, a state observer is designed using the LQG (Linear Quadratic Gaussian) strategy. The behaviour of this observer in the presence of plant and measurement noise is studied.</description><creator>Ghaeadi, Sirous K.</creator><contributor>Misra, Arun K.

The objective of this work is to determine the best optimum method to predict the grain size in 319 and 356 Al-Si casting alloys by the use of the thermal analysis technique. Different time and temperature parameters from the cooling curve and its derivatives have been analyzed for a variety of grain refined samples. Four different master alloys (Al-6%Ti, Al-5%Ti-1%B, Al-2.5%Ti-2.5%B and Al-5%B) and two salt fluxes (AlTab-75%Ti and TiLite75BC-75%Ti-l.5%B) were used as grain refiners and samples were frozen at two different cooling rates (1.0 and 0.1°C/s). The effect of type of refiner and cooling rate on the thermal analysis parameters has been analyzed. A time parameter, t1, which is the duration of the recalescence period, and the maximum undercooling and recalescence temperatures, TU and TR respectively, yield the best correlation with grain size. These results are consistent irrespective of the type of grain refiner, for both 319 and 356 alloys, but only when the alloy solidifies at a cooling rate of 1.0°C/s). Lower cooling rates produce scattering in the results. Grain growth velocity, as calculated from the dendrite coherency point, correlates well with grain size for both alloys. A grain growth model is proposed to explain the effectiveness of these thermal parameters, where the duration of the recalescence period is related to a free growth period of the grains. Thermal analysis parameters related to the nucleation period seem to be sensitive to the type of grain refiner used and do not show good correlation with grain size.</description><creator>Gloria Ibarra, David.</creator><contributor>Gruzleski, John E.

Similar control is applied for the attenuation of impulse disturbances in the case of vibration isolation. When SMA actuators are used in an antagonistic configuration, relay control has the advantage that the SMA hysteresis is not a concern. This provides a major simplification for the modelling and control of SMA devices. Force and position models for the SMA actuators relevant to control are proposed. Both models are based on a theoretically derived current-stress model for a single SMA fiber. The models are sufficiently true to the original system that control design can be done in simulation and the resultant controllers applied to the actual system without tuning. Three applications are explored in this work: force control, position control, and impulse disturbance attenuation for vibration isolation. Both the step response and tracking are examined for the constrained force control using a two stage multi-relay controller that switches on the sign of the error. The same two stage controller is used to control position and examine the effects of varying the load on the system. As the applied load increases, the limit cycle magnitude increases, greatly diminishing the accuracy of the response. A position/velocity relay controller is proposed to reduce the limit cycle magnitude to a low level, subject to sensing and sampling rate limitations, even with a difficult undamped inertial load. For vibration isolation, an acceleration/jerk pulse relay controller is presented that rapidly attenuates an impulse disturbance. The presented experimental results set a new standard for accurate and rapid control of SMA devices.</description><creator>Grant, Danny.</creator><date>1999</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Accurate and rapid control of shape memory alloy actuators</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gx41mk63s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mk61rj83d</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4f16c438m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:46:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>El largo viaje/The Long Journey deals with the cultural politics of the Communist Party of Spain from 1920, when Communism first emerged in the country, until 1939, when the Spanish Civil War ended. The aim of this dissertation is two-fold. On the one hand, by looking at the Party's cultural discourse, its attempts to provide the working class with a political education, and its relationship with communist intellectuals, it aims at explaining the Party's evolution from its original proletarian line in the early 1920s to its democratic line in the mid-1930s, after it joined the anti-fascist Popular Front alliance. On the other, it aims at investigating how, between the years of 1936 and 1938, the Communist Party ended up fulfilling the democratic revolutionary dream of the Spanish bourgeoisie. Through its work in the Ministry of Public Instruction, the Party brought back to life the cultural discourse and aspirations which the reformist and Republican bourgeoisie had been holding on to since the mid- and late nineteenth century. In doing that, Spanish Communists were using cultural practice to further advance the cause of the democratic revolution, and, perhaps more importantly, to make the Spanish people full participants in that revolution for the very first time.</description><creator>Goméz, María Teresa.</creator><contributor>Straw, Will (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Spain -- Politics and government -- 1923-1930.</subject><subject>Partido Comunista de España.</subject><subject>Spain -- Politics and government -- 1931-1939.</subject><title>El largo viaje the long journey : the cultural politics of the Communist Party of Spain, 1920-1939</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4x51hk88w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4f16c438m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Graduate Communications Program</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2514nn076</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:46:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis consists of analysis of three different data sets: (i) Aircraft-based eddy correlation data collected above irrigated and non-irrigated agricultural land in Southern California during the California Ozone Deposition Experiment (CODE) summer 1991; (ii) micrometeorological tower data, collected over grape and cotton canopies as part of CODE; (iii) aircraft-based eddy correlation flux data above two grid sites in the Canadian boreal forest during the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS), spring and summer of 1994 and 1996. Results from the CODE aircraft data document composition and size of the dominant structures, which transport heat and gases (H2O, CO 2 and ozone) over water stressed and non-water stressed surfaces, and the relative frequency with which structures carrying only a single scalar, or given combinations of scalars, were encountered along the flight paths. Interpretation of results provides further evidence for the existence of a second (nonphysiological) sink for ozone. The relative preponderance of structures that carry moisture, carbon dioxide and ozone simultaneously, particularly in the gradient-up mode, reflects the importance of vegetation as co-located source/sink for these scalars. The detrending procedures described in this study may help to define a more effective separation between local and mesoscale events in biosphere-atmosphere interaction. Results from the CODE tower data indicates a single vegetated ozone sink for the grape site, but a vegetated as well as a non-vegetated sink for the cotton site. For both sites, structures simultaneously transporting significant flux contributions of CO2, H2O, heat and ozone dominate during unstable conditions. During stable conditions, unmixed single flux structures dominated over cotton but not over grape. The results of this study contribute empirical evidence about the relationship between ozone uptake and the physical and physiological state of vegetation, as well as the limitations placed on eddy scales in simulation models. Results from the BOREAS aircraft data shows a decoupling between the surface and the atmosphere, where the patterns of vegetation, greenness and surface temperature may be quite dissimilar to those of the fluxes of sensible heat, latent heat and---to a lesser degree---CO2. Reasons for this lie in the extraordinary boundary layer conditions, high vapour pressure deficit, moist soil and hot canopies, and the response of the vegetation to these conditions. Analysis of the coherent structure compositions to some extent permits the characterization of the different sources and sinks. Overall, this study shows the importance of understanding the various interacting components of soil, vegetation and atmosphere when attempting to design process-based models for predictions in 'micrometeorologiacally' complex ecosystems.</description><creator>Brown Mitic, Constance Maria.</creator><contributor>Schuepp, Peter (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Eddy flux.</subject><subject>Atmospheric carbon dioxide.</subject><subject>Crops -- California.</subject><subject>Atmospheric ozone.</subject><subject>Taigas -- Saskatchewan -- Prince Albert Region.</subject><subject>Taigas -- Manitoba -- Thompson Region.</subject><subject>Water vapor transport.</subject><subject>Atmosphere -- Latent heat release.</subject><title>Flux associations and their relationship to the underlying heterogeneous surface characteristics</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v692t801j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2514nn076</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1n79h624q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:46:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>To determine how neural connections are formed and maintained, and how these connections adapt and respond to alterations in the nervous system, I have examined two aspects of morphological plasticity. First, I have examined the expression of the growth-associated molecule, Talpha1 alpha-tubulin, and its role in neuronal morphology in response to synaptic activity. Second, I have examined the role of one potential molecular extrinsic cue, the growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and its effects on synaptic input. First, I have investigated neuronal responses to elevated levels of trans-synaptic activity using an in vivo rat model of synaptically-induced hyperexcitability of hippocampal connections. In particular, intermittent stimulation for different time-periods induced the expression of Talpha1 alpha-tubulin in specific populations of mature hippocampal neurons. Because adult hippocampal neurons are known to sprout in response to high levels of excitatory input and because Talpha1 alpha-tubulin expression increases during sympathetic sprouting, the increase in Talpha1 alpha-tubulin mRNA in response to intermittent stimulation may reflect an ongoing activity-driven process of synaptic re-modeling in the hippocampus. One potential mechanism whereby activity may mediate some of its effects on morphological growth involves growth factors such as BDNF. To determine whether BDNF could directly regulate synaptogenesis, I focused my analysis on the spinal preganglionic neuron:sympathetic neuron synapse. To test the hypothesis that sympathetic neuron-derived BDNF regulates preganglionic afferent input, two types of mice were analyzed: (i) mice that overexpressed BDNF from the dopamine-beta-hydroxylase promoter (DBH:BDNF transgenic mice), and (ii) mice that lacked BDNF expression (BDNF knockout mice). I found that (i) preganglionic neurons express the full-length receptor TrkB, (ii) in DBH:BDNF mice, preganglionic neurons and axons hypertrophy and hyperinnervate their target, the SCG, (iii) there is no change in the number of preganglionic axons in the cervical sympathetic trunk (CST) in DBH:BDNF mice, and (iv) preganglionic innervation to the SCG is decreased in BDNF knockout mice. These results demonstrate that alterations in neuron-derived BDNF results in changes in synaptic innervation density from afferent input and suggest that a cascade of neurotrophin signalling may exist to establish and maintain the connectivity of neural pathways.</description><creator>Causing, Carrie Grace.</creator><contributor>Miller, Freda (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Trans-synaptic regulation of neural connections : the role of neuronal activity and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tx31qk46w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1n79h624q</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:dv13zw16r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:46:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Rubens' material reality culminates in the tableau which he named Het Pelsken (Flemish for 'The little Fur,' known also as La Pelisse). Of his vast oeuvre it is the most frequently cited work, described by one spectator as an "oil painting of a subject quite unusual...a beautiful woman naked beneath her dark fur." 1 Among art historians the tableau has been the subject of debate as to its 'meaning,' especially since the life-size image does not include narrative paraphernalia that would allow mythological interpretations. But as one scholar wrote, "most are relieved that the work was never meant to be sold."2 This dissertation's trajectory is different. It points to Rubens' late style tableaux, of which Het Pelsken is one, as items painted in an exquisite technique effecting (bodily) presence, and conceived as commodities destined for circulation. Thus the works are heavily invested by producer(s) and buyer(s). Painted in a sophisticated allegorical language that simultaneously defies easy (narrative) access and yet keeps viewers continuously spellbound, Het Pelsken is being reframed together with some of Rubens' other paintings to establish a dialogue with today's audience. This study analyzes the allegorical paradigm by way of Walter Benjamin's dialectics in order to locate levels of truth---which are of relevance to current viewers---and also probes the forces that generate such an overt and repeated display of the feminine body. In so doing, the study also spotlights neo-allegorists, who in their' more recent art practice reconnect with Rubens and disconnect with some compositional and technical strategies of the Baroque master's paintings. These artists include contemporaries Robert Rauschenberg, Peter Dressler and Jean-Luc Godard. 1Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, please see Chapter One for more of his commentary. 2Julius Held's research and response is also taken up in Chapter One.</description><creator>Brendel, Maria Lydia.</creator><contributor>Ross, Christine (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Rubens, Peter Paul, Sir, 1577-1640.

Recently, investigators have uncovered within-group variability among children with LD suggesting that some children with LD are well accepted and even popular among non-LD peers. An appeal in the field of learning disabilities has emerged, calling for a shift from deficit-model research focusing on the deficiencies of children with LD, to the investigation of how children with LD obtain positive social outcomes. Accordingly, a study was undertaken addressing this request by examining the characteristics of peer-accepted children with LD from a multi-rater and multi-method perspective. Using the comprehensive model of social competence proposed by Vaughn and Hogan (1990) as the theoretical framework, data were gathered from teachers, peers, and peer-accepted children with and without LD in important areas of social functioning. Participants were grade four and five mainstreamed students meeting the following criteria: (a) having a researcher-identified learning disability in at least one academic area (reading, spelling, or arithmetic) and (b) peer-rated social acceptance as determined via a modified version of the Asher and Dodge (1986) sociometric classification system. Statistical analyses consisted of multivariate and univariate techniques. Findings indicated few significant differences between peer-accepted children with and without LD in specific areas of social competence as rated by peers. Significant interactions, however, between LD status and gender revealing variable profiles of social-behavioural characteristics for boys and girls with and without LD did emerge from the perspective of teachers. Implications for special education referral and placement, inclusive education, and interventions are discussed.</description><creator>Brown, Andrea E.</creator><contributor>Heath, Nancy L.

Mutants unable to utilize the degradation intermediates, 3-hydroxybutyrate (HB) and/or acetoacetate (AA) were characterized. A mutant unable to utilize HB (Hbu-) while retaining the ability to utilize AA was found to be deficient in 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (Bdh) activity. The bdhA mutant showed no symbiotic defects in association with alfalfa plants. However, when co-inoculated with the wild type, the mutant showed significantly reduced competitiveness. A more severe competition defect was observed for a PHB synthesis mutant (phaC). Both these mutants also showed reduced competitiveness when subjected to multiple cycles of subculturing through alternating carbon-rich and carbon-poor media, with the phaC mutant showing a greater loss in competitiveness. The results indicate that the ability to efficiently deposit and utilize cellular PHB stores is a key factor influencing competitive survival under conditions of fluctuating nutrient carbon availability. The gene encoding Bdh (bdhA) was isolated and sequenced. Two transcription start sites, S1 and S2 were identified but no known consensus promoter sequences were identified upstream of either start site. A sigma 54 consensus binding sequence was found to be located between S1 and S2 but no corresponding transcript was detected. Transcriptional bdhA-lacZ fusion studies indicated that gene expression was growth-phase associated. The bdhA gene from Rhizobium sp. NGR234 was also isolated and characterized and found to be highly homologous to the R. meliloti bdhA sequence. Unlike R. meliloti , NGR234 is able to accumulate PHB during symbiosis. An NGR234 bdhA mutant showed symbiotic defects on Leucaena but not on Tephrosia, Macroptilium or Vigna host plants, indicating that the phenotype was host-dependent. Mutations that suppress the Hbu- phenotype without restoring Bdh activity were identified, indicating the existence of a Bdh-independent pathway for HB utilization. These mutations mapped to the age-1 locus, which causes enhanced growth rate on HB and AA minimal media. Introduction of plasmid-borne multiple copies of a gene encoding acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase (acsA) into the bdhA mutant also results in suppression of the Hbu- phenotype. A possible mechanism of suppression involving direct activation of HB to 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, followed by reduction to acetoacetyl-CoA by the NADP-acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (encoded by phaB) was investigated. A strain carrying the triple mutations, age-1::Tn5-Tp, bdhA ::Tn5 and phaB::OSmSp retained the ability to utilize HB, indicating that the bypass mechanism does not involve NADP-acetoacetyl-CoA reductase. The phaB mutant does not accumulate PHB or utilize HB or AA. Furthermore, colonies of the phaB and phaC mutants exhibit non-mucoid phenotype on yeast extract mannitol agar. The observation that a R. meliloti exoS null mutant is also Hbu- provides further support for a link between PHB and exopolysaccharide synthesis. Since ExoS is a positive regulator of succinoglycan biosynthesis it is hypothesized that regulation of succinoglycan synthesis by ExoS requires PHB synthesis.</description><creator>Aneja, Punita.</creator><contributor>Charles, Trevor C.

Amblyopia (from the Greek, meaning "blunt vision") is a developmental monocular deficit arising in an estimated 5% of children and is the most common cause of unilateral blindness in the adult population. The condition is primarily associated with a strabismus (misalignment of an eye) or anisometropia (unequal refractive error in the two eyes) or both (mixed amblyopia) being present at or shortly after birth. The strabismic amblyopic deficit includes a decrease in contrast sensitivity, with an accompanying loss in acuity. This population is unique in that unlike the anisometropic group, they experience spatial distortions and non-contrast dependent anomalous spatial localization. This has led to the proposition that tarachopia or "distorted" vision may be a better descriptive term to use as opposed to amblyopia or "blunt" vision. In an effort to characterize the distortions that strabismic amblyopes perceive, we have quantified the deficit in spatial localization across the dimensions of spatial scale, eccentricity and exposure duration. The results show that: (1) the deficits of spatial localization, spatial uncertainty (increased alignment threshold) and bias (perceived point of subjective alignment) are uncorrelated; (2) both deficits are scale invariant for well separated elements; (3) the form of the regional distribution depends on the spatial measure used and the scale at which it is measured; (4) there is a poor correlation between the deficit for either spatial measure and the contrast sensitivity loss; and (5) spatial uncertainty is invariant with exposure duration. In addition we have sought to characterize the neural substrate of the spatial deficits. We psychophysically probe the sampling properties of the neuronal population and analyze the dependence of simple pattern discrimination on stimulus bandwidth properties. Our results show that the detection deficit due to neural pooling is effective in limiting the spatial frequencies where sampling considerations are important. Within this region of visible high frequencies, an irregular arrangement of neurons rather than neural loss is the greater contributor to the strabismic amblyopes' deficit. In addition, the amblyopic eye either has broader orientation and spatial frequency detectors or is deficient only for first-order orientation processing.</description><creator>Demanins, Rita.</creator><contributor>Hess, Robert F.

In the first part of the thesis, we concentrate on the onset of instability in a thin superconducting ring. A periodic instability appears when current is driven by an applied external voltage to the point of instability at temperatures below the critical temperature. The main contribution of this study is to investigate how the new state is selected when the system reaches the point of instability. That is, how the selection process is affected by different factors, such as the rate at which the system is driven. In addition, the generation of Ohmic resistance due to the dissipative phase slip state at the point of instability is studied. The problem of state selection at the onset of instability is a generic problem in pattern formation systems. Our results show that the onset of dissipation leads to strong non-linear effects in the state selection process. In the second part of this thesis, we study the nonequilibrium behavior of driven charge-density waves in random media in two spatial dimensions. We propose a novel model for charge-density wave dynamics based on the Swift-Hohenberg equation. The advantage of our model is that it includes both amplitude and phase fluctuations of the condensate. We derive the model and show its formal relation to the almost universally used elastic models for charge-density waves. We demonstrate that phase slips proliferate close to the depinning transition thereby rendering a phase-only description invalid. Finally, using our model, we explain two recent experiments that cannot be captured by the traditional elastic approximation; the dynamical x-ray scattering experiments by Ringland et al. [99b], and low temperature transport experiments by Lemay et al. [99].</description><creator>Karttunen, Mikko.</creator><contributor>Grant, Martin (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Physics, General.</subject><title>Study of the dynamics of driven periodic systems : charge-density waves and superconducting rings</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x346d597k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ng451k29c</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k06989184</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:47:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The implementation of sustainable development is the social imperative of the 21st century, requiring strong leadership by governments at all levels. As the logical convenor of constituent groups in civil society, governments have a key role to play in diffusing its concepts and practices in the next decade, before critical thresholds are reached. This role will not be realized, however, without a guiding framework across governments that provides consistent and effective leadership to other sectors of Canadian society, equally supported by a new framework for governance based on human responsibility and the interconnectedness of human and natural systems. These frameworks are grounded on the reconciliation of three imperatives, the ecological, the social and the economic, based on analogues taken from ecological systems. Principles such as integrity, cyclical processes, resilience and systems approaches are key, as are the many alternative paradigms circulating within society capable of providing new information about the ways in which our systems operate.</description><creator>Dale, Ann, 1948-</creator><contributor>Hill, Stuart (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Sustainable development -- Government policy -- Canada.</subject><subject>Environmental policy -- Canada.</subject><title>Sustainable development : a framework for governance</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pc289k78q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k06989184</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3b591b080</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:47:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Schizophrenia is a complex disease that affects up to 1% of the general population. It is manifested by a variable number of negative, positive and disorganisation symptoms giving rise to an important diversity in the expression of this syndrome. The treatment of schizophrenia is mainly based on neuroleptic drugs that alleviate, to a variable extent, psychotic symptoms in the majority but not all the patients. Although its aetiology is still unknown, it is now well established that schizophrenia is a brain disease resulting from the combination of environmental and genetic risk factors. In spite of intensive research, no specific genes were convincingly associated with schizophrenia possibly because of the presence of genetic heterogeneity. In this work, it was hypothesised that schizophrenic patients with excellent long-term response (R) and those with very poor long-term response to conventional neuroleptics (NR) may differ, at least partially, with respect to the pathogenesis of their disease. In this thesis we aimed at validating this classification scheme and illustrating its usefulness for genetic studies. In accordance with this hypothesis, it was found that NR differ from R patients with respect to age at onset, premorbid social adjustment, neuropsychological profiles and family history of psychiatric disorders. Molecular genetic investigations identified 2 genes, the hGT1 and 5-HT2a-receptor genes, that were associated respectively with responsive and nonresponsive schizophrenia, thus showing the utility of categorising patients according to their therapeutic response. A third gene, called hSWI2/SNF2 was also found to be associated with schizophrenia irrespective of therapeutic response to neuroleptics. In addition, a potentially abnormal protein was detected in two schizophrenic patients but not in controls. In conclusion, the distinction of schizophrenic patients belonging to the two extremes of long-term responsiveness to neuroleptics may help in iden</description><creator>Ridha, Joober.</creator><contributor>Rouleau, Guy (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Psychology, Clinical.</subject><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><subject>Psychology, Psychobiology.</subject><subject>Biology, Genetics.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</subject><title>Neuroleptic therapeutic response and genetics of schizophrenia</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pk02cc58q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3b591b080</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:02870x63s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:47:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The unique architecture of branched oligonucleotides was exploited to study compounds that associate as two parallel duplexes with intercalating C•C+ base pairs (i-motif DNA). The formation of a branched cytosine tetrad was induced by joining the 5'-ends of a pair of pentadeoxycytidine strands with a branching riboadenosine (rA) linker. This arrangement causes the orientation of the dC strands to be parallel, and forces the formation of a C•C+ duplex that self associate into i-DNA. Presence of the i-motif in this structure is supported by thermal denaturation, native gel electrophoresis, CD, and NMR spectroscopy. To further characterize the nature of the sugar-sugar interactions in the i-motif, branched oligonucleotides containing D-arabinocytidine and D-ribocytidine were synthesized and their association properties examined. The branched D-deoxycytidine analogue, rA(2',5'-dC 5)-3',5'-dC 5 (dV-5) served as model system. It is found that the arabinose substitution leads to hypochromic structures that are characteristic of four-stranded intercalated DNA and has little, if any, effect on the stability of the complex formed. Parallel experiments with the branched ribocytidine analogs gave very weak or no discernible UV transitions, consistent with no strand association in this case. These results are discussed in relation to expected steric interactions of oligocytidine strands within the 1-motif. A divergent approach for the construction of branched nucleic acids was also studied. Chain assembly took place on the surface of controlled-pore glass solid support in the unconventional 5' to 3 ' direction. The branch junctures were introduced by use of N6-benzoyl-2',3'-O-bis(dimethoxytrityl)adenosine-5 '-O-(N,N-diisopropyl)-beta-cyanoethylphosphoramidite. Various dendrimers were prepared in comparable or better yields relative to the well-established convergent approach.</description><creator>Robidoux, Sébastien.</creator><contributor>Damha, Masad J.

This study offers a new approach for investigating the influence of tailings deposition rate over the structural behavior of upstream tailings dams, and its relation to the construction sequence and pond operation. A complex, yet practical method uses a nonlinear numerical algorithm, integrating a 1-dimensional self-weight consolidation model for fine grained materials, with a 2-dimensional stress-deformation finite element program for consolidation of earth structures. A beach profile equation is used to complete the structural geometry of the dam at various operating stages. The dam behavior is evaluated based on excess pore water pressure profiles, principal effective stress levels, and mobilized material strength. The time-dependent pond filling operation process and staged dam construction are simulated. A case study from a large operating South African gold mine is used to perform simulations and parametric analyses. The behavior of the upstream tailings dam is assessed under both normal and increased slurry discharge rates. It is shown that under variable deposition rates, the present approach can help identify weak structural zones, and hence, improve the assessment of the structural dam safety. From such analyses, adequate tailings deposition rates conditions could be determined in advance for a variety of mill or pond operating conditions.</description><creator>Priscu, Caius.</creator><contributor>Mitri, Hani S.

John Dewey, a distinguished American thinker, represents a naturalist pragmatist conception of self-realization on the one hand, and 'Allama Tabataba'i, a renowned Muslim philosopher, an Islamic perception on the other. While Dewey is considered a spokesperson for modern American pragmatist and humanist thought, 'Allama may be seen as typical of Islamic Shi'i thinking. In dealing with their conceptualizations of self-realization, the intention in this study is to focus on some significant aspects of the human self, to rediscover its potentiality and to determine the wisdom behind self-realization from a comparative perspective. After outlining the two thinkers' scholarly backgrounds, instructional contexts, sources, methods, works and purposes, the study examines certain specific issues. It investigates their understandings of human nature, and explores their positions on moral experience and human character, as well as on the arts and sciences as vehicles for self-realization. As its final chapter, the study elaborates the basic elements and manifestations of self-realization as depicted in Dewey's and 'Allama's systems of thought. This research aims at clarifying the parallels, similarities and differences that exist between the two scholars, through an in-depth comparison of their respective naturalist and Islamic approaches and attitudes.</description><creator>Rahnamaei, Seyed Ahmad.</creator><contributor>Smith, David C.

The first group consists of network-modifier cations which have ionic radii ≳ 87.2 pm and coordination numbers equal to, or higher than, 5 (e.g. Ca2+, La3+, U4+). The second group involves cations with ionic radii ≲ 87.2 pm. They have at least two coordination numbers: the first one is always 4 and the second is ≥5; for this reason they are called amphoterics (e.g. Li1+, Mg2+, Al3+). The third group contains cations with variable crystal field stabilization energies (e.g. Fe2+, Ni2+, Cr3+), and the fourth group includes cations with a lone pair of electrons (e.g. Pb 2+, Bi3+, Te4+). Immiscibility data suggest that the origin of phase separation is associated with coulombic repulsions between poorly screened cations. The larger the ionic potential of a cation, the greater the repulsions with its neighbours, and the larger the size of its immiscibility field. However, amphoterics do not obey this rule because network-formers like SiO2 exert a structural control upon immiscibility which creates a selective solution mechanism that affects cations with radii ≲ 87.2 pm. Such small cations appear to be capable of fitting in pentagonal-like cages where they adopt a 4-fold coordination. In tetrahedral coordination, the bonds have a greater covalent character and the oxygens are more polarized towards the amphoterics which efficiently shield their positive charges, reducing coulombic repulsions and thus immiscibility. Experiments performed in the system CaO-MgO-SiO2 at 1.0 GPa show that pressure has little effect on miscibility gaps associated to network-modifiers such as Ca2+ and "weak" amphoterics like Mg 2+. However, it is shown that amphoterics with substantial fractions of cations in 4-fold coordination and cations with variable crystal field stabilization energies capable of high spin to low spin transitions are expected to enlarge their immiscibility fields at high pressure. Magmas rich in these cations are potential candidates to develop phase separation at depth. Experiments were also performed in the systems CaO-SiO2 and MgO-SiO2 at 1.0 GPa and results were combined with all the currently available phase equilibria and thermodynamic data at 1 bar in the same systems to critically optimize the thermodynamic properties of the liquid phase at low and high pressures. Assessments were made with the modified quasi-chemical model of Blander &amp; Pelton using a computer program that simultaneously optimized all reliable data to give a small set of excess Gibbs free energy parameters. Pressure was found to have little effect on the topology of the CaO-SiO2 system but a pronounced one on the MgO-SiO2 binary. These contrasting behaviours from two homovalent and isochemical cations are linked to the polymorphic transition of the magnesium metasilicate. The amphoteric nature of the Mg2+ cation in the liquid phase makes MgO-SiO2 melts compressible but this effect appears to be small.</description><creator>Hudon, Pierre.</creator><contributor>Baker, Don R.

In the 1990's, food security reached the national agenda for action, yet no study had described the nutrition and sociodemographic characteristics of a random sample of food bank provision recipients, specifically their nutrient intake throughout the month or at the end of the month when food and money are thought to be most limited. Preliminary studies, at two sites identified the contents of food bank provisions and the clientele to be surveyed. Thereafter, 490 food bank users were randomly selected from a stratified random sample of 57 Montreal area food banks. A dietitian-administered sociodemographic questionnaire and 24-hour dietary recall were completed upon client enrolment at the food banks; following this, three further in-person 24-h recall interviews were conducted, week-by-week over the month. Sixty-two people did not complete all interviews. The 428 people completing four interviews were primarily healthy, well-educated adults (overall mean age 41.5 +/- 12.6 years; men 41.4 +/- 12.2 and women 41.4 +/- 13.0 years) who perceived the food banks as a necessary community service. The frail elderly and single parents with large families did not use food banks. Mean energy intake was similar to the general Quebec population (10.2 and 7.9 MJ for men and women, respectively) and macronutrient intake was stable throughout the month. With the exception of calcium, mean nutrient intakes met recommended levels and were not influenced by income-week nor by energy intake variability. Intakes of several nutrients were related to frequency of food bank use, household size, smoking, education and country of birth.

Changes in the expression pattern of CEA and NCA in a wide variety of cancerous tissues has raised the possibility that they could contribute to neoplastic and malignant transformation by influencing tissue architecture and differentiation. This study revisits the expression pattern of CEA and NCA in colorectal tumorigenesis by emphasizing the accurate quantitation of cell-surface levels in the context of tissue architecture. FACSRTM analysis of highly purified tumor versus normal colonic epithelial cell suspensions, revealed dramatically higher levels of cell-surface associated CEA and NCA in tumor cells that was inversely correlated with histologic differentiation. Furthermore, a marked tendency towards delocalized expression and a multilayered tissue architecture was noted in less differentiated tumors. Increased levels of call-surface CEA and/or NCA (CEA/NCA) in colonocytes capable of differentiation was directly tested for effects on tissue architecture and differentiation with established in vitro assays and a novel in vivo colonic tissue architecture assay developed and presented as part of this thesis. The results demonstrate that overexpression of CEA/NCA on the surface of colonocytes can prevent cellular polarization, disrupt colonic tissue architecture and block differentiation both in vitro and in vivo.</description><creator>Ilantzis, Christian.</creator><contributor>Stanners, Clifford P.

It investigates the ways in which the production and consumption of images in the context of the North American family contributed to the development of a distinctly domestic and privatized visual culture, and the transformation of the home into a site for privatized spectatorship. Four cultural forms (No. 1 Kodak, Box Brownie, Cine Kodak and Cine Kodak 8) are specified in this development, all pioneered by the Eastman Kodak Company. The dissertation traces Eastman Kodak's direct involvement in the popularization of image practices. It analyzes strategies used by them to make this possible, namely an appeal to the becoming lifestyles of the bourgeois and middle-classes. The analysis links the popularization of image-making and consuming practices to other popular amusements (i.e. cycling, cinema-going) to work against an artifact-centred analysis. Issues of gender and generation are critically evaluated as concepts used to instill image-making as a popular, family practice. Shifts in modern temporal and spatial experience, as well as mobility are also explored in relation to popular image-making.</description><creator>Johnson, Stacey.</creator><contributor>Straw, Will (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Photography -- History.</subject><subject>Photography -- Social aspects.</subject><subject>Eastman Kodak Company -- History.</subject><subject>Amateur films -- History and criticism.</subject><title>Taking pictures, making movies and telling time : charting the domestication of a producing and consuming visual culture in North America</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hq37vq22x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r494vm707</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Graduate Communications Program</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ks65hd88p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:47:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Connecting with Courage (CWC) is a three-day Outward Bound self-discovery programme, designed by women for women. It was developed to bring feminist theory to bear on outdoor and experiential education (OEE). The re-thinking of OEE research from a feminist standpoint is less than two decades old. It began by challenging previous assumptions about participants in OEE as male and set out to explore women's different experiences and needs in OEE programmes. However while this new literature criticised the standard OEE literature for universalising male participants' experiences, it tended to provide a universalist and essentialist view of women's experiences and needs in OEE. More recently, this latter tendency has been criticised by a small number of writers within the women-and-OEE literature. This study examines women's experiences during and after four of Outward Bound's CWC courses in light of some branches of contemporary feminist theory. The study employs qualitative methodology placing the researcher at CWC as both a participant and observer, and carrying out individual open-ended, semi-structured, in-depth, ethnographic interviews with 21 women. The study explores the limitations of the standard OEE framework and the women-and-OEE literature. Its central contribution is to show how women's experiences at CWC and their subsequent understanding of these experiences can be interpreted differently depending on the theoretical framework used. The study highlights the potential of contemporary feminist theory in four respects. First it illustrates the value of re-thinking the universalist concept of woman by exploring how sexual identity, as one example of social difference, is relevant to experience. Second the study validates Carol Gilligan's notion of the self as relational while examining contemporary feminist theorisations of the self. Thus, third, it also demonstrates how far more nuanced and rich insights can be derived by employing a postmodern-inspired f</description><creator>Cowin, Louise.</creator><contributor>Jackson, Nancy S.

These functions of p53 can be regulated by protein-protein interactions and by phosphorylation. The interferon (IFN)-inducible, double-stranded RNA activated protein kinase PKR is a serine/threonine kinase that mediates the antiviral and antigrowth effects of IFNs by inhibiting protein synthesis through the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF-2alpha. Both PKR and p53 have the capacity to inhibit cell growth and to modulate gene expression at both the transcriptional and translational level. However, the exact molecular mechanism(s) behind the regulation of cell growth by PKR are not-well understood. Based on previous reports demonstrating a cross talk between other IFN-inducible proteins and p53, it was of interest to examine whether and how PKR might modulate p53 function to explain the ability of PKR to regulate cell growth. This study demonstrates that PKR can physically, functionally and genetically interact with p53. PKR and p53 physically interact both in vivo and in vitro, and the interaction of PKR with p53 is a functional one since PKR can directly phosphorylate p53 on serine392 in vitro. Furthermore, studies using PKR+/+ and PKR-/- cells treated with adriamycin or expressing a temperature sensitive mutant of p53, showed that p53-mediated gene expression and G0/G 1 arrest was inhibited in PKR-/- cells. The phosphorylation levels of serine18 of p53, which plays a role in p53 function in vivo, was inhibited in PKR+/+ cells expressing temperature sensitive p53 compared to PKR-/- cells. Induction of serine18 phosphorylation was inhibited in PKR-/- cells in response to gamma-radiation and adriamycin but not ultraviolet radiation. While PKR does not directly phosphorylate serine18 of p53 in vitro, the specific phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase inhibit</description><creator>Cuddihy, Andrew Robert.</creator><contributor>Koromilas, Antonis E.

In the case of DSA, tensile tests were carried out over the range from room temperature to 450°C and at strain rates of 10-4 to 10-1 s-1 . The DSA behavior was also studied in torsion in the austenite and ferrite regions. Aging index (AI) tests were carried out to evaluate the response to SSA and to estimate the amount of carbon in solution after employing various cooling rates. In all cases, although the atomic Ti/C ratio was greater than one, even still air cooling (3°C/s) led to a supersaturated/unstabilized material and to the occurrence of both DSA and SSA. By contrast, there were no signs of SSA and DSA after furnace cooling (0.05°C/s). The three Ti and the Ti-Nb IF grades studied displayed serrated flow behavior at all strain rates in the blue brittleness temperature range (100 to 300°C). A simple model is described that predicts whether or not DSA will occur at the strain rates and temperatures involved in the processing of IF steels. It was found that the higher the Ti/S ratio, the higher the solute C. Steels with different chemistries but equal Ti/S ratios displayed the same aging behavior. Internal friction measurements were executed to establish a calibration between the AI values and solute C levels. Two novel techniques for the strengthening of IF steels by dynamic bake hardening (BH) are presented. These techniques lead to much higher BH values compared to those produced by conventional BH methods. The observations also show that when C supersaturation results from cooling after coiling, lower annealing temperatures after cold rolling lead to higher solute C levels.</description><creator>Dehghani, Kamran.</creator><contributor>Jonas, J.

Under greenhouse conditions, these fungal isolates caused high mortality and significant plant dry weight reduction in C. difformis, C. iria, and F. miliacea when sprayed at the rate of 1 x 108 spores/m3. Cross-pathogenicity of the isolates was demonstrated in three other sedge weed species. C. difformis, C. iria, and F. miliacea were killed but C. rotundus was resistant. Most of the thirteen rice varieties tested were resistant to the fungal isolates. The order of decreasing pathogenicity to rice was C. oryzae (93-061), C. tuberculata (93-020), and C. tuberculata (93-022). The infection process of C. tuberculata and C. oryzae was similar. Spore germination was polar for C. tuberculata and bipolar for C. oryzae. Germ tube growth was random and branching. Appressoria were formed preferentially over epidermal cell wall junctions on sedge hosts and over stomatal apertures in rice. Complex infection cushions were observed only on sedge hosts. Infection hyphae developed inter- and intracellularly, causing epidermal cell walls to separate and mesophyll cells to shrink and collapse. The vascular bundles were not invaded. Colonization of susceptible weeds was rapid and conidiophores emerged from the stomatal aperture between 96 to 120 hours post inoculation (HPI). Resistance to C. tuberculata and C. oryzae in C. rotundus and rice was expressed as a delay in appressorial formation, inhibition of fungal growth after penetration, and lack of sporulation.</description><creator>De Luna, Lilian Z.</creator><contributor>Watson, Alan K.

Preliminary experiments clarified that this root disease could be suppressed by strains of Pseudomonas aureofaciens, P. corrugata, and P. fluorescens. To determine whether the mechanism was a systemic resistance induced by PGPR, a split root technique was employed on greenhouse cucumbers grown in soilless substrates. On the split roots, bacteria which were introduced into one side of the root were completely separated from pathogen challenged-inoculated roots-on the other side of the roots. Results from the series of experiments conducted with this design demonstrated that (i) the resistance against root rot induced by PGPR was systemic, (ii) germination of P. aphanidermatum zoospores was reduced in extracts from bacterized roots compared to non-treated control, and (iii) spread of Pythium mycelia was delayed and zoospore germination was inhibited on the distant induced root, compared to the non-bacterized control. Furthermore, enzyme analysis indicated that phenylalanine ammonia lyase, peroxidase and polyphenoloxidase increased on cucumber roots two days after they were bacterized with Pseudomonas strains 13 or 63--28. When the bacterized roots were challenged with P. aphanidermatum, these plant defense enzymes increased as the symptoms appeared, but this accumulation of enzymes was not any higher on roots induced with each of the Pseudomonas strains compared to the Pythium inoculated control. This enzyme stimulation was also systemically induced by PGPR or P. aphanidermatum on cucumber roots. The patterns of iso-peroxidase induced with the PGPR and P. aphanidermatum treatments were different. High levels of salicylic acid (SA) accumulated in bacteria-induced roots, as well as in pathogen-infected roots, which suggests that SA may be associated with cucumber resistance response. But exogenous application of SA did not induce any systemi</description><creator>Chen, Chunquan, 1958-</creator><contributor>Paulitz, Tim (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Root rots.</subject><subject>Cucumbers -- Diseases and pests -- Biological control.</subject><subject>Pythium aphanidermatum -- Biological control.</subject><subject>Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria.</subject><subject>Cucumbers -- Disease and pest resistance.</subject><title>Induced systemic resistance against Pythium aphanidermatum by plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria on cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p8418p921.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9k41zg25m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Plant Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):34675</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
