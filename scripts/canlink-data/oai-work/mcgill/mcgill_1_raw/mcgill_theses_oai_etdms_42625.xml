It is not a history of Japanese postwar cinema, or a survey of notable directors and genres. Rather, the focus is specifically on film and its relation to the deeper tropes of Japanese society; in particular, on how the sense of nation is affirmed and/or challenged within a postwar period of remarkable change. Understanding such a structure greatly aids in analyzing the forms and meanings within the films. The question of National Cinema, then, is approached by exploring how the interaction of spatial-temporal elements affect both the social construction and filmic practices of the nation. The first part of the dissertation features an extended analysis of Japanese society using a variety of historical, philosophical and theoretical sources, both Japanese and foreign. They provide a theoretical base and a social history that ground the critical readings of the selected films; all of which are well-known and widely available. Part two is a close textual analysis of five 1950s productions---from a range of films and genres---that are contrasted with three films from the late 1980s/early 1990s. The final chapter examines notions about National Cinema in light of the preceding film analysis.</description><creator>Ramlochand, John.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Japan -- Social conditions -- 1945-</subject><subject>Motion pictures -- Japan.</subject><title>Japanese cinema : time space nation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© John Ramlochand, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8336h5873.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s4655m61p</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8336h586t</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We investigate inequalities that can be viewed as generalizations of Hardy's inequality about the Fourier coefficients of a function analytic on the circle. The proof of the Littlewood conjecture opened a wide door in front of questions regarding possible generalizations of Hardy's inequality. The proof of the Littlewood conjecture was based on some constructions of bounded functions having particular properties. In 1993, I. Klemes investigated one of the constructions (we shall call it the algebraic construction) and proved what is called a mixed norm generalization of Hardy's inequality. It turns out that we can work with the same construction and examine more properties of it in order to get more results. The objectives of the thesis are to give more detailed properties of the algebraic construction and to use these properties in order to prove various versions of two-sided Hardy inequalities.</description><creator>Sababheh, Mohammad Suboh.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Mathematics.</subject><title>Constructions of bounded functions related to two-sided Hardy inequalities</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Mohammad Suboh Sababheh, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2b88qh41n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8336h586t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x059cc56q</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Met receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and its ligand, the hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF), which regulate epithelial cell remodelling, dispersal and invasion, are deregulated in many human cancers. In the last twenty years, mechanisms of RTK activation and signalling have been studied extensively. In contrast, very little is known about the mechanisms of down-regulation of RTKs. At the time I began my thesis work, the family of Cbl ubiquitin-protein ligases emerged as negative regulators for RTKs. In this thesis, I demonstrate that c-Cbl is an important negative regulator of the Met receptor. Upon HGF stimulation, c-Cbl promotes ubiquitination of the Met RTK. This requires the association of the c-Cbl tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain with a DpYR binding motif, including Y1003, present in the juxtamembrane of the Met receptor. A Met Y1003F receptor, which lacks the c-Cbl TKB binding site, is not ubiquitinated, transforms fibroblast and epithelial cells in vitro and is tumorigenic in vivo. I demonstrate that ubiquitination of the Met receptor is not required for its internalization from the plasma membrane, but is essential for its lysosomal degradation. In the presence of HGF, the Met Y1003F receptor is poorly degraded and remains phosphorylated, leading to sustained activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway. Moreover, fusion of a ubiquitin moiety to the carboxy-terminus of Met Y1003F is sufficient to decrease Met receptor stability, prevent sustained MEK1/2 activation and reduce cell transformation. To examine the tumorigenicity of the Met Y1003F receptor in animals, I generated a murine model expressing Met Y1003F under the MMTV promoter, and observed that Y1003F substitution increases Met receptor tumorigenicity in mammary glands. This demonstrates for the first time that ubiquitination of a RTK is required for its biological functions in vivo. Furthermore, this highlights synergy between an activating mutation (M1250T) and a loss of down-regulation mutation (Y1003F) in the tumorigenicity of the Met receptor. Based on these results and on the observation that several RTKs escape the lysosomal degradative pathway in human tumours, I propose that loss of RTK down-regulation is a common mechanism for oncogenic activation of RTKs in human tumours.</description><creator>Peschard, Pascal.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>The role of Cbl-mediated ubiquitination in the regulation of the Met receptor tyrosine kinase /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Pascal Peschard, 2005</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xp68km337.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x059cc56q</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9s161b46p</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis investigates the possibility of exploiting haptic force-feedback technology for interacting with virtual musical instruments. A survey of current software solutions for creating haptic virtual environments is provided, with a discussion on the need to integrate such a platform with currently accepted solutions for audio research. A system was developed to combine a haptic programming library with a physical dynamics engine and to expose its functionality through the Open Sound Control (OSC) protocol, an increasingly accepted standard for communication within the audio software and hardware domain. Using OSC messaging, simple 3D objects can be instantiated and constraints on their movement can be specified, allowing the description of physically dynamic mechanisms. Collision events as well as properties of the objects can be transmitted to the audio system continually to be used for modulating audio synthesis parameters. Some examples of simple virtual musical instruments created with the aid of this system are provided.</description><creator>Sinclair, Stephen, 1980-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Musical instruments -- Computer simulation.</subject><subject>Human-computer interaction.</subject><title>Force-feedback hand controllers for musical interaction</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Stephen Sinclair, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wm117t04n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9s161b46p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Schulich School of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:t722hf088</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Despite its enduring popularity in performance circles, Carl Nielsen's Wind Quintet, op. 43 (1922), has received little attention from the scholarly community. This thesis provides the most comprehensive examination of the work to date and includes original analyses of each of the three movements. Moreover, it illuminates and defines stylistic trademarks that are found not only in this piece, but also within Nielsen's oeuvre more broadly. These traits include the weakening of tonal design, the liberal use of chromatic harmonies, contrapuntal writing, and the allusion to and distortion of traditional forms. This thesis highlights Nielsen's synthesis of traditional and idiosyncratic elements and thereby situates his music amid an emerging trend in European compositions of the time: the anachronistic use of historical models (Hyde).</description><creator>Tan, Daphne.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Nielsen, Carl, 1865-1931.

Two tasks are undertaken: the first is to survey the literature that has informed the ongoing evolution of the concept literacy with the specific goal of highlighting recurring themes in an effort to determine what a New Literacy curriculum would look like in practice. The second part of this study is a document analysis of the Secondary English Language Arts (SELA2) Program for Cycle Two students. The analysis attempts to determine the degree to which the SELA2 document has been informed by new theories of literacy stemming from social theory, critical theory, and New Literacy Theory.

Some attempts to define the genre approach it comparatively and systematically---an effort to distinguish the short story from other forms, or to distinguish between different kinds of short fiction. This essay instead proposes a "cluster" of elements that tend to characterize the short story, as derived from the romantic, impressionist, realist, modern, and postmodern traditions. Edgar Allan Poe's notion of "unity of effect" provides a critical standpoint to discuss these features. Poe's concept of unity also partakes in the essay's discussion of the self and the text. Questions of the self are often present in the short story, and the fragmentation of identity often parallels the short story's formal and stylistic fragmentation. The stories in this collection present characters in varying states of crisis, as they negotiate the boundaries of the self, or otherwise question what the "self" means.</description><creator>Klingenberg, Emily.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Self in literature.</subject><title>&amp;quot;Changing faces&amp;quot; : the short story and the crisis of selfhood</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Emily Klingenberg, 2007</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zp38wh73v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6h440x896</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3j3336558</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Ash'arite theology in and after the 7th/13 th century has received little attention in studies of Islamic theology and philosophy. Works like the commentary of the Moroccan ṣufi Aḥmad Zarruq (d. 899/1493) on the creed found in the Iḥya' 'ulum al-din of Abu Ḥadmid al-Ghazali (d. 505/1111) are unknown to historians of Sunni theology. A close analysis of the sources used by Zarruq in his commentary reveals a unique concern with mystical as well as theological subjects. As a result, Zarruq displays an anachronistic preference for early Ash'arite themes while also shying away from involved philosophical discussion which typifies later Ash'arite kalam. Nevertheless, Zarruq's commentary does demonstrate the challenges posed by the two drastically different faces of Ash'arism and how each individual scholar, based on his particular interests and concerns, chose to harmonize these discordant sources.</description><creator>Karimullah, Kamran.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Zarrūq, Aḥmad ibn Aḥmad, d. 1493.</subject><subject>Asharites.</subject><title>Aḥmad Zarrūq and the Ashʻarite school</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Kamran Karimullah, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pz50h159m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3j3336558</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Islamic Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mc87pv61h</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We produce a nonpositively curved square complex, X, containing exactly four squares.

Respiratory motion is known to be the largest intra-fractional organ motion and the most significant source of uncertainty in treatment planning for chest lesions. A method to account for the effects of respiratory motion is to use four-dimensional radiotherapy. While analytical models are useful, it is essential that the motion problem in radiotherapy is addressed by both modeling as well as experimentally studies so that different obstacles can be overcome before clinical implementation of a motion compensation method. Validation of techniques aimed at measuring and minimizing the effects of respiratory motion require a realistic dynamic deformable phantom for use as a gold standard. In this work we present the design, construction, performance and deformable image registration of a novel breathing, tissue equivalent phantom with a deformable lung that can reproducibly emulate 3D non-isotropic lung deformations according to any real lung-like breathing pattern. The phantom consists of a Lucite cylinder filled with water containing a latex balloon stuffed with dampened natural sponges. The balloon is attached to a piston that mimics the human diaphragm. Nylon wires and Lucite beads, emulating vascular and bronchial bifurcations, were glued at various locations, uniformly throughout the sponges. The phantom is capable of simulating programmed irregular breathing patterns with varying periods and amplitudes. A deformable, tissue equivalent tumour, suitable for holding radiochromic film for dose measurements was embedded in the sponge. Experiments for 3D motion assessment, motion reproducibility as well as deformable image registration and validation are presented using the deformable phantom.</description><creator>Margeanu, Monica.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Respiratory Mechanics.</subject><subject>Lung Neoplasms -- radiotherapy.</subject><subject>Lungs -- Cancer -- Radiotherapy.</subject><subject>Radiotherapy, Conformal -- methods.</subject><subject>Radiotherapy Dosage.</subject><subject>Radiation dosimetry.</subject><title>A novel deformable phantom for 4D radiotherapy verification /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Monica Margeanu, 2007</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8049g9138.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m326m6138</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Medical Radiation Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:028711280</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>I here explore the dual roles of gene flow in determining evolutionary and demographic processes in the Misty Lake threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.). In the Misty watershed, the lake fish have streamlined bodies and numerous gill rakers whereas the inlet stream fish have deeper bodies and reduced number of gill rakers, differences that are adaptive for lake and stream environments respectively. The outlet stream population, however, is morphologically intermediate between the lake and inlet populations as a result of high gene flow from the lake preventing adaptation to the stream environment. First, I quantify the constraining effect of gene flow on adaptive divergence in the Misty outlet using two complementary approaches. By comparing phenotypic values and environmental differences between the three habitats (i.e. lake, inlet and outlet), I estimate that the constraint imposed by gene flow on phenotypic divergence is in the order of 80%, i.e. the outlet population only achieves 20% of the phenotypic divergence expected in the absence of gene flow. Parameterization of a quantitative genetic model confirms this value is possible given a biologically realistic range of parameter values. Second, I demonstrate that this constraint imposed by gene flow on adaptation likely contributes to an observed reduction in abundances along the outlet stream. I do so using a transplant experiment and a three-year selection experiment. Quantification of the amount of dispersal suggests that the negative influence of gene flow offsets the positive demographic influence of the immigration of individuals. In summary, gene flow has profound consequences for both evolutionary and demographic processes taking place in the Misty system.</description><creator>Moore, Jean-Sébastien.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Animal population genetics -- British Columbia -- Keogh River Watershed.</subject><subject>Threespine stickleback -- Evolution -- British Columbia -- Keogh River Watershed.</subject><subject>Threespine stickleback -- British Columbia -- Keogh River Watershed -- Molecular genetics.</subject><subject>Gene frequency.</subject><title>The evolutionary and demographic consequences of gene flow in a threespine stickleback population /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Jean-Sébastien Moore, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5t34sp61h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/028711280</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n870zv725</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Osteoporosis is a common condition characterized by bone fragility and fractures. Hip fracture, leads to disability, morbidity, excess mortality and growing costs to health care systems. Antiresorptive agents are used to treat osteoporosis and fractures; it is unknown if these agents are effective in preventing recurrent fractures in individuals who have sustained a hip fracture. Using health services administrative databases, we ascertained the incidence of hip fractures and associated-mortality rates in the elderly population in Quebec, from 1996 to 2002 and, evaluated the effectiveness of antiresorptive agents for the prevention of recurrent hip fractures. We identified 33,243 hip fractures. Age-adjusted annual rates of hip fractures decreased in women by 11% from 1996 to 2002 while they did not change in men. Overall one-year mortality rates were higher in men than in women (37% versus 24%), and remained stable over time. Patients exposed to antiresorptives had a 26% reduction in the rate of recurrent fractures (95% CI, 0.64--0.86) compared to patients who were not exposed to these agents. Hip fractures remain a prevalent disease with serious complications. Further research is essential to confirm our results and, to clarify the association between increasing use of antiresorptive agents and the trend reversal in the incidence of hip fractures.</description><creator>Morin, Suzanne Nicole.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Bone Density Conservation Agents -- therapeutic use.</subject><subject>Hip Fractures -- prevention &amp; control.</subject><subject>Hip Fractures -- drug therapy.</subject><title>Effectiveness of antiresorptive agents for the prevention of recurrent hip factures</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Suzanne Nicole Morin, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/td96k665d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n870zv725</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Occupational Health</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0p096c15j</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The uppermost Cambrian-Lower Ordovician Kamouraska Formation in the external Humber Zone of the Quebec Appalachians consists of dominant thick massive to graded quartz arenite beds, subordinate pebble conglomerate and intercalated thin shale and siltstone beds. It was deposited by hyperconcentrated to concentrated density flows in a meandering submarine canyon on the continental slope bordering the Iapetus Ocean. Turbidity currents deposited beds with turbidite structure divisions. The sandstones consist of well sorted, well rounded quartz sand with frosted grains. Scanning electron microscopy reveals the presence of textures supporting eolian transport before redeposition in the deep sea. The Kamouraska quartz arenites are considered an ancient equivalent of Pleistocene eolian-sand turbidites on an abyssal plain off West Africa consisting of Sahara sand. Sand provenance is attributed to eolian equivalents of the Cairnside Formation of the Potsdam Group. The quartz arenites of the Kamouraska Formation provide a variant to tectonic sandstone provenance proposed in the scheme of Dickinson and Suczek (1979).</description><creator>Malhame, Pierre.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Formations (Geology) -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Geology, Stratigraphic -- Ordovician.</subject><subject>Geology, Stratigraphic -- Cambrian.</subject><subject>Arenites.</subject><title>Quartz arenites of the uppermost Cambrian-lowermost Ordovician Kamouraska Formation, Québec, Canada : gravity flow deposits of eolian sand in the deep sea</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Pierre Malhame, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xp68km35s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0p096c15j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q237hw94c</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Background. In children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), sensori-motor development and functional skills in activities of daily living (ADL) remain little explored in comparison to the other domains of development. Objectives. To determine the impact of sensori-motor skills on functional skills in ADL of preschool children with ASD, and to examine their type of sensory responses, their motor skills and their functional skills in ADL. Methods. This project is a pilot and cross-sectional study. Thirty-five children with ASD, three to four years of age, have been recruited and assessed. Control groups are also included: eight children with developmental delay (DD) and five children with typical development (TD). A battery of diagnostic and clinical tests was used. Results. ASD and DD groups have significantly more atypical sensory responses than the TD group as measured by the Sensory Profile. The ASD group has significantly poorer motor skills than controls (TD and DD) based on the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales --2nd edition (PDMS-2). Self-care skills of the ASD group fall below 2 standard deviations (SD) on the Functional Independence Measure for Children (WeeFIM). Daily living skills (DLS) of the ASD group are significantly poorer than controls on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales -- Second Edition (VABS-II). The largest percentage of variability in self-care skills, as measured by the WeeFIM, is explained by cognitive functioning and auditory processing, while personal skills, as measured by the VABS-II, are predicted by fine motor skills and sensory avoiding. Conclusion. Pre-school children with ASD, but also children with DD, react differently to sensory stimuli than typically developing children. Also, children with ASD have significantly poorer motor skills than DD and TD children. These sensory and motor difficulties affect the functional skills in ADL. Therefore, it will be important clinically to individually assess and consider sensori-motor and functional skills in ADL of children with ASD. Future interventions may then aim at improving and supporting the development and autonomy of these children. In turn this may assist caregivers by reducing their care load.</description><creator>Jasmin, Emmanuelle.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Autistic Disorder.</subject><subject>Motor Skills.</subject><subject>Child, Preschool.</subject><title>Impact of sensory responses and motor skills on functional skills in activities of daily living of pre-school children with autism spectrum disorders</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Emmanuelle Jasmin, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6h440x90z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q237hw94c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Physical and Occupational Therapy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h702qb61p</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this study, we have analyzed the steady-state kinetics of B lymphocytes in mouse and rat bone marrow using previously published experimental data. Over many years, Prof D.G. Osmond and his colleagues have built up a scheme of B cell development in mouse bone marrow based on the sequential expression of markers associated with the B lineage. The earliest precursor B cells comprise three populations of proliferating pro-B cells, i.e. early, intermediate, and late pro-B cells. The subsequent populations comprise pre-B cells that give rise to nondividing B lymphocytes expressing surface IgM. In our analysis, we have checked the available published data for consistency with the proliferation of precursor B cells and their death via apoptosis at certain stages of cell development. We made an extensive summary of the existing data on the various B cell precursors and organized it into a comprehensible framework. We built a mathematical model for the proliferation and differentiation of mammalian B lymphocytes in laboratory mice and rats and estimated all of the parameters to explain the existing steady state data. In this context, mathematical modeling acts as a useful tool to analyze hypotheses and experimental results concerning the steady state numbers of B lymphocytes.</description><creator>Karanfil, Özge.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Models, Theoretical.</subject><subject>B-Lymphocytes.</subject><subject>Lymphopoiesis.</subject><title>A mathematical model of steady state B lymphopoiesis in mouse and rat bone marrow /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Özge Karanfil, 2007</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bc386p779.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h702qb61p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physiology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ns0649955</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Nck is as an adaptor protein previously implicated in actin cytoskeleton reorganization and by our laboratory, in translation and cell response to stress. Our primary objective was to determine the expression levels of Nck isotypes (Nck-1 and Nck-2) during cancer progression. We have performed western blot analysis of the Nck isotypes expression levels profile in various human cancer cell lines, at different stages of progression. Our data show significantly higher expression levels of Nck-2 protein in metastatic melanomas compared to non-metastatic melanomas and normal melanocytes. Using semi-quantitative RT-PCR, we demonstrated that this increase in Nck-2 expression can be also seen at the transcriptional level. The Ras/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway is often spontaneously activated in melanomas causing hyperactivation of ERK. By downregulating the expression of Nck-2 using siRNA, we have established a strong correlation between increased expression levels of Nck-2 and activated ERK. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the involvement of Nck-2 in cell proliferation and adhesion in metastatic melanomas, revealing that Nck-2 acts as a new player in this disease.</description><creator>Ismail, Salma.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Oncogene Proteins.</subject><subject>Melanoma -- genetics.</subject><title>The role of Nck in melanoma progression /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Salma Ismail, 2007</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j6731827b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ns0649955</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physiology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:s4655m637</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The aim was to compare the movements of the mandible during chewing different food types. We hypothesized that the mandibular movements would vary significantly between the food types. For each participant, we built and affixed the dental appliances and attached infra red emitting diodes to record the mandibular movements using a 3D motion capture device (Optotrak). Participants chewed on four test foods that varied in texture: Italian bread stick, dried beef stick, carrot and cheese. Results indicated greater amplitude of the lateral displacement of the mandibular movements when chewing cheese. The velocity of the lateral displacement was greater for soft foods such as cheese. The velocity of the horizontal displacement increased during beef chewing. Furthermore, we found shorter movement cycle duration while chewing carrot. We concluded that the movements of the mandible vary significantly during chewing different food types.</description><creator>Kaur, Navdeep.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Mandible -- physiology.</subject><subject>Mastication -- physiology.</subject><title>Effects of chewing different food types on movements of the mandible</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Navdeep Kaur, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v692tb515.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s4655m637</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Dentistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n296x337g</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Cyclical thrombocytopenia (CT) is a rare hematological disease characterized by periodic oscillations in the platelet count. Although first reported in 1936, the pathogenesis and an effective therapy remain to be identified. Since besides fluctuations in platelet levels the patients hematological profile have been consistently normal, a destabilization of a peripheral control mechanism might play an important role in the genesis of this disorder. In this thesis, we investigate through computer simulations the mechanisms underlying the platelet oscillations observed in CT. First, we collected the data published in the last 40 years and quantified the significance of the platelet fluctuations using Lomb-Scargle periodograms. Our analysis reveals that the incidence of the statistically significant periodic data is equally distributed in men and women. The mathematical model proposed in this thesis captures the essential features of hematopoiesis and successfully duplicates the characteristics of CT. With the same parameter changes, the model is able to fit the platelet counts and to qualitatively reproduce the TPO oscillations (when data is available). Our results indicate that a variation in the megakaryocyte maturity, a slower relative growth rate of megakaryocytes, as well as an increased random destruction of platelets are the critical elements generating the platelet oscillations in CT.</description><description>La thrombocytopénie cyclique (TC) est une rare maladie hématologique caracteriséepar des oscillations périodiques dans les plaquettes sanguines.

Dans cettethèse, nous recherchons à travers des simulations informatiques les mechanismes sousjacentaux oscillations des plaquettes observées dans TC. En premier lieu, nous avonscollecté les données publiées ces 40 dernière années et quantifié l'importance des fluctuationsdes plaquettes en utilisant les périodograms Lomb-Scargle.

Avec les même changementde parametèrs, le modèle reproduit bien le comportement des plaquettes sanguineset donne qualitativement les même oscillations que TPO (quand les données sontdisponibles). Nos résultats indiquent que les éléments critiques générant les oscillationsdes plaquettes dans TC sont une variation dans la maturité du mégakaryocytes,un taux de croissance relativement lent des mégakaryo cytes , ainsi que une augmentationaléatoire de destruction des plaquettes.</description><creator>Apostu, Raluca.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Thrombocytopenia.</subject><subject>Hematopoiesis -- Mathematical models.</subject><title>Understanding cyclical thrombocytopenia : a mathematical modeling approach</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Raluca Apostu, 2007</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2514nq53q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n296x337g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vt150p31f</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Le mycoparasite Stachybotrys elegans est un agent potentiel de lutte biologiquepour le contrôle de Rhizoctonia solani, un phytopathogène causant le chancre dela tige et des stolons chez la pomme de terre (Solanum tuberosum).

The differential expression of two mycoparasitism-induced genes was monitored in S. elegans during interactions with its host, Rhizoctonia solani, and a non-host, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR), comparative analyses demonstrated that hyphal and sclerotial forms triggered different patterns of gene expression in the mycoparasite, as did the presence of the host or non-host. The calmodulin gene did not appear to be involved in conidial germination or appressoria formation of S. elegans. Potential roles of calmodulin during mycoparasitism are suggested, but further studies are required. The expression of the endochitinase-encoding gene, sechi44, was susbstantial only at later stages of interaction with living host sclerotia. Host defense mechanisms probably play a role in regulating sechi44 expression. Knowledge of the genetic mechanisms underlying this mycoparasitic relationship will further our knowledge on the potential use of S. elegans in biocontrol strategies.</description><creator>Arts, Monique R.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Stachybotrys elegans.</subject><subject>Rhizoctonia solani -- Biological control.</subject><title>Gene expression of the mycoparasite Stachybotrys elegans during interaction with a fungal host and a hon-host</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Monique R.

Four such hybrid courts---courts located in Kosovo, East Timor, Cambodia and Sierra Leone, have either just completed their work or are far enough along in their operation to provide a type of "justice laboratory" to test this claim. Analysis reveals that the performance of these courts has been poor. It shows that the courts in Kosovo and East Timor were doomed to failure, that the court in Cambodia is headed in the same direction, and that only the court operating in Sierra Leone offers a possibility that something close to justice will result. The summary recommendation drawn from the analysis is that hybrid courts should only be employed where: (1) international personnel control the proceedings, (2) the legal framework of the court conforms to international standards, and (3) the sponsors of the enterprise possess a clear ability, and demonstrate a credible commitment, to try and punish those most responsible for committing gross human rights offenses.</description><creator>Bowman, Herbert D.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>International criminal courts -- Timor-Leste.</subject><subject>International criminal courts -- Kosovo (Republic).</subject><subject>International criminal courts -- Cambodia.</subject><subject>International criminal courts -- Sierra Leone.</subject><title>Not much justice : the performance of the Internationalized Criminal Courts in Kosovo, East Timor, Cambodia, and Sierra Leone</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Herbert D.

It argues that Godel's Theorem, read through Wittgenstein's understanding of rules and language as a contextual activity, and through Derrida's account of 'undecidability,' offers an alternative account of the relationship of judging to justice. Instead of providing support for the 'indeterminacy' claim, Godel's Theorem illuminates the predicament of undecidability that structures any interpretation and every legal decision, and which constitutes the opening to justice. The first argument in this thesis examines Godel's proof, Wittgenstein's views on rules, and Derrida's undecidability, as manifestations of a common concern with the limits of what can be formalized. The meta-argument examines their misinterpretation and misappropriation within legal theory as a case study of just what they mean about meaning, context, and justice as necessarily co-implicated.</description><creator>Crawley, Karen.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Decidability (Mathematical logic)</subject><subject>Derrida, Jacques.</subject><subject>Judgments -- Philosophy.</subject><subject>Rules (Philosophy)</subject><subject>GÜdel, Kurt.</subject><subject>Law -- Philosophy.</subject><subject>Law -- Interpretation and construction.</subject><subject>GÜdel's theorem.</subject><subject>Wittgenstein, Ludwig, 1889-1951.</subject><title>Limited ink : interpreting and misinterpreting GÜdel's incompleteness theorem in legal theory</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Karen Crawley, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9k41zj782.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c247dx71h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g445cj60h</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:17:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The enforceability and legitimacy of copyright law on the internet have been the subjects of several scholarly works. However, there were few studies that outlined the regulatory models available for the online world with respect to copyright policy. The main thesis of this study is that copyright law can be effectively used and enforced in an electronic environment through co-regulation. The author examines the theoretical underpinnings of copyright and droit d'auteur and argues that a global copyright is now being created. Stemming from this first conclusion, he attempts to show how, worldwide, the means of traditional regulation as well as self-regulation present several shortcomings when confronted with the criteria of legitimacy and enforceability. Rather, it is argued that a third option ought to be considered, one that consists of an effective mix between private and public spheres. Co-regulation appears indeed to address the problems raised by the use of other regulatory models while deferring to copyright policy.</description><creator>Benizri, Yohan-Avner.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Copyright and electronic data processing.</subject><subject>Copyright.</subject><title>Droit d'auteur et co (régulation) : la politique du droit d'auteur sur l'internet</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Yohan-Avner Benizri, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n009w6492.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g445cj60h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):42650</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
