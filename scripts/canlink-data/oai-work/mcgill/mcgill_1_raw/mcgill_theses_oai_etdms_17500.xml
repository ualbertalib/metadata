To eliminate confusion and identify a particular northern portion of the earth, the terms "arctic" and "sub-arctic" were introduced.

The name pernix, meaning lively, as applied to one of the large, grey species that frequent weathered bark and wooden structures is in one sense descriptive of the entire group. Although they seem to spend much time in seclusion under bark scales and in similar places, they are fast runners in the open. Their quick stops and starts, in combination with their flattened, grey or brownish bodies, make these spiders difficult both to find and to collect.</description><creator>Dondale, Charles.

A hundred years of legislation upon hours of work, safety of machines, allotment of labour, cornbination of labour and every other phase of the life of the industrial worker and entrepreneur effectively silence the few voices in the wilderness that still cry freedom. But after that statement is made clarity ceases. Passionate views are held upon every aspect of trade control and there is no field of law in which passion is more out of place. It is not a field of black and white ; of right and wrong; of saints and ogres. Above all it is a field of shifting aims and of striving after an unobtainable ideal.</description><creator>Dobson, Christopher. B.</creator><contributor>Cohen, M.

Niobium was separated from the irradiated material by ion exchange column chromatography. When quick separation of these isotopes was desired a method based on solvent extraction of Niobium was used. A short lived activity, not previously observed, was found in the chemically separated Niobium when zirconium was bombarded at about 40 Mev protons. Gamma rays belonging to this activity were studied on a 28 channel pulse height analyser. Two gamma rays of approximately 75 kev, 1100 kev as well as 511 kev positron annihilation radiation showed a half life of 10 minutes.</description><creator>Din, Ghias ud.</creator><contributor>Foster, J.

First, Service aviation, and I do not think I need define it any more closely than that; secondly, scheduled airline operation which can include some of the long distance passenger charter work, and in the third division, the rest, which is in fact largely made up of aviation in the outback of the great countries of the world. I do not propose to make any further reference to Service aviation, or civil airline operation, or to the development of aircraft for their use because a great many people, far more qualified than I am, have covered those subjects in very great detail.</description><creator>Dillon, Joseph.

At the same time, it serves as an illustration of a method of multiple survey through the use of aerial photographs. The area of Northern Ontario which is "re-explored" is the roughly 93,903 square miles encompassed by the Albany River Sheet (No. 2220) of the World Aeronautical Chart Series, published at a scale of 1 to 1 million (Map 1, in pocket). There were three principal reasons for selecting this particular area. One is that it is contiguous to Northern Quebec where similar studies have been made by research groups in the Geography Department of McGill University.</description><creator>Dean, William.

Shannon in 1948 (ref.60) and by B. Mandelbrot in 1952 (ref.39). Information theory, now a branch of mathematical probability, was originally introduced by communications engineers. Thus, in the papers of Shannon and Mandelbrot analogies between the applications to physics and the applications to linguistics are frequently stressed. Fortunately, information theory bas very recently been developed on a purely mathematical basis. Thus, in this thesis references to physical analogies will be made only where they seem to clarify the situation.</description><creator>Dawson, Donald. A.</creator><contributor>Lambek, J.

Of the 12 items on the questionnaire, the first 8 enlisted information relevant to the respondent's age, husband's age, duration of the marriage, previous marriage if any, number of children, length of acquaintance prior to the marriage, husband's occupation, and wife's occupation if she was working outside the home. The remaining 4 items requested the respondent to state the qualities she liked most in her husband, those she disliked most, whether she would marry him again, and, finally, to state reasons why she would or would not.</description><creator>Davison, Daintry.</creator><creator>Gerhardt, Aleida.</creator><creator>McGibbon, Joan.</creator><creator>Segal, Constance.</creator><creator>Watts, June.</creator><creator>Zukerman, Norma.</creator><contributor>Ross, V.

Where underground pillars are used, the determination of suitable sizes present a problem about which little is known. An attempt has been made to gain an understanding of the factors involved in this problem by reviewing both theoretical and practical information on the subject. With this at hand, an attempt has been made to analyse pillar designs used in the Elliot Lake Uranium District, Ontario.</description><creator>Davies, John. J.</creator><contributor>Morrison, R.

It is characterized by the occurrence of massive albuminuria, hypoproteinemia, hyperlipemia and voluminous edema. When this syndrome is almost pure, that is to say, when it is not accompanied by hematuria, renal insufficiency or hypertension, it has for a long time been referred to as lipuid nephrosis. The German anatomists (MUNK, 1908; VOLLARD AND FAHR 1913) were the first to use this name arising from the observation that the renal tubules are infiltrated by birefringent liquid substances accompanied by signs of inflammation.</description><creator>Das Gupta, Dyutish.
