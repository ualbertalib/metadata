It is responsible for modification of low density lipoprotein (LDL), injury to endothelial cells and has been reported to alter prostacyclin synthesis. We therefore investigated lipid peroxidation in human LDL and in LDL and aortae from rabbits fed cholesterol-supplemented diets. We also studied the correlation between lipid peroxidation and prostanoid production in vivo and in vitro. Unsaturated fatty acids in human LDL are oxidized to their monohydroxy derivatives during the incubation with CuSO$ sb4$ and endothelial cells. Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis of monohydroxy fatty acids revealed a similar mechanism of peroxidation of LDL lipids by endothelial cells as that by CuSO$ sb4,$ i.e., autooxidation of LDL lipids. Increased amounts of monohydroxy fatty acids in LDL and aorta were observed in rabbits fed cholesterol-supplemented diets. The increased amounts of monohydroxy derivatives of oleic and linoleic acids, but not those of arachidonic acid, were due to the increased amounts of their fatty acid precursors. The increased amounts of aortic monohydroxy derivatives of arachidonic acid, but not those of oleic and linoleic acids, were positively correlated with the severity of the atherosclerotic lesions. Prostacyclin production by aortae was slightly increased after cholesterol-supplemental diets despite evidence for increased lipid peroxidation in this tissue. This may be because esterified hydroperoxy fatty acids in aorta are not very effective in inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. In contrast to the moderate changes in aortic PGI$ sb2$ synthesis, there was a dramatic increase in the synthesis of thromboxane B$ sb2$ by aortae from hypercholesterolemic rabbits, suggesting a role for thromboxane A$ sb2$ in atherogenesis.</description><creator>Wang, Tao, 1958-</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><title>Prostaglandins and lipid peroxidation products in atherosclerosis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qb98mg284.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b2773w43v</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:br86b423c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:52:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The role played by a parathyroid hormone-like peptide (PLP) in the pathogenesis of hypercalcemia associated with malignancy has been examined. Elevated circulating levels of PLP were found more frequently in hypercalcemic cancer patients. A reduction of tumor burden in two of these patients resulted in concomitant decreases in both plasma calcium and plasma PLP. Immunoneutralization of endogenous PLP in a rat model of malignancy associated hypercalcemia resulted in a rapid and sustained reversal of the biochemical abnormalities manifest in the disease state. These studies, therefore, provided strong evidence for a role for PLP in the pathogenesis of hypercalcemia associated with neoplasia. The frequent association of squamous cell carcinoma with hypercalcemia and elevated circulating PLP levels prompted examination of a keratinocyte model of tumor progression for evidence of dysregulated PLP expression. Increased constitutive production of PLP, accompanied by resistance to previously identified regulatory agents, was demonstrated in the progression to the malignant phenotype. Finally, a potential autocrine or paracrine role for PLP in keratinocyte cell growth was suggested by the demonstration of functional adenylate cyclase-linked PLP receptors on an established keratinocyte cell line. These studies have therefore provided important insights into the role played by PLP as both an endocrine factor involved in the pathogenesis of malignancy associated hypercalcemia and as a potential autocrine/paracrine factor in keratinocyte homeostasis.</description><creator>Henderson, Janet</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><title>Examination of the distribution and biological action of a parathyroid hormone-like peptide (PLP) associated with the hypercalcemia of malignancy</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2r36tz336.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/br86b423c</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:00000082g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:52:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The present work was aimed at studying the release of arachidonic acid and formation of lipoxygenase metabolites in rat brain slices maintained in vitro, as well as exploring possible physiological roles for them in the mammalian central nervous system. A particularly active 12-(S)-lipoxygenase activity was found, which could be stimulated by various stimuli including the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and glutamate. Activation of $ alpha$-adrenergic and N-methyl- scD-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subtypes appear responsible for the effect observed in each case. Arachidonic acid on the other hand was found to have profound effects on synaptic transmission, inducing a long-lasting potentiation which appears dependent on the formation of lipoxygenase metabolites. In return, pharmacological conditions which can potentially lead to long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission and for most of them activate NMDA receptors also induced arachidonic acid release. As these observations suggest, it is proposed that arachidonic acid and its lipoxygenase metabolites belong to a new group of messengers in the nervous system possibly acting as modulator of synaptic transmission both intra- and transcellularly. This new class of messengers constitutes an essential component of the molecular machinery involved in synaptic plasticity.</description><creator>Pellerin, Luc</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><title>Studies on arachidonic acid release and metabolism by the 12-lipoxygenase pathway in rat brain slices</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x920fx555.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/00000082g</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:v405sb04z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:52:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this study was the assessment of physics reasoning on the basis of students' understanding of motion on an inclined plane. Subjects were presented with a video tape showing a motion experiment in steps and were asked to formulate hypotheses and design an experiment to test these. Subjects thought aloud while specifying the designs and goals of an experiment. Protocols were analyzed by an original method using schema representation techniques. Adequancy of subjects' reasoning was evaluated by comparison to a composite model built from physics domain principles. As more information was presented to subjects, processing differences were observed. Using a hierarchy of processes from recognition to generation, five groups of subjects were defined. Subjects differed in recognition and inclusion processes, use of incoming information, ability to generate experimental designs, and responses to falsification. Concepts of average velocity and differences in directionality of reasoning were analyzed.</description><creator>Leesinsky, Peter</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Reasoning (Psychology)</subject><subject>Physics -- Study and teaching</subject><title>Student designs of experiments as indicators of physics reasoning</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/73666524j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v405sb04z</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2j62s564m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:52:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The effects of irradiation dose (0, 0.5 and 1.0 kGy), various gas atmospheres and storage temperature (5, 15 and 25$ sp circ$C) on the physical, chemical, microbiological, and organoleptic changes in fresh pork were studied using factorial design experiments. The effects on toxin production by Clostridium botulinum were also investigated using challenge studies. Shelf life could be extended to 21 d when product was packaged in 0% O$ sb2$, irradiated at 1.0 kGy and stored at 5$ sp circ$C compared to 4 d for control samples. While the presence of O$ sb2$ in the package headspace enhanced the antimicrobial effects of low-dose irradiation, it adversely affected the organoleptic qualities of pork. Botulinum toxin was detected after only 2 d in all inoculated treatments stored at 25$ sp circ$C. At 15$ sp circ$C, toxin was produced faster when pork was initially packaged with O$ sb2$ or low levels of CO$ sb2$ (15-30%) as compared to 100% N$ sb2$. Higher levels of CO$ sb2$ (45-75%) delayed toxin production. In most treatments, spoilage preceded toxigenesis. Models were developed relating the above factors to the time until toxin production and to the probability of toxigenesis.

Existing documentation, content analysis of the Greek community press, and participant observation were all used in unfolding the school's historical development. The dependent variables of Greekness, adjustment and achievement were examined via the interviewing of 549 Greek origin individuals, 118 of whom were adults, 255 Socrates students, 158 non-Socrates students, and the rest 18 were Socrates graduates. Although the results obtained did not provide conclusive evidence concerning an assumed differential impact of Socrates along the variables investigated, the ethnic identity influences of the community school were clearly delineated. At the same time, the results of the study have pointed to what has been coined here a "Socrates ethos" which is may be conducive to academic and socio-professional success. Accordingly, an overall long-term Socrates impact has tentatively been postulated.</description><creator>Bombas, Leonidas C.</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Ethnicity -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><subject>Ecole primaire Socrate (Montréal, Québec)</subject><subject>Academic achievement -- Quebec (Province) -- Montreal.</subject><subject>Ethnic schools -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><title>The Greek day school Socrates in Montreal : its development and impact on student identity, adjustment and achievement</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6d56zx37f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8k71nh850</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n583xv818</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:52:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Dialogue is a written text representing an oral exchange between two or more persons; it also includes catechisms and rhetorically formulated series of queries and responses presenting an argument.

Because we are interested in sequence analysis, algorithms for training recurrent networks are studied and an original algorithm for constrained recurrent networks is proposed and test results are reported. We also discuss the integration of connectionist models with other analysis tools that have been shown to be useful for sequences, such as dynamic programming and hidden Markov models. We introduce an original algorithm to perform global optimization of a neural network/hidden Markov model hybrid, and show how to perform such a global optimization on all the parameters of the system.

Six strains of Lb. casei (ssp. casei, ssp. rhamnosus, and ssp. pseudoplantarum), selected from superior peptidase and esterase-lipase profiles, were further studied for their amino-, di-, and carboxy-peptidase activities using thirty synthetic substrates. This study revealed useful information towards improving our understanding of the peptidase profiles and probable role of Lb. casei in Cheddar cheese ripening. Although individual strains varied in their specific activities against different substrates, Lactobacillus subspecies generally exhibited high amino- and di-peptidase, relatively weak tripeptidase, but no carboxypeptidase activities. The knowledge gained from these studies helped us selecting two strains (Lb. casei ssp. casei LLG and Lb. casei ssp. rhamnosus S93) with highest amino- and di-peptidase activities for further research. In order to study their enzymatic characteristics and kinetics, aminopeptidase of these two strains were purified to homogeneity by Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC). A single monomeric enzyme was shown to be responsible for the entire aminopeptidase activity of the cell-free extracts. This investigation provided new insights and revealed fundamental knowledge about the peptidases of Lb. casei group. In addition, new methodologies were developed for rapid enzyme purification using FPLC system, and evaluation of peptidases by API ZYM enzyme system.</description><creator>Arora, Gulshan</creator><contributor>Lee, Byong H.

The method presented here is based on the natural orthogonal complement (NOC) of the kinematic constraint matrix associated with the linear homogeneous form of the kinematic constraints. The method of the NOC is used to model mechanical systems consisting of multiple-loop kinematic chains with nonholonomic constraints. Moreover, the method of the NOC, when coupled with an optimization technique, can be used for the feedforward control of redundantly actuated systems, as shown here. The method of the NOC is first discussed in detail with the aid of an example of a two-wheeled mechanical system. Then, nonholonomic robotic mechanical systems, for example, automatic guided vehicles (AGVs), are analysed for simulation purposes. As a result, general-purpose software is developed for the kinematic and dynamic analyses of three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) AGVs. These AGVs use omnidirectional wheels which, in contrast to conventional wheels, e.g., the wheels in an automobile, result in 3-DOF motion of the vehicle. Isotropic designs of 3-DOF AGVs for direct kinematics are proposed, which should enhance the control of the vehicle. With advanced computer graphics, a common trend is to use motion animation in assessing the time response of the systems under study. This brought about issues of algorithmic complexity that are inherent to motion animation. These issues are addressed with an example involving the attitude representation of a rigid body and the choice of a suitable coordinate frame in representing the dynamic equations of motion.</description><creator>Saha, Subir Kumar</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Dynamics and design of nonholonomic robotic mechanical systems</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3n203z95g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b2773w444</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:08612p43k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:52:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Four types of dolomites occur in the Middle Devonian Presqu'ile barrier: fine-crystalline, medium-crystalline, coarse-crystalline, and saddle. Fine-crystalline dolomite formed penecontemporaneously by Middle Devonian seawater, because it is interbedded with Muskeg anhydrite in the back-barrier facies, and has O and Sr isotopic values of Middle Devonian seawater signatures. Medium-crystalline dolomite is interpreted to have formed: (1) at shallow burial depths by fluids derived from compaction, as indicated by its depleted $ delta sp{18}$O values and slightly radiogenic $ sp{87}$Sr/$ sp{86}$Sr ratios; or (2) soon after deposition by Middle Devonian seawater derived from the Elk Point basin, as suggested by its spatial distribution. Coarse-crystalline and saddle dolomites formed after sub-Watt Mountain exposure during burial. The homogenization temperatures of saddle dolomite fluid inclusions indicate that dolomitization occurred at temperatures exceeding maximum burial temperatures. The gradual decrease in Sr isotopes and homogenization temperatures with corresponding increase in O isotopes eastward along the Presqu'ile barrier suggests the basin-scale migration of hot and radiogenic dolomitizing fluids updip from west to east along the Presqu'ile barrier. Fluid movement probably was most active during Late Cretaceous and early Tertiary mountain building in conjunction with a gravity-driven flow system caused by uplift of the foreland basin. The Pine Point MVT deposits also occurred at this time since they overlapped with saddle dolomites. Extensive hydrothermal dissolution of carbonates preceded and overlapped with saddle dolomites.</description><creator>Qing, Hairuo</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Geology.</subject><title>Diagenesis of middle devonian presqu'ile dolomite pine point NWT and adjacent subsurface</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/47429b02g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/08612p43k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geological Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cz30pt575</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:52:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Over the past decade, the theoretical basis for composition research and pedagogy has expanded. A social perspective on writing has been added to the cognitive view which dominated composition studies throughout the 1970s and early 80s. This social perspective has radically altered conceptions of the writing process. Whereas cognitive theory placed a creative and isolated individual at the centre of the writing act, social theory locates the writer in community, and shifts much of the control of discourse from the individual to the group. This research takes the form of a case study of social workers attached to Quebec's Youth Court system. The specific focus within that setting is the preparation of reports about adolescents in trouble with the law. Data were collected through "think-aloud" protocols and interviews, including discourse-based interviews. The study offers a detailed description of the complex and dynamic relationship between the individual writer and the community, and provides a new perspective on the concept of "audience" and the notion of genre as social action.</description><creator>Paré, Anthony.</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Social workers</subject><subject>Composition (Language arts) -- Social

In addition, the behaviour of sodium during the pyrolysis of black liquor and the presence of adsorbed elemental sodium in pyrolysis char were investigated. Using the single droplet apparatus and the procedures developed, true gas formation rate data were determined under conditions simulating those in kraft recovery processes. The mass spectrometer allowed the formation rates of several compounds to be determined simultaneously. All major permanent, hydrocarbon, and sulphurous pyrolysis gases, with the exception of H$ sb2$, were determined, along with pyrolysis char and tar yields. The rate data reveal that sulphurous gas formation occurs relatively early as compared to that of the other gases determined. The data also reveal that pyrolysis gases are formed during droplet drying. While CH$ sb3$SH and CH$ sb3$SCH$ sb3$ yields decrease sharply with temperature, and those of H$ sb2$S and CH$ sb2$SSCH$ sb3$ remain quite constant, the CS$ sb2$ formation increases to a significant level at 900$ sp circ$C. The yields of ethane and methanol also decrease sharply with temperature, but those for ethylene, methane, CO, and CO$ sb2$ correspondingly increase. Acetylene yields become measurable at 900$ sp circ$C. While the influence of gas atmosphere on the sulphur release during pyrolysis is small, the influence on hydrocarbon gas yields is significant. The presence of adsorbed elemental sodium in black liquor pyrolysis chars was found to be responsible for the pyrophoric nature of some chars. This reduced sodium reacts with water to produce hydrogen. In a recovery boiler, sufficient hydrogen could be formed to produce an explosive mixture above the char bed, which upon detonation could trigger a smelt-water explosion.
