Lemoine (58), in 1895, found streptococci alone in 93 cases when examining the mucus from 117 throats in scarlet fever, while 14 cases had streptococci in association with other organisms. The absence ot streptococci in only 5 of 701 scarlet fever patients was reported by Baginsky and Sommerfeld (3), while Ruediger (88), examining 75 throats of patients ill with this disease, found that 64 showed streptococci alone, with pneumococci and streptococci occurring together in 10 cases.</description><creator>Cahn, Shirley.</creator><contributor>Murray, E.G.D.

The economist observes that farm labour is being inefficiently employed on many Canadian farms, and points out the necessity for migration of labour from the farms to other industries where the productivity of labour is greater and can command a higher award. Thus it is quite rational to ask why further growth of the Canadian farm population should be encouraged by an extensive government sponsored scheme for veteran settlement?

While dealing with a certain philosophical doctrine, we may put the main emphasis on tracing its sources and comparing the doctrine with others known in the history of philosophy. On the other hand, it is possible to direct our attention mainly towards a critical analysis of the notions and propositions on which this philosophy is based, and to examine them without being much interested in the historical aspect of the problem.</description><creator>Moser, S.</creator><date>1952</date><subject></subject><subject>Philosophy.</subject><title>Ernst Mach and the Vienna Circle : an examination of their basic concepts.</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t148fn156.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/37720h87j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Philosophy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:37720h88t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T21:13:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Concept of Purpose in Kant's Philosophy is an attempt to feature a phase of Kant's philosophical thought that has received relatively scant attention.

The discovery of the steroid hormones and the realization of their wide physiological significance, however, diverted the attention of most workers in the field to the study of those steroids possessing endocrine activity. Only cholesterol, by virtue of the abundance of this sterol in all mammalian tissues and its importance in pathological conditions, continued to be investigated.

Aside from the introduction the dissertation is divided into three major chapters corresponding to these three aspects. Ibn Bajjah's theory of the original time of motion and his contributions to the development of the science of physics in his attempt to build a unified theory of motion are explained in the first chapter. His theory of knowledge and his attempt to describe the philosopher's ascent en route to conjunction with the Intellect are explained in Chapter two. His concern with the Prime Mover is shown in Chapter three. Finally, the text of Ibn Bajjah's Commentary on the Physics (al-Sama' al-tabi'i) of Aristotle is edited here for the first time and is added to the dissertation as an appendix.</description><creator>Ziyadah, Ma'an.</creator><date>1972</date><subject>Islamic Studies.</subject><subject></subject><title>the Theory of Motion in Ibn Bajjah's Philosophy.</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8336h568w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5t34sp365</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Islamic Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6m311t45c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T21:13:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is divided into three main parts.

Selon le dogme shi'ite, l'imamah a une fonction importante car il est une expression de la Grace (lutf) de Dieu envers sa création. Selon le principe de la Justice ('adl) de Dieu, les théologiens du Shi'isme duodécimain ont developpé des arguments religieux afin ge soutenir ce dogme. Un aspect de la justice divine est que Dieu ne commet pas d'injustice et ne punit son serviteur sans raison valable. Par consequent, ce principe rend necessaire pour Lui d'imposer des obligation religieuses (taklifs) afin que son serviteur les observent.

On the basis of the principle of God's Justice ('adl), Twelver-Shi'i theologians developed theological arguments to support this dogma. One aspect of God's Justice is that He will not do injustice or punish His servants without valid reason. Consequently this principle makes it necessary for God to lay Religious Obligations (taklifs) upon His servants to be observed.
