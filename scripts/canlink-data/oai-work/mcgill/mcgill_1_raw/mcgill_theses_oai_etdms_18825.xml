Lord Monck, in the speech from the Throne to the first Canadian Parliament, on November 7, 1867, said: “I congratulate you on the legislative sanction which has been given by the Imperial Parliament to the Act of Union, under the provision of which we are now assembled and which has laid the foundation of a new nationality that l trust and believe will, ere long, extend its bounds from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean.”</description><creator>Piscopo, Franco.

The passage of three and a half centuries has not brought about the fulfilment of Jonson’s prophecy, but it has inevitably added to the difficulty of understanding Donne's poetry. Many of the scientific ideas which underlie a great field of his poetic imagery, and much of the Elizabethan Medicine to which he constantly referred, have now been forgotten. A study of them is rewarded by fresh insight into his meaning.</description><creator>Pickup, T.</creator><contributor>Malloch, A.

When this disturbance in growth involves one or all of the bones in the lower extremities, its results are particularly distressing. The difference in length of the lower extremities, even though otherwise normal, produces a limp and a pelvic obliquity with a compensatory scoliosis of the spine. We can dismiss the problem of a discrepancy in the upper limbs as there is no functional disability from a pure difference in length. A discrepancy in the weight-bearing lower limbs is, however, far more serious.</description><creator>Percy, Edward. C.</creator><contributor>Webster, D.

Ever since this discovery, the investigation of similar free radicals containing unpaired electrons has played an increasingly important part in the formal development of chemical kinetics and especially in the elucidation of complex reaction mechanisms. Prior to the suggestion that free alkyl radicals might be involved in the mechanisms of thermal and photochemical reactions of simple organic molecules, the role of free atoms in chemical mechanisms was firmly established.</description><creator>Onyszchuk, Mario.</creator><contributor>Winkler, C.

The first steroid hormone to be isolated in pure state was estrone in 1929. Within a short period of time the various sex hormones, estrogens, androgens and progestins were isolated, characterized and synthesized. The compounds elaborated by the adrenal cortex were the last type of steroid hormones to be investigated. Experiments initiated in 1935 led to the isolation and characterization of twenty-eight crystalline steroids, six of which exhibit activity in prolonging the life of adrenalectomized animals.</description><creator>O’Donnell, Vincent.

The older picture, based on the anatomical findings of Cajal and on the Sherrington reflex, was that signals from the receptors made their way to the cortex via the well-defined sensory pathways, were then sorted out as by an immense switchboard, and if they had a clear route continued through to the motor system. The problem of learning was to discover the laws whereby the connections of the hypothetical switchboard became changed.</description><creator>Milner, P.M.</creator><contributor>Smith, Charles J.

This maxim found its classic exposition in the memorandum penned by Lord Salisbury on May 29, 1901, in support of his contention that the country should remain free of the continental alliance system.

Entre cette date et celle de sa mort, il écrivit vingt-six contes et romans. Candide fut publié en 1759, alors que Voltaire, à soixante-quatre ans, avait conquis une réputation universelle et une influence considérable, grâce à ses oeuvres littéraires et à sa prodigieuse correspondance. Candide est une des missives lancées de Ferney, destinée à combattre l'optimisme vague des disciples de Leibnitz et à ridiculiser Rousseau et sa thèse que l'homme est foncièrement bon et la civilisation mauvaise.

Sols of cellulose particles in distilled water were prepared and partially fractionated by centrifuging. Extinction angle measurements, with an estimated experimental error of +/- 1°, were made on these sols. The particle length distribution of one of the sols was determined from electron microscope measurements. An extinction angle vs. velocity gradient curve was calculated, for this distribution, using the Peterlin and Stuart theory for the orientation of rigid ellipsoids in conjunction with the Sadron theory for polydisperse systems. This curve fits the experimentally determined extinction angle data within the limits of experimental error.</description><creator>MacLennan, Donald Fraser.</creator><contributor>Mason, S.G.

More recently, attempts have been made to establish "critical levels" of the mineral elements necessary for normal crop growth in various organs of the plants themselves. Both of these procedures have met with some degree of success, but much work remains to be done in standardizing the methods, particularly those of the latter group, against field performance.
