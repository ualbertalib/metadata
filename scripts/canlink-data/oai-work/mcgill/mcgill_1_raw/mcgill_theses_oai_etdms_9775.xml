By epileptic discharge is implied the excessive, violent discharge of certain portions of the central nervous system which is responsible for many if not all of the manifestations of epileptiform fits and epilepsy. [...] Since there are now at least four reliable indices of the epileptic discharge, as will be pointed out later, the spread of the discharge can be followed with considerable accuracy. An analysis of the manner in which the epileptic discharge spreads should throw light on its nature, particularly on the neurological mechanisms involved. I believe that physiochemical studies in epilepsy have much to offer in determining the nature of epilepsy and may ultimately furnish the more fundamental explanation. But a study of the neurologic mechanisms also has much to offer both in explaining clinical manifestations and in pointing the way to further research in this field. There is a great need for productive hypotheses based on sound physiological principles and for synthesis of the facts which are available about epilepsy.

It is well known that these substances play an important role in plant life and plant products. During this period the development of processes for the isolation of cellulose from different trees and grasses has led to the simultaneous production of huge quantities of lignin substances, the world production running into many millions of pounds. The utilization in industry of this lignin component of the plant has heretofore met with only slight success. The reason for this lack of application must be attributed to lack of information concerning its chemical structure. Previous experimental work on lignin has led to a great variety of speculations concerning its composition as well as to numerous methods for extracting it from plant materials. The work presented in this thesis gives new information concerning the structure of lignin materials obtained from spruce wood by ethanolysis.

The method of mixtures was chosen as being the most generally convenient and readily applicable of calorimetric methods.[...] The greater portion of the time spent on this research was given to the development of the calorimeter. A large number of tests were made on the apparatus in its progressive stages of development and assembly in order to determine the characteristics of the calorimeter and the optimum conditions for its operation. In its present form, as described in this thesis, it is capable of a very high degree of accuracy. By the unique use of a vacuum in the design, most of the common sources of error in calorimetric investigations have been eliminated. Great interest has been shown in the isotopes of hydrogen, and their compounds, since their discovery in 1932. Hence, as an application of the calorimetric method developed in this thesis, the specific heats of deuterium oxide have been measured over the range 25°C to 90°C. The results are compared with the specific heats of water in the same temperature range and their theoretical significance is discussed.

Under the aegis of the Department of Sociology at McGill University, studies of the West have dealt with the process of pioneer settlement which has played such an important part in determining the characteristics of Canada*s social structure. Graduate students have written a number of theses dealing with the cultural adjustment of immigrant groups in our large cities. The Social Research Department at McGill has conducted extensive studies of employment and unemployment in Montreal, and of industrial and agricultural development in Eastern Canada. Following such studies attention is now turning toward the natural regions which go to make up the larger Canadian scene. Initial work has been done by the Social Research department in delineating the boundaries of the various natural regions within the Provinces of Quebec and Ontario. The object of this thesis is to analyze in detail the ecological and social processes at work in one of the Quebec regions: the Eastern Townships.

Lorsque les partisans enragés de l'Union cherchaient à faire entrer dans un même moule les deux génies, anglo-saxon et français, dont le Canada se compose, les Canadiens français s'insurgèrent contre l'absorption brutale.

Environmental factors are controlled within limits by the livestock man. Nutritional and physiological factors are interdependent in regard to milk production, and thus the extent to which production can be increased, through liberal feeding practises, is limited. Turner (1936) has discussed in detail the factors affecting milk secretion, grouped as nutritional, physiological and managerial. A comparatively recent development in the study of lactation is the discovery of the physiological action of the endocrine glands. A large amount of work in this field has been carried on in the past few years and although the information is by no means complete, certain definite findings have aided materially in understanding the phenomenon of milk secretion. It has been shown that the development of the mammary gland and the initiation of lactation are each dependent on specific endocrine glands. Research has also indicated that these functions are not independent but are interrelated with other physiological processes in the body such as estrus, pregnancy, and parturition, which are likewise stimulated by gland secretions transported through the blood stream.</description><creator>Logan, Vaughn Stewart, 1906-</creator><contributor>Crampton, E.

In first developing the cyclotron, Lawrence chose to ionize the gas by electron bombardment which method is used in the majority of cyclotrons now in existence. A flat spiral filament one-half inch in diameter was mounted in the centre of the cyclotron chamber directly above the diametral gap in the dees and kept at 1000 volts negative with respect to its water cooled shield and the walls. The gas to be ionized, in this case, hydrogen, filled the chamber at a pressure of 10^-4 mm Hg and the pressure of other gases in the chamber was kept below 10^-5 mm Hg. The electrons emitted by the filament were accelerated by the 1000 volt electric field and passed down the vertical lines of force of the cyclotron magnet, ionizing the gas molecules in their paths. The resulting electron and positive ion current amounted to 100 ma. It is difficult to produce,by this means, a large electron current because of the electron space charge about the filament.

The yields were recorded by weight, and analysed by the analysis of variance. Nitrogen, phosphorus and potash all gave very significant increases over the nil treatment. Doubling the phosphorus and potash in the basic treatment resulted in further increments in yield. Celery was grown in quartz sand in the greenhouse and nutrients approximating the fertilizers used in the field were applied as nutrient solutions. The effect of nitrogen, phosphorus and potash on the growth of tops and roots and on the number of leaves is discussed together with top/root ratios. The basic treatment gave the tallest plants. The basic treatment with an additional 16 per cent of potash gave the greatest weight of tops as well as the greatest weight of roots. Potash did not influence either the weight or the length of roots. [...]</description><creator>Ounsworth, Leslie Frank.</creator><contributor>Murray, H.

The arrangements are such that the lags occurring after a change in temperature in the critical region can be followed, and their effect as an error in the heat capacity measurement eliminated. A very efficient low temperature fractionating unit has been constructed, in order to assure the purity of the material used. The heat capacity of ethylene has been determined for three fillings near the critical density, and for a fourth filling somewhat removed from this value. These are the first heat measurements made on ethylene in the critical range, and the first measurements made on any material, in which the time lags which occur near the critical temperature are taken into account, and their effect as an error in the heat capacity measurement eliminated.

Güssow) characterized by the formation of raised, level or depressed corky lesions upon the surface of the potato tuber, is a well known disease of potatoes. It is also of common knowledge today that potato scab is caused by the organism Actinomyces scabies. The scab organism may be present in the soil or may be introduced into uncontaminated soil by the use of scabby tubers. To-day, this disease occurs in practically every part of the world where the potato is grown. This widespread disease of potato is considered very serious in the United States and Canada, where it produces great losses by reducing both the quality and yield of tubers. Owing to the fact that only traces of scab precludes seed potato certification and that the production of certified seed potatoes is very important in Canada, this problem is of considerable economic importance. The problem of potato scab is one of extreme importance in the Montreal district, and has been studied for four years, with the financial assistance of the Horticulture Department of Quebec and under the direction of Professor J.G. Coulson. Experiments have been carried out at Ile Jesus and in Napierville county. Studies have been made for the purpose of testing the effectiveness of certain chemicals, chiefly mercurial compounds, when applied to the soil,in controlling common scab of potatoes in mineral and muck soils, and to determine the soil factors influencing their effectiveness.</description><creator>Généreux, Georges Henri.</creator><contributor>Coulson, J.

Limitations of the coalfield come under two main heads: a. Areal extent of the undersea coalfield. b. The distance from shore at which coal can be mined at a cost of production permitting its profitable sale. Conclusions reached are that the areal extent of seams below the Phalen Seam is of small economic importance, and that non-persistence of these seams in full thickness and quality in the undersea extension of the coalfield, will put an end to profitable mining before any limitations connected with distance from the shoreline become operative.
