In order to follow changes in early morphology and the onset of synaptic activity in the same identified neuron, whole cell patch clamp recordings and fluorescent dye fills were obtained from dorsal pressure-sensitive (P) cells, the first neurons that could be reliably identified in the early embryo. I followed the development of the P cell from the first extension of neurites to the elaboration of an adult-like arbour. Following the growth of primary neurites, we observed a profuse outgrowth of transient neurites within the neuropil that retracted to form spurs. Following a dormant period, stable secondary branches grew from the spurs and became tipped with terminals. At this time, neurites of the Retzius (R) cell, a known presynaptic partner in the adult, were observed to contact the terminals. Although voltage-dependent currents were seen in the P cell at the earliest stage, spontaneous synaptic activity was only observed when terminals had formed. Spontaneous release was observed before evoked release could be detected from the R cell. The results suggest that transient neurites are formed during an exploratory phase of development, whereas the more precisely timed outgrowth of stable neurites from the spurs signals functional differentiation during synaptogenesis. As spurs have also been observed in neurons of the mammalian brain, they may constitute a primordial synaptic organizer.</description><creator>Reese, David R.</creator><contributor>Drapeau, Pierre (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Leeches -- Physiology.</subject><subject>Synapses.</subject><subject>Neurons -- Growth.</subject><title>Neuropilar synaptogenesis between identified central neurons in vivo</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2f75r9885.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5d86p249z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k930c044g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:19:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Thus far, cellular automata have been used primarily to model the systems consisting of a number of elements which interact with one another only locally; in addition these interactions can be naturally modeled with a discrete type of computation. In this thesis, we will investigate the possibility of a cellular automata application to a problem involving continuous computations, in particular, a problem of continuous function identification from a set of examples. A fuzzy model of cellular automata is introduced and used throughout the study. Two main issues in the context of this application are addressed: representation of real values on a cellular automata structure and a technique which provides cellular automata with a capacity for learning. An algorithm for encoding real values into cellular automata state configurations and a gradient descent type learning algorithm for fuzzy cellular automata are proposed in this thesis. A fuzzy cellular automaton learning system was implemented in a software and its performance studied by means of the experiments. The effects of several system's parameters on its performance were examined. Fuzzy cellular automata demonstrated the capabilities of carrying out complex continuous computations and performing supervised gradient based learning.</description><creator>Ratitch, Bohdana.</creator><contributor>Therien, Denis (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Artificial Intelligence.</subject><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Continuous function identification with fuzzy cellular automata</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r207tr465.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k930c044g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pk02cd05w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:19:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A laboratory study was conducted to bioremediate a fine textured soil contaminated with diesel. The local microorganisms were stimulated by supplying nutrients with the aid of a water table management system. A fine textured soil, contaminated for more than 20 years, with more than 6500 mg/kg of diesel was packed in fifteen columns, 2 m long and 0.2 m in diameter. Twelve out of fifteen soil columns were subjected to bioremediaton, by supplying nutrients, water and air at desired depths. Three columns were used as a control to monitor passive degradation of contaminant without intervention. The experiment was designed to employ three different treatments in triplicates. In the first treatment, nutrients, air and water were supplied. In the second, only nutrients and water were applied and in the third, water alone was applied. These treatments were applied by two different water table management strategies. In the first, three columns were remediated by following a full column remediation strategy, while in the second, nine columns were treated in a stagewise manner, by maintaining the water table at 1 m depth from surface.

The macrophage, which represents 60--80% of the cell population of the proliferating pseudomembrane (PM) formed around a loose prosthesis, is the key cell responsible for many of the events associated with periprosthetic osteolysis. Phagocytosis of particulate debris by macrophages, incites a cascade of events that result in the release of substances capable of stimulating the bone resorption including IL-1, TNF-alpha, and PGE2. The exact mechanisms by which the inflammatory cells interact with osteoblast/osteoclast cells and the relative importance of the various chemical mediators on the ultimate bone lysis remain poorly understood. It was recently demonstrated that bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption mediated by particle-induced foreign body macrophages. Moreover, it was demonstrated in vivo and in vitro that their actions implicate osteoclast and/or macrophage apoptosis. These results strongly suggest that the modulation of apoptosis at the prosthesis-bone interface may serve as a potent target for therapeutic control. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanism of PM cell death at the prosthesis-bone interface of failed THAs.

The phenomenon of dual-process learning affords an ideal opportunity to explore the complexities inherent in establishing this relationship. Dual-process learning occurs when depression (habituation) and facilitation (sensitization) are expressed simultaneously within a neural network and compete to determine the behavioural outcome. A large body of literature is reviewed to define characteristics which are common across the neural networks that exhibit dual-process learning: depression occurs at loci early in the reflex pathway, upstream of the modulatory system necessary for the induction of facilitation. Consequently, depression not only competes directly with facilitation for the determination, of behavioural change (by serial and/or parallel expression), but depression also precludes the ongoing development and maintenance of sensitization (by serial induction). A mathematical model is presented to formally describe the nature of this competition and how this competition leads to the kinetics of dual-process learning. The tentacle withdrawal reflex of the snag Helix aspersa exhibits dual-process learning and was further investigated in this study. The neural circuit mediating tentacle withdrawal is described along with the nature and the location of plasticity which occurs within that circuit. In turn, plasticity at the cellular level is related, via the network level, to plasticity at the behavioural level. The data demonstrate the importance of localizing the sites of plasticity within a neural network in order to explain (1) how plasticity at a particular locus influences plasticity occurring elsewhere in the network and (2) how plasticity at different loci affect different aspects of behaviour.</description><creator>Prescott, Steven A.</creator><contributor>Chase, Ronald (advisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Brown garden snail -- Behavior.</subject><subject>Habituation (Neuropsychology)</subject><title>Interactions of habituation and sensitization at the network level illustrated by the tentacle withdrawal reflex of a snail</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t148fk20n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2z10ws50j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4m90dx530</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:19:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The thesis describes a program of research aimed at exploring the consequences of confronting potential perpetrators of discrimination with their own prejudice. An experimental paradigm was introduced that involved confronting advantaged group members with their own potential prejudices in a series of two studies. In the first study, White participants who admitted to some prejudice were, surprisingly, also more likely to genuinely reflect on and challenge their prejudice. A second experiment investigated the interpersonal consequences of stereotype threat in advantaged group members. Male participants were confronted with the possibility of confirming the negative stereotype that "men are sexist". The results indicated that male participants attempted to avoid confirmation of the negative stereotype by making a deliberate effort to appear nonsexist on a gender task. These findings contrast the results of stereotype threat theory found for disadvantaged group members and are discussed in terms of their implications for advantaged group members.</description><creator>Poore, Abigail G.</creator><contributor>Taylor, Donald M.

An isocentric cobalt unit was evaluated for its potential use in radiosurgery in three areas: (1) the physical properties of its radiosurgical beams, (2) the quality of radiosurgical dose distributions obtained with 4 to 10 non-coplanar arcs, and (3) the accuracy with which the radiosurgical dose can be delivered. In each of these areas the 10 MV beam of a linear accelerator served as a standard for comparison. The difference between the 80%--20% penumbras of the radiosurgical fields of the cobalt-60 and 10 MV photon beams is remarkably small, with the cobalt-60 beam penumbras on the average only about 0.7 mm larger than those of the linac beam. Differences between the cobalt-60 and 10 MV plans in terms of dose homogeneity within the target volume and conformity of the prescribed isodose volume to the target volume are also minimal, and therefore of limited clinical significance. Moreover, measured obtained isodose distributions of a radiosurgical procedure performed on the isocentric cobalt unit agreed with calculated distributions to within the +/-1 mm spatial and +/-5% numerical dose tolerances which are generally accepted in radiosurgery. The viability of isocentric cobalt units for radiosurgery would be of particular interest for centers in developing counties where cobalt units, because of their relatively low costs, provide the only megavoltage source of radiation for radiotherapy, and could easily and inexpensively be modified for radiosurgery.</description><creator>Poffenbarger, Brett A.</creator><contributor>Podgorsak, E.

A total of 576 Single Comb White Leghorn hens (SCWL) at 26 weeks of age were fed diets containing 15% FS and a corn-soybean meal diet (C) supplemented with and without ferlac 25 (F25) or Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA). Feed consumption was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased by FS supplemented with both F25 and LA. Dietary treatments had no significant (p &gt; 0.05) effect on feed conversion. Egg production was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher among the FS probiotic supplemented diets and significantly (p &lt; 0.05) lower for dietary FS supplemented with LA. However, egg yolk weight did not respond to dietary treatments (p &gt; 0.05). Body weight was significantly low for all FS fed groups. Shell thickness was not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05) among experimental treatments, while haugh units were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher for FS group supplemented with LA. Probiotic supplementation significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reduced plasma cholesterol (CHL) from 161mg/dL in C diet to 117mg/dL in probiotic supplemented groups. Plasma triglycerides (TG) were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reduced from 2.8g/dL in FS to 1.9g/dL in probiotic supplemented groups while egg yolk CHL was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reduced by probiotic supplementation on FS treatments from 14.04mg/g in FS fed group to 10.16mg/g in LA supplemented FS group.

Unlike soybeans, lupine seeds do not need to be processed before consumption. Being a member of the legume family, lupines improve soil structure and fertility. Lupines also have the advantage of being able to grow in cooler climates and in fields of lower fertility than soybean. Lupine production is relatively new in Eastern Canada and new diseases limit production in this region. In 1990, a Phoma sp. was isolated from diseased lupine in Quebec and Nova Scotia. This research was undertaken to acquire further knowledge about this lupine pathogen. The morphological characteristics of this fungus do not exactly fit the description of any other Phoma sp., but it is very close to P. pinodella. This Phoma sp. on lupines may be a new variety of P. pinodella affecting lupine in particular. In vitro, mycelium grew over a wide range of temperatures (5°--35°C), the optimal temperature being 25°C. Spore germination occurred under different conditions of temperature, from 10°C to 35°C, the optimum being 25°C. Spores germinated at relative humidities from 94% to 100%, (-7.027 to 0 MPa) the optimum being between 98% and 100% (-2.768 to 0 MPa). In controlled environment, disease symptoms appeared over a wide range of leaf wetness durations (8 h--36 h) and temperature regimes (15°C--30°C). The most extensive disease symptoms occurred following 36 hours of leaf wetness duration at 30°C. This Phoma sp. survived over winter in infected stubble of lupines of the previous year crop. The infected crop residue may be another source of inoculum of this seedborne pathogen.</description><creator>Phaneuf, Edith.</creator><date>1998</date><subject>Phoma -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Phytopathogenic fungi -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Lupines -- Diseases and pests -- Québec (Province).</subject><title>Description and study of a Phoma sp., a new fungal pathogen of lupines (Lupinus albus L.), in Québec</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sx61dp556.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r207tr47f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Plant Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sj1394119</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:19:35Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The objective of this study was to develop an in vitro model in lamprey, a lower vertebrate, for investigating the neural circuitry controlling feeding behavior. Microstimulation of the trigeminal afferents and some of the rhombencephalic regions that project to the trigeminal motor nucleus were shown to elicit excitatory synaptic responses in trigeminal motoneurons involving both AMPA/Kainate and NMDA receptors. Disynaptic glycinergic inhibition was also present in some cases. Interestingly, rhythmical membrane potential oscillations were elicited in trigeminal motoneurons upon stimulation of trigeminal afferents or the principal sensory nucleus.

Compost temperature and moisture were monitored regularly, and compost samples were analyzed for physico-chemical characteristics at the beginning in the fall, before turning in spring, and at the end of each composting cycle. A geotextile cover was tested. Compost leachate volumes were measured throughout the two composting cycles. In addition, the leachate was submitted to phytotoxicity tests and physico-chemical analyses. Selected phytopathogens were introduced in the compost in order to assess their potential for survival during the composting process. Three pathogens having resistant survival structures were included: Plasmodiophora brassicae, Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cucumerinum , and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.

One approach, used in some published analyses, is based on 'ecological' variables. These variables are of the distribution of characteristics of all patients of a given physician. Typically means and proportions are used for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. The final physician-level analysis relies then on a multiple linear regression model where the rate of the relevant outcome, among patients of a given physician, is the dependent variable and the independent variables include both ecological variables and physicians' characteristics of interest. Another innovative approach proposed and investigated in this study employs the ratio of the observed to the expected number of outcomes among patients of a given physician. The first step of the analysis is an estimation of expected probability of the outcome for an individual patient as a function of this patient's own characteristics. The physician level analysis involves regressing the ratio of observed to expected number of outcomes on the relevant physicians' characteristics.

Therefore, 41 samples from of plants commonly ingested by the Maasai, were investigated for the presence of phenols and antioxidant activity. Phenols were detected in all 41 crude extracts. All extracts were screened for antioxidant activity using 2 radicals (1,1 diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radical; peroxyl radical). Extracts that displayed activity equal to or significantly greater than the antioxidant standards (ascorbic acid; Trolox) in both screening tests include (p &lt; 0.05): Acacia nilotica and Acacia drepanolobium. These results were significantly correlated to total phenols (r = -0.51 and 0.79; p &lt; 0.01). Eleven extracts were assessed for their ability to protect LDL from in-vitro oxidation and these extracts showed this ability equal to or significantly greater than the antioxidant standards (p &lt; 0.05). Dose response was demonstrated in this assay using 3 concentrations of the crude extract of A. drepanolobium and an ethyl acetate fraction of this extract exhibited significantly stronger activity than the other fractions (water, chloroform) (p &lt; 0.05). All extracts were of a mixed chemical nature and yet some displayed antioxidant activity equal to or greater than the pure antioxidants standards. The correlations established suggest that the antioxidant activity is phenolic in make-up.</description><creator>Lindhorst, Kathleen.</creator><contributor>Johns, Tim (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Antioxidants.</subject><subject>Masai (African people) -- Nutrition.</subject><subject>Phenols.</subject><title>Antioxidant activity of phenolic fraction of plant products ingested by the Maasai</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dz010s28x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1r66j331c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cn69m621n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:19:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Knowledge of carcass merit will help the meat duck breeder identify superior stock and accelerate genetic improvement. Selection for leanness will enhance product acceptance by the consumer. Heritability values for carcass traits are in the medium-high range. Feed intake level during rearing is critical for reproduction. The objectives were to evaluate (1) the response of breast muscle thickness of the F1 progeny from parent breeders selected for maximum muscle thickness at market age and (2) the effect of 2 levels of feed restriction during development for subsequent egg production. In a commercial flock, 4842 Pekin ducks (Brome Lake Ducks Ltd.) were individually weighed and measured by ultrasound for breast muscle thickness (MT, mm) at 47 days of age. Three groups of 120 females and 25 males each were selected and allocated to the following groups: (1) control (CT), randomly selected; (2) maximum body weight (BW), and (3) maximum MT. From 7 to 23 wk old, one half of breeders followed a conventional restriction (CR) at 67 g feed/kg body weight daily, the other half were slightly more restricted following a Macdonald restriction (MR) at the same intake as CR but with a weekly skip-a-day feeding.

These components were the longevity, courtship, mate competition, and daily and lifetime fertilization. Small males were less fit than large males: they had a reduced longevity, took longer to induce female mating behavior, rarely succeeded in mating females when in competition with large males and had lower fertilization capacity; female fertilized by small males oviposited in the first two days of their life only one third of the progeny of daughters mated by large males. The impact of males fitness on optimal sex allocation by females parasitoids was evaluated by measuring the primary and tertiary sex ratios (proportion of males in the progeny) produced by a female T. evanescens when ovipositing in small and large hosts (low and high quality patches). Females of T. evanescens, an arrhenotokous species, have control on the sex ratio of their offspring by regulation of the sperm's access to the egg. Certain combinations of male and female eggs deposited in a host patch result in greater fitness than others. As predicted, females produced a significantly higher proportion of males on the low quality patches. T. evanescens females adjusted the sex ratio allocated to a patch of homogeneous quality and under complete local mate competition to the expected fitness of their sons, as smaller males have a lower fitness and are expected to have low fertilization capacity and therefore fertilize less females. To optimize her fitness gain (the capacity of the individual to transmit its genes), the sex ratio is increased in order to have all daughters mated.</description><creator>Lagacé, Martine.</creator><contributor>Boivin, Guy (advisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Trichogramma evanescens -- Behavior.</subject><subject>Trichogramma evanescens -- Reproduction.</subject><subject>Sex allocation.</subject><title>Male fitness and optimal sex allocation in Trichogramma evanescens</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3484zj83n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fb494b45w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sj139412k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:19:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Human nonspecific cross-reacting antigen (NCA), a close relative of the tumour marker human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), is also an in vitro homotypic intercellular adhesion molecule capable of inhibiting differentiation when expressed ectopically in myoblasts. Moreover, NCA appears to be overexpressed at the transcriptional level to a greater extent and more frequently in colorectal carcinomas than CEA. This study examines the transcriptional control mechanisms responsible for orchestrating NCA expression. The region within 283 bp upstream of the translational start site of the NCA gene was found to be capable of directing high levels of expression in functional promoter assays. Footprinting experiments identified three cis-acting elements and mobility-shift assays revealed that the first of these elements is bound by USF1 and USF2, and the second two are bound by Sp1 and Sp3. No cis-acting elements corresponding to CEA FP4 or the silencer CEA FP5 of the CEA promoter were detected in the NCA promoter, which may contribute to the differential expression of NCA versus CEA in tumourigenesis.</description><creator>Koops, Marten Derek.</creator><contributor>Stanners, C.

Success of dental implants appears to be related to the quality of bone. Bone of high quality will ensure better implant stability and, consequently, better conditions for osseointegration. This thesis reviews both and human data related to bone quality in association with endosseous titanium implant placement. Biomechanical pull out testing is one among several methods used to quantitatively assess the forces required to remove an implant from bone. Pull out testing has the advantage of assessing the biomechanical stress between two materials of different physical and chemical properties, in this case bone and a titanium, implant surface. The variability of our results in the animal model led us to review our laboratory notes. Interesting correlations between the initial implant stability and the eventual pull out values were identified. Clinical data involving many variables were available from previous clinical trials and an attempt was made to retrospectively evaluate this information. The goal of this process was to determine, clinically, if a similar correlation could be identified between initial impressions at the time of implant placement and ultimate implant success. Clinical data revealed that the following variables were important for the final prognosis of an implant: dental arch, implant length, method of insertion, bone graft, the surgeon, jaw bone quality and jaw bone quantity. Using a sophisticated statistical analysis, generalized estimating equation, most of these factors were found only to indirectly influence the success or failure of an implant. Our clinical findings suggested that jaw bone quality and quantity were the primary determining factors for implant success. This supports our observations from the animal study.</description><creator>Guben, Tamara Heidi.</creator><date>1998</date><subject>Health Sciences, Dentistry.</subject><title>Bone quality in osseointegration : a biomechanical study, using the rat tibia, and clinical evaluation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qz20sv96t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b8515q649</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Dentistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xw42n9996</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:19:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Alarm correlation is becoming one of the most central techniques in managing the high volume of alarm messages in fault management area, since the speed and accuracy of fault management are heavily dependent on it. The alarm correlation approach of this thesis helps operators to filter and condense the incoming alarms to meaningful high-level alarms, and diagnoses them automatically and efficiently. This research includes the comparison among existing alarm correlation approaches, and builds a class level network management system model. In managed system domain, dependency model among related objects for fault propagation is also built. In managing system, the alarm I correlation algorithm is represented by UML object oriented methodology, especially time constraints is integrated to this algorithm and nine temporal relations are built between a pair of alarms. Five alarm correlation methods are applied in combination or in sequence to determine causality relationships among a cluster of alarms, and efficiently filter redundant alarms. Part of the algorithm is also implemented in Java on Advent Web based network management platform, which is client/server architecture.</description><creator>Gu, Zhonghui.</creator><date>1998</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Temporal event correlation for fault localization in computer networks</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3484zj84x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xw42n9996</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gq67jt431</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:19:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Recent studies demonstrate that the dissolved iron in seawater is bound to strong organic complexes that have stability constants comparable to those of microbial iron chelates (siderophores). We investigated iron acquisition by 7 strains of heterotrophic marine bacteria using siderophores as a model for the natural iron-binding ligands. Siderophores were detected in the supernatants of 4 strains. All strains utilized iron bound to siderophores regardless of whether they produced their own. The majority took up iron bound to the fungal siderophore desferrioxamine B (dfoB). Over half also utilized iron bound to strain Neptune's siderophore, nep-L, while iron bound to pwf-L was available solely to the producing strain, Pwf3. Uptake rates of Fe-siderophores were similar among iron-limited strains and among ligands. Transport of Fe-dfoB in Neptune was enhanced 20 times by iron limitation. The half-saturation constant of Fe-dfoB transport was 15 nM, the lowest reported for Fe-siderophore transport in microorganisms. In contrast, uptake of inorganic iron (Fe' ) by iron-limited Neptune did not saturate at the highest concentration tested and was not upregulated under iron stress. This suggests that Fe ' uptake occurs by simple diffusion through the outer membrane. Strain Lmg1, the sole catechol producer, did not take up iron bound to exogenous siderophores (dfoB, pwf-L, or nep-L). However, it utilized iron bound to its own ligand and, possibly, iron bound to the synthetic chelator EDTA. Transport of Fe' by iron-limited Lmg1 was 10 times higher than in the other strains and was upregulated 46 times in low iron conditions. The results suggest iron transport in Lmg 1 may be mediated by surface-associated catechol siderophores that scavenge inorganic ferric species as well as iron bound to weaker complexes, such as EDTA. This study elucidates the importance of siderophores in iron transport by heterotrophic marine bacteria.

The calculated values of albedo and absorption were consistent with the measurements. Uncertainties in absorption measurements due to instrument error were high. The model is used to determine cloud susceptibility, the sensitivity of cloud albedo to changes in droplet concentration. The susceptibilities determined from these calculations agree well with previous studies.

This framework is based on two fundamental design decisions. Firstly, the framework uses object-oriented techniques to automatically build a strictly-typed abstract syntax tree that matches the grammar of the compiled language and simplifies debugging. Secondly, the framework generates tree-walker classes using an extended version of the visitor design pattern which enables the implementation of actions on the nodes of the abstract syntax tree using inheritance. These two design decisions lead to a tool that supports a shorter development cycle for constructing compilers. To demonstrate the simplicity of the framework, we discuss the implementation of a state-of-the-art almost linear time points-to analysis. We also provide a brief description of other systems that have been implemented using the SableCC tool. We conclude that the use of object-oriented techniques significantly reduces the length of the programmer written code, can shorten the development time and finally, makes the code easier to read and maintain.</description><creator>Gagnon, Etienne.</creator><date>1998</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>SableCC, an object-oriented compiler framework</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5q47rq888.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0c483m29g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vt150m19r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:19:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We used a mailed questionnaire to investigate over-the-counter (OTC) analgesic medication use. The response rate was 77% (n= 1.339). 79% of women and 64% of men had consumed OTC analgesics in the past month, mostly on only 1-3 days, but 6% of users took them every day or almost every day. The most common reason for use was headache, followed by back and joint pain. 5% used larger doses than recommended. Women took more analgesics, but reported suffering more problems: gender differences disappeared when the number of problems was controlled. Remembered mood before and after medication indicated a substantial improvement in mood that was only partially explained by pain relief. This may explain the 81 cases who reported taking OTC analgesics for fatigue, stress, etc. Health practitioners need to determine if OTC analgesic use is appropriate and pain relief is adequate. Effects of OTC analgesics on mood need to be further investigated.</description><creator>Fraser, Mary I.</creator><date>1998</date><subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacy.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</subject><title>Uses of over-the-counter analgesic agents in the Montreal population</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zc77ss02p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vt150m19r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychiatry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):2300</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
