Whether the disputes are with their suppliers, employees or with consumers, managing  disputes effectively is integral to healthy business risk management. While  arbitration is a well-known alternative in disputes with suppliers or employees, its  use is infrequent in disputes with consumers. The purpose of this thesis is to  introduce arbitration as an option for alternative dispute resolution between  businesses and consumers. Banking institutions, insurance companies, businesses in  the securities industry and most suppliers of good and services can usefully take  advantage of this tool. In our view, the legislative framework in Quebec does not  create any barriers to the use of this technique, but provides for some guidelines  that corporations must comply with. We hope this paper encourages companies to  exercise control of the management of their disputes with consumers with the help of  arbitration mechanisms that are at the same time consistent with consumers' rights  as set out in Quebec legislation.</description><creator>Raymond-Bougie, Stéphanie</creator><contributor>Gelinas, Fabien (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Dispute resolution (Law) -- Québec (Province)</subject><subject>Consumer protection -- Law and legislation -- Québec (Province)</subject><title>L'arbitrage des différends en droit de la consommation : une nouvelle approche</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0z708x114.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/37720d37q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:w6634428j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The person has in theory been at the center of the law since  Gaius divided the private law into persons, things, and actions. In constructing the  person, however, the law takes apart and sets aside the human being, replacing it  with a legal abstraction that diverges markedly from it. This gap is partly due to  the way the law has been structured conceptually, as a set of bounded categories  clearly distinguished from each other. Viewing the person as the result of a series  of either/or classificatory decisions privileges the liberal model of the person: a  partimonialized, transactionalized bearer of rights. If instead we reconceptualize  the persons-things-actions structure of the private law to emphasize the dynamic  interactions between the categories, we can bring back into the concept of the  person some aspects of the human being---such as personal relationships---that have  traditionally been outside legal analysis.</description><creator>Reiter, Eric H.</creator><contributor>Macdonald, Roderick (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Persons (Law)</subject><title>Towards a reintegration of the human being in law</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2f75r855d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w6634428j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1831ck551</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis presents an assessment of the effectiveness of the  compliance mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol in promoting compliance with the  obligations under the Protocol. First, theoretical approaches to compliance are  explored in order to understand the reasons for which states comply, using both  international legal and international relations theory. This not only contributes to  a greater understanding of compliance, but also helps to establish a framework of  criteria for the assessment. Second, practical experience with the compliance  mechanisms of the Montreal Protocol is used to develop further assessment criteria.  Following a detailed description and analysis of the compliance mechanisms, the  insights from theory and practice are applied. The results show that the Kyoto  Protocol's compliance mechanisms present an innovative balance of managerial and  incentive strategies and integrate important elements emphasised by constructivist  approaches to international law. They are thus designed effectively to promote  compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.</description><creator>Friedrich, Jurgën, 1975-</creator><contributor>Ellis, Jaye (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Environmental law.</subject><subject>Climatic changes.</subject><title>Compliance with international law : the Kyoto protocol's compliance mechanisms as an effective tool to promote compliance?</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tq57nr56f.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1831ck551</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k643b1852</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>To be fair and equitable are aims inherent in most legal  systems, whether domestic or international, but are usually tacitly stated. With  respect to foreign direct investment (FDI) they constitute a standard of treatment  which lacks a clear definition. Nevertheless, the recurrence of this standard in  conventional instruments makes it one of the focal points of this branch of  international law. The main goal of this thesis is to explore and understand the  standard of fair and equitable treatment. To understand its definition, it is first  necessary to undertake a theoretical analysis of the notion. Secondly, having  assessed the general meaning to fair and equitable treatment, an attempt is made to  assess the difficulties which have arisen from its incorporation in Chapter 11 of  the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Finally, the thesis tries to assess  where the concept stands in international law and whether or not it has passed into  the corpus of customary international law.</description><creator>Fouret, Julien</creator><contributor>de Mestral, Armand (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Canada.

In the United States, for example,  the prison population has more than quadrupled since 1980. As a response to the  considerable incarceration costs, the number of private prisons and the number of  prisoners working for private corporations have increased significantly. Proponents  of private sector involvement in prison industries argue that inmate labour can  reduce the incarceration costs and contribute to rehabilitation of  prisoners. The question of private sector involvement in prison facilities  raises significant concerns as regards to international labour standards. Opponents  of private sector involvement argue that private hiring of prison labour can involve  exploitation. They also argue that the authority for punishment is a core  governmental function that cannot be delegated to the private sector. Furthermore,  in most cases, labour and social security laws are not applied to inmates.  Therefore, prison labour can constitute unfair competition with free labour or even  go as far as to replace free labour.</description><creator>Thalmann, Vanessa</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Privatization -- United States</subject><subject>Prisons -- United States</subject><subject>Convict labor</subject><subject>Convict labor -- United States</subject><subject>Prisons</subject><subject>Corrections -- Contracting out -- United States</subject><subject>Corrections -- Contracting out</subject><subject>Privatization</subject><title>Prison labour for private corporations : the impact of human rights</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ws859g20x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bz60cw82n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nk322d89n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis, by reviewing a human rights project implemented by  the Association for Water and Rural Development (AWARD), a South African based  non-governmental organization (NGO), seeks to address the ongoing discussion  regarding the role of international human rights NGOs in promoting socio-economic  rights, adding a local perspective to this debate. It argues that international  human rights NGOs working on socio-economic rights issues need to evaluate their  approaches to promoting socio-economic rights, including their methodologies and  strategies, and to engage more substantively with local NGOs concentrating on these  issues. Namely, this thesis reviews a recent article written by Kenneth Roth, the  Executive Director of Human Rights Watch (HRW), expressing HRW's views on promoting  socio-economic rights. In order to support its main arguments, this thesis, using  AWARD's human rights project, introduces a clear conceptual framework for economic  and social rights that focuses on the right to water, and considers various  methodological approaches for promoting socio-economic rights.</description><creator>Pejan, Ramin</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Human rights -- South Africa</subject><subject>Non-governmental organizations -- South Africa</subject><subject>Social rights -- South Africa</subject><title>A reflection on international human rights non-governmental organizations' approach to promoting socio-economic rights : lessons from a South African experience</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qn59q450f.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nk322d89n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bc386j75x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The prosecutorial standard for incitement is subject to  different approaches in the common law and civil law traditions respectively. The  most crucial difference lies in the role attributed to the result as a definitional  element of the offence. While the civil law generally characterizes proof of results  as a prerequisite to liability, the common law views it as significant but not  determinative of guilt. This divergence is expounded at the international level,  which condones both approaches with respect to different crimes, employing the  common law approach only to genocide and relegating all other crimes to the purview  of the civil law approach. The practical effect is a focus on the gravity of the  substantive crime to which incitement attaches, rather than on the crucial role of  incitement itself. This thesis will seek to elucidate the parameters of this debate  with the aim of deconstructing and redrawing preconceived barriers in international  criminal law.</description><creator>Schuetze, Jennifer Johanna</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Genocide</subject><subject>War crimes</subject><subject>Criminal liability (International law)</subject><subject>Inchoate offenses</subject><subject>Prosecution</subject><subject>Criminal procedure (International law)</subject><title>To cause or not to cause, that is the question : the prosecutorial standard for incitement at international criminal law</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fx719m925.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bc386j75x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mk61rh54r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We are witness today, within a context of an increasingly  integrated European Union, to the making of a new common legal order which is that  of the European Community. This new ius commune Europaeum will have to be based on  legal foundations that can be adhered to by all member states. In this perspective,  it is indispensable to investigate whether domestic legal systems of the member  states are able to adopt legal concepts of other member states without undermining  their cohesive natures. Only then will it be possible to build the emerging ius  commune on a conceptual legal framework, which is not to be perceived as a  Fremdkorper in the participating states.

Continuous occurrence of karoshi in Japan offers an opportunity to reconsider the  contemporary working environment, and especially the workers' compensation system.  Strongly bound by the traditional notion of work accident, the Japanese workers'  compensation system has shown difficulty handling karoshi cases. This fact calls  into question the adequacy of the current workers' compensation scheme in the work  environment it is meant to oversee. To analyze the issue, this thesis will use a  comparative law method. The basis of comparison will be Ontario, Canada, which  shares a system similar to Japan's, but does not produce karoshi cases. Particular  emphasis will be put on stress claims and claims from women, since both share some  similarities with karoshi claims. The findings from this comparison will offer a  valuable basis for discussion of the current and the future of workers' compensation  and other protection systems in Japan.</description><creator>Takizawa, Ayumi</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Workers' compensation -- Law and legislation -- Ontario</subject><subject>Workers' compensation -- Law and legislation -- Japan</subject><subject>Women -- Job stress -- Japan</subject><title>Workers' compensation facing current issues : comparative analysis between Japan and Canada</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6108vb93r.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/474299673</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2227mq24d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The promulgation of the TRIPS Agreement marks a new direction  for international copyright: copyright protection has been put under the auspices of  the world trading system. During the arduous negotiations, developing countries  played a minor role due to the unilateral trade threats exerted by the United  States. As a result, the final text of the TRIPs mainly mirrors the domestic  copyright legislations of those developed countries. The question of what impact the TRIPs will have on developing  Member States has triggered hot debates. While acknowledging that a short-term  negative impact is likely, the long-term effects of a strengthened copyright regime  in those countries are hard to predict at this time. The author uses China as a case  study to illustrate the difficulties that developing nations might have in  implementing and enforcing such heightened copyright standards. Moreover, possible  solutions to minimize any adverse effects of the TRIPs Agreement are  discussed.</description><creator>Wang, Xiaorong, 1979-</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Intellectual property -- Developing countries</subject><subject>Intellectual property (International law)</subject><title>International copyright and developing countries : the impact of the TRIPs Agreement</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gb19f6417.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2227mq24d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2v23vt914</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Dominant theories of aboriginal rights articulate the relation  between rights and identity in terms of a logic which treats identity as an  irreducible good and rights as the instrumental means of its protection. However,  identity claims and legal claims emerge in our use of language. Identity and the  institutions in which identities are expressed and experienced are constituted in  speech. A close analysis reveals the degree to which law and identity are a systemic  imbrication of normative claims characterized by an innate indeterminacy. This  indeterminacy renders all rights and identity claims contingent on their reception  and validation by others.</description><creator>Richards, Nathan</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Indians of North America -- Legal status, laws, etc. -- Canada.</subject><subject>Critical legal studies -- Canada.</subject><title>Normative dimensions of cultural identity</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hh63sw415.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2v23vt914</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6m311p86s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The current international tax regime was conceived at the  beginning of the 20th Century and the rules have remained relatively unchanged since  then. The operational rules of the international tax regime were designed for an  economic era in which major international commercial enterprises were confined  within a physical paradigm, and they had succeeded in achieving an acceptable and  practical allocation of tax revenue that was being generated from international  commerce. As commerce sunders itself from its physical boundaries, the traditional  international tax rules that are confined within a physical paradigm fail to provide  an adequate solution to the tax issues raised by EC business  activities. The challenges raised by EC business activities have been  recognized by many governments and the OECD, and the OECD has tried to resolve these  issues by modifying the traditional rules. The aim of this thesis is to analyse  whether the professed modifications of the traditional rules could provide an  adequate solution to the challenges raise by EC business activities, as well as to  determine whether it is possible to develop and implement a new set of operation  rules, premised on the implicit justifications of the existing operational rules,  for the taxation of multinational corporations conducting EC business activities.  The thesis does not intend to provide an ultimate solution, but it tries to consider  an alternative approach that could be applicable for the taxation of EC business  activities, and to contribute to the debate, assuming that national governments  intend to tax corporations.</description><creator>Rahman, Kazi Muinur</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Electronic commerce -- Taxation -- Law and legislation</subject><title>A proposal for the taxation of electronic commerce /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z029p5236.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6m311p86s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:02870w433</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Aircraft engine emissions from civil aviation cause several  adverse effects to the atmospheric environment. These emissions are among the known  major contributors to changes in atmospheric chemistry and global climate change.  One way in which the international community has responded to the problem has been  the adoption of several international treaties, generally dealing with subjects such  as protection of the ozone layer, long-range transboundary air pollution, and global  climate change. The other way in which the problem has been dealt with is the  adoption of an industry-specific international regulatory regime for controlling  aircraft engine emissions from civil aviation. In this regard, the international  community has, through the law making functions of the International Civil Aviation  Organization (ICAO), adopted the mechanism of Standards and Recommended Practices  (SARPs) to establish a regulatory framework aimed at reducing environmentally  harmful engine emissions. These SARPs, though international in nature, are to be  implemented at the national level by the member states of ICAO. This thesis provides a review of current understanding of the  effects of aircraft engine emissions on the atmospheric environment and an analysis  of the international responses to the problem.

Moreover, the development of  bilateral air services agreements, from the Bermuda Agreements to the U.S.'s  "Open Skies" Policy, is addressed. Then, a study of the ICAO actions  toward liberalization is undertaken. An analysis from the deregulation, privatization in the American  and E.U.'s aviation market to the reform in the Chinese civil aviation is conducted.  Under the impact of the global liberalization trend, the Chinese aviation industry  is creating a "deepen, widen" reform. Specifically, China Southern's  imminent entrance into SkyTeam will significantly push the Chinese aviation policy  toward liberalization. A detailed comparative study of bilateral air transport  agreements between China, the United States, and Germany will show the recent  progress of the Chinese aviation policy. Finally, an argument for the separation of air cargo from air  passengers in the liberalization process, especially for China's negotiation of  bilateral agreements, is presented.</description><creator>Liu, Jin, 1981-</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Aeronautics, Commercial -- Law and legislation -- China</subject><subject>Aeronautics, Commercial -- Law and legislation</subject><subject>Aeronautics, Commercial -- Deregulation -- China</subject><title>Liberalizing air transport regulation in the People's Republic of China</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c821gk405.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r207tp86q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:vd66w047h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:14Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Increasing the combustor exit temperature in gas turbines is an  effective means to increase engine power. While occasional metallurgical advances  allow gradual temperature increases, improving the internal/external cooling of the  blades is the only way to permit significant temperature gains. In this work, a  methodology for aerodynamic and conjugate heat transfer computational analysis of  cooled turbine blades is developed. Flow solutions are obtained using an implicit,  three-dimensional, finite-element Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes flow solver.  Efficient non-reflecting boundary conditions are derived and implemented to reduce  the size of the solution domain and accelerate convergence. These are shown to be  essential for the accurate capturing of shock waves and wakes. The methodology is  demonstrated on the convection-cooled NASA-C3X turbine vane, by coupling heat  conduction in the solid vane with heat transfer from the internal cooling flow and  the external hot-gas flow. Both aerodynamic and heat transfer results are compared  against experimental data.</description><creator>Findlay, Jonathon Peter</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Engineering, Aerospace.</subject><title>3-D conjugate heat transfer analysis of a cooled transonic turbine blade using non-reflecting boundary conditions</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2j62s536f.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vd66w047h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q524jp231</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Stenting is becoming the major interventional cardiology  procedure worldwide. However restenosis remains a major limitation to the  effectiveness of stents. Alterations to the local hemodynamics in the stented  segment of the artery is a potential factor in the development of in-stent  restenosis. The characterization of wall shear stress and of blood flow patterns in  a stented artery is therefore necessary for a good understanding of the phenomenon.  We have used a time-dependent 3D numerical model of a stented coronary artery to  study the characteristics of the blood flow and the shear stress distribution. Our  results show that the presence of the stent results in significant secondary flow.  Regions of low shear stress were localized around the struts while the struts  exhibited high values of shear stress. These results support the hypothesis that  local hemodynamics may affect the development of in-stent restenosis and can guide  the choice of stent geometries for future stent designs.</description><creator>Faik, Isam</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</subject><title>3D characterization of the hemodynamic parameters in a stented coronary artery</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f4752h26q.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q524jp231</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:79407x87x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Periodic structures play an important role in engineering since  they allow the manipulation of the electromagnetic properties of certain materials.  To design such structures and investigate their different properties, it is  essential to use simulation techniques. Among the various methods that have been  used traditionally, the finite element method offers great advantages. In this  thesis, a three dimensional finite element method is used to obtain the band  diagrams of periodic structures; hierarchal higher-order elements are employed,  thereby opening up the possibility of goal oriented h-p adaptivity. The computed  dispersion curves for doubly-periodic and triply-periodic metallic structures are  presented and compared to previously published curves. The results confirm the  accuracy of the finite element formulation developed in this thesis and its  implementation. Further, the triply-periodic results support the case for using  higher-order, less dense meshes rather than lower-order, more highly refined meshes;  the doubly-periodic results are inconclusive.</description><creator>El-Esber, Lina</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Hierarchal higher order finite element modeling of periodic structures</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p5547r95d.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/79407x87x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8g84mm78b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Potentially large network delay variability experienced by voice  packets when travelling over IP networks complicates the design of a robust voice  conference bridge. Intrastream synchronization is required at the conference bridge  to smooth out network delay jitter on a given stream and provide a continuous stream  of voice packets to the conference bridge core. Interstream synchronization is  needed to provide time synchronization between packets in different streams,  allowing for a mapping of selected voice streams to the conference bridge output and  the creation of a periodic and synchronized output from the conference  bridge. This work presents a design and evaluation of a Synchronized  conference bridge that maps N input voice streams to M output voice streams  representing selected speakers. A conference simulator, designed for this thesis, is  used to characterize the performance of this bridge in terms of delay and packet  loss, speaker selection accuracy and conference audio quality.</description><creator>Elliott, Colm</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Stream synchronization for voice over IP conference bridges</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fn106z69m.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8g84mm78b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:b5644s123</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Computer simulations play an important role in the design and  verification of space robotic operations since on-orbit tests are impossible to  conduct before launch. Thus, accurate computer modelling and simulation of space  robotic tasks is essential. Of particular difficulty are space manipulator  operations, which involve constrained or contact tasks. Here, the contact dynamics  capability in the modelling tools becomes critical for high fidelity simulation.  This in turn implies a need for accurate determination of contact parameters, which  are used as inputs to contact dynamics simulation. In this work, the identification  of contact dynamics parameters based on sensor data obtained during robotic contact  tasks is considered. The contact parameter estimation problem is addressed for simple  and complex contacting geometries using the SPDM Task Verification Facility  Manipulator Test-bed (SMT) at the Canadian Space Agency. The SMT is a  space-representative robotic simulation facility. Single- and multiple-point contact  parameter estimation software toolboxes were developed and used with SMT  experiments. Single point SMT contact experiments were performed with six different  payloads. The single point toolbox was used as part of the process of identifying  payload stiffness from SMT experimental data. Multiple point contact parameter estimation experiments with the  SMT were conducted using a mock-up of an International Space Station Arm Computer  Unit (ACU) as payload. The multiple point toolbox was used to generate contact  stiffness, damping and friction estimates. An evaluation of the sensitivity of the  parameter estimation algorithm to mismatches in ACU physical dimensions and ACU  geometry files was conducted.</description><creator>Agar, Julie</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Contact parameter estimation using a space manipulator verification facility</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2n49t248r.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b5644s123</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:37720d355</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis explores new methods of representing the  electromagnetic forces in any electromechanical or electromagnetic devices using  "off-the-shelf" equipment. It also explores the usefulness of these  methods in the design process of such devices and in the understanding of  electromagnetic forces. Finally, the thesis concentrates on an investigation of  haptics as a new method of allowing the user to 'feel' the electromagnetic  forces. The thesis describes the design of a system that involves the  software development of Graphical User Interface (GUI) to represent the design, with  its electromagnetic flux lines, together with a choice of a commercial haptic device  to represent the resultant forces. It studies two aspects of the system design. The  first is its performance in terms of the refresh rate of the graphics and the force  feedback along with user satisfaction of the overall system design. The second is a  survey of the usefulness of such a design and the enhancements it provides for the  computer simulation of electromagnetic devices. According to the survey, the design performance was good in  terms of refresh rate, and added extra information for the user. However, there has  to be more research conducted to understand human perception of  force.</description><creator>Afanah, Ayman</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>The use of haptics in enhancing the reality of computer simulations of electromagnetic devices /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ks65hc76p.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/37720d355</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hq37vp13r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The heating, or sheet reheat, phase in thermoforming is the  focus of this work. The first objective is to develop a reliable state-space model  of this process for simulation analysis. The second objective is to develop a simple  linear real-time in-cycle controller for the sheet reheat phase. This controller  will improve part quality, decrease energy expenditures and machine wear, and  optimize heating time by assuring a desired sheet temperature distribution. The  final result is a reduction in production cost per part for the thermoforming  industry. A sheet model is developed from first principles, and improved  through the addition of energy absorption terms. The sheet model is tested against  experimental results, giving errors of less than 5°C over the entire  transient temperature curve at different depths after tuning. A linearization assumption is made, and a two-loop control  algorithm is designed for the sheet surface temperatures. These temperatures are  monitored using infrared sensors at different locations on the sheet. Simple PI  controllers are used in real-time to monitor and maintain these IR sensors about a  given step or ramp input, with great precision (less than 1°C  error).</description><creator>Ajersch, Mark</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Modeling and real-time control of sheet reheat phase in thermoforming</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1n79h4958.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hq37vp13r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pr76f402c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Downed woody material (fallen logs) offers spiders (Araneae) and  ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) ideal nesting and foraging sites. In a maple forest  of Forillon National Park, I compared spider and ant assemblages on, adjacent to,  and away from fallen logs, and on these I tested the effects of log type and decay  stage. In a second study, spider and ant assemblages were compared on, adjacent to,  and away from fallen logs in different forest types. In the first experiment spiders were highly affected by trap  placement, and diversity was highest on the wood surface compared to the forest  floor. In contrast, wood type and decomposition stage of logs had few significant  effects on spiders. Log type did not affect the estimated number of spider species  nor the spider catch rates. Decomposition stage did not affect spider collections,  but less decayed logs were more diverse in spider than heavily decayed  logs. The second experiment showed that use of dead wood by spiders  depends on forest type. Ant diversity and abundance was generally low, making it  difficult to offer concrete conclusions related to log use by ant assemblages. This  work brings additional support for the important role of dead wood to forest  arthropod biodiversity.</description><creator>Varady-Szabo, Hirondelle</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Spiders -- Québec (Province) -- Forillon National Park.</subject><subject>Dead trees -- Québec (Province) -- Forillon National Park.</subject><subject>Ants -- Québec (Province) -- Forillon National Park.</subject><title>Spiders and ants associated with fallen logs in Forillon National Park of Canada, Quebec</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n009w2828.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pr76f402c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:j9602118s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The inflammatory response due to chronic smoking in COPD  patients has been well characterized with increases in CD3+ T lymphocytes.

Indeed,  the over-expression of this fusion protein led to reductions in viral  production. In order to validate these findings, RNAi (RNA interference)  technology was harnessed. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was designed to deplete  endogenous CHMP4B. The results show that depletion of CHMP4B via siRNA ablates HIV-1  production. The disruption of the VPS pathway can be determined by  monitoring the fate of TfR (Transferrin Receptor), a cell-surface receptor that is  recycled via the VPS pathway. The uptake of Tf can also be monitored to determine  whether the VPS pathway is functional. Over-expression of the fusion derivative of  CHMP4B or treatment of the cells with CHMP4B-specific siRNA leads to the disruption  of the VPS pathway, as determined by confocal microscopy. Interestingly, down-regulation of CHMP4B expression also  severely restricted the release of EIAV (Equine Infectious Anemia Virus), which  harbors an YPDL motif within the p9 region of its Gag.</description><creator>Sgouroudis, Evridiki</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><subject>Biology, Microbiology.</subject><title>Role of vacuolar protein sorting pathway factor CHMP4B in HIV-1 budding</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j96021192.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n583xv52t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:db78tc55x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:54:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Color and luminance play important roles within the field of  visual arts. The reason for this lies in the complexity of the human visual  perception system. Our brains experience a perceptual tension when processing  isoluminant fields (i.e. fields of equal luminance value) because the luminance and  color processing pathways perceive the two fields differently. Skilled artists  exploit this fact to great effect. This thesis looks at how isoluminance can be  applied to the field of Non-Photorealistic Rendering. Specifically, this thesis  makes a novel contribution to NPR by emphasizing the importance of isoluminance. It  shows how isolumnant color picking can be used to improve existing NPR image  filters, and to create new ones. It presents a geometric technique for isoluminant  color picking and then applies it in a pointillist filter, a new Chuck Close  inspired filter, and a unique image mosaic filter.</description><creator>Seth, Ankush</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Isoluminant color picking and its applications</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1r66j1530.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/db78tc55x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):35775</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
