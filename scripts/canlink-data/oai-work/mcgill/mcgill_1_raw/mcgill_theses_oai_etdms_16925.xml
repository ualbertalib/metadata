Cellulose is the chief constituent of the cell wall of all land plants and is composed of D-glucose residues linked by (1-&gt;4)-B-glycosidic bonds to linear macromolecules of considerable length (2.5 u). Lignin is a three-dimensional polymer based on phenyl propane units, which are connected in a number of different ways and whose structure is still not known in detail. The hemicelluloses are the polysaccharides which accompany cellulose and which are easily hydrolyzed by dilute mineral acids.</description><creator>Gyaw, Maung. O.</creator><contributor>Timell, T.

The death statistics of the more advanced countries like the U.K., the U. S. A. and Japan tell us that cancer to-day is the second greatest cause of death. The death of about 10% of all human beings is due to this dreadful and very ancient disease.

The copper originated from small veins occurring in the surrounding rocks. Lovering (1927) reported on spongy masses of native copper in a peaty deposit near Cooke Montana.

However, it is now possible to free lignin of all carbohydrate without any apparent damage to its solubility in pulping liquors. By cooking this lignin with aqueous sodium sulphide solution, and studying the yields and the sulphur contents of the residual and dissolved portions at different stages, some light has been thrown on the mechanism by which sulphide exerts its beneficial effect.</description><creator>Garrison, Ross.

China is a vast nation: the huge size of the country and the resulting distances combine with the total absence of modern transportation to create a particularly strong demand for air transport. This is an urgent need, especially since the country' s economy, industries and trade cannot develop without transportation.</description><creator>Feng, James. S.</creator><contributor>Rosevear, A.

The purpose or this study is to discover, by an investigation or all Blake's writings -- his lyrics, epics or prophecies, marginalia and letters -- what this statement is, and to set down its skeletal structure. Blake believed that man's imagination forms and gives unity to his experience.</description><creator>Fefferman, Stanley.</creator><contributor>Dudek, L.

The initial work was directed towards an understanding of the metabolism of these organisms and the selection of stable mutants suitable for use in such a study. Five chloramphenicol-resistant strains of R. trifolii were obtained by a "Crystal Violet-tolerance" technique developed during the course of the present research. Suitably resistant strains of R. meliloti could not be isolated. Streptomycin resistance was subsequently selected for among the chloramphenicol-resistant strains.</description><creator>Ellis, Norma.

One of the ways in which it expresses itself is in the desire to commemorate outstanding individuals whose lives have been found to be remarkable and useful in society.</description><creator>Ekpenyong, John.

Cracks so produced are of a brittle nature and may be intercrystalline or transcrystalline depending upon the alloy and corrosive atmosphere involved. Frequently the amount of corrosion associated with the cracking is extremely small. The types of alloys that may be made to stress corrosion crack are numerous. In fact it seems probable that every alloy will so fail given the correct conditions. It is fortunate that the corrosive atmospheres that cause such cracking are relatively few.</description><creator>Easteal, Charles. D.</creator><contributor>MacEwan, J.

This material includes countrymen's proverbs, folk-magic, seasonal festivals, and rites descended from primitive religions. Some of the legends are connected with Angle-Saxon and Roman relics -- barrows, roads, burial grounds, fortifications ethers with old country families.

This is achieved by operating the relays in this region under the control of a linearizing carrier signal. The experimental investigation is carried out on a model using ordinary servo components such as a two-phase motor, an induction tachogenerator, and associated components which are common to instrument servos.. This has the advantage of showing the effect of noise and second-order non-linearities such as backlash and static friction.</description><creator>Dévieux, Carrié.</creator><contributor>Pavlasek, T.
