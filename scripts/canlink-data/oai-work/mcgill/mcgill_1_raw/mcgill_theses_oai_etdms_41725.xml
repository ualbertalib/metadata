Highly variable input material properties and operational procedures accompanied by poor product feedback frequency generate large variations in powder properties. The goal of the research is to develop a model-based control system for the ball milling process of metal powder. The following research objectives are aimed at reducing process variations while maximizing throughput: include ball mill physics into design and computer models, develop control strategies and computer architectures for real-time control, and develop process monitoring and fault diagnosis techniques. Ball mill size reduction theory is presented as a basis for process characterization. Next, process physics are described along with the measurability and controllability of the variables. Then, plant trials are performed to define system behavior and performance specifications of variables and sensors. After that, a sampler for metal powder is developed to automate the entire sieve analysis process. A new ball mill model is created for open-circuit dry ball milling of metal powders. The process model is a combination of rules, equations and heuristics and is implemented using an agent based architecture that can deal with multiple data streams and a network of related sub-models of different sizes and operating time scales. The model architecture is integrated using a programmable logic controller. Control and monitoring algorithms are developed in low-level PC language. A performance plant trial validated the control system and demonstrated that ball milling product specifications, namely size distribution and apparent density, are achievable and maintainable at a 99.7% confidence interval. This new technology will endow Domfer with a serious lead in metal powder manufacturing. Key words. model-based control, ball milling, metal powder.</description><creator>Rail, Alexandre.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Model-based control of metal powder ball milling</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Alexandre Rail, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gm80j0832.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bz60d186r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fn107326t</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:11:35Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The effects of density fluctuations on supernova neutrinos have been studied. Using the formalism developed by Burgess &amp; Michaud (BM) and stellar evolution progenitors by Woosley &amp; Weaver, the expected neutrino flux from a future galactic super-nova have been computed taking into account possible density fluctuations for a 2ν system. It has been shown that within the most recent constraints of mass squared difference values and vacuum mixing angle, neutrino fluxes on earth could be affected depending on the fluctuation levels. The formalism developed by BM has been extended to the case of three neutrino generations. Preliminary results using this model show that in this case as well, density fluctuations could affect the expected neutrino flux. A new multidimensional, non-Riemann solver based, High resolution Shock Capturing (HRSC) scheme has been proposed using the semidiscrete central and Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) data reconstruction methods. The novel aspect of this algorithm is that for robustness, elements of the Piecewise Parabolic Method (PPM) has been incorporated in this HRSC scheme. The algorithm has been applied to the multidimensional classical and Special Relativistic Hydrodynamics (SRHD) equations. The new HRSC algorithm and codes were verified by a number of benchmark tests in one and two dimensions.</description><creator>Rahman, Tanvir.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Physics, Astronomy and Astrophysics.</subject><title>Multidimensional classical and relativistic hydrodynamics using central and WENO schemes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Tanvir Rahman, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jd473149x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fn107326t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:41687n47z</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:11:35Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Although the behavioral phenotype of disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and reading disability (RD) are well established, to date, few studies have assessed the association between the core cognitive characteristics implicated in each disorder. And fewer yet have addressed this in a sample of typically developing preschool and young school age children when such skills are developing and maturing. The present study focused on providing a typical trajectory of attentional and inhibitory performance alongside delay aversion and their association with naming speed, a basic cognitive process involved in the acquisition of later reading skills. Alongside the developmental characteristics of these cognitive domains, the results indicate an association between rapid naming deficits and poor attentional and inhibitory control. The results further suggest distinct association between attentional control, inhibitory control, naming speed and poor attention ratings. These findings have implications for pedagogical planning for children with ADHD and RD.</description><creator>Rezazadeh, Shohreh M.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Cognition.</subject><subject>Reading disability.</subject><subject>Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.</subject><title>The typical trajectory of response inhibition, sustained attention, and delay aversion : the nature of their relationship with naming speed</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Shohreh M.

Grounded, respectively, in a Freudian, a feminist and a mythocritical perspective, these approaches tend to present a negative vision of Nadja's madness. After examining the arguments made by proponents of each approach, this study seeks to lay the foundations for positive analyses which will allow for the rehabilitation of female madness and the foregrounding of the link between insanity and female identity. Breton at once desired and fostered this feminine condition, which he deemed to be essential to creation and the discovery of the secret meaning of life: the marvelous. While it may convey disconcerting qualities, female madness is portrayed as noble and exceptional in this unique book whose title is the Russian word for hope.</description><creator>Lépine, Viviane.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Mental illness in literature.</subject><subject>Breton, André, 1896-1966.

Using individual interviewing as the primary research method, the study revealed 12 major challenge areas, i.e., English as a second language, financial difficulties, outsider feelings, worries about career paths, course work, research network, TA/RA experiences, differences between doctoral and master's studies, isolation, pace of the PhD, motherhood and doctoral study, and adjusting research directions. Through comparing the findings with the literature and the data from secondary sources, this study concluded that the academic adaptation of Mainland Chinese doctoral students in Canada is a process in which cross-cultural adaptation intertwines with disciplinary socialization. The study contributes to literature by (1) documenting an under-researched group---PhD students in education from Mainland China in Canada; and (2) looking at academic adaptation through two lenses: cross-cultural adaptation and disciplinary socialization.</description><creator>Chen, Shuhua, 1977-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Teachers -- Training of -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><subject>College students -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><subject>Adjustment (Psychology)</subject><title>The academic adaptation of mainland Chinese doctoral students in education at McGill University /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Shuhua Chen, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n870zv71w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nv935716x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Curriculum and Instruction</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:js956m17p</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:11:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In order to analyze the relationship of punk to anarchy, this thesis will investigate the discursive function of "anarchy" both in contemporaneous accounts of punk and in subsequent histories. Beginning with the genesis of British punk and the first references to anarchy in different media during the late 1970s, subsequent chapters focus on the seminally influential anarcho-punk band Crass in order to discern their impact on the evolution of the anarcho-punk genre and its relationship to anarchism up through the mid-1980s. Several other anarcho-punk bands will also be considered for their contributions to this genre. In addition to providing an in-depth study of anarcho-punk, which has been largely ignored by scholars, the present work seeks to enhance understanding of the role of anarchy in punk discourse and hopes to offer a starting point for analysing recent developments in other politicised subcultures.</description><creator>Dymock, Laura.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Punk culture.</subject><subject>Crass (Musical group)</subject><subject>Punk rock music -- History and criticism.</subject><title>No compromise with their society : the politics of anarchy in anarcho-punk, 1977-1985</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Laura Dymock, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vt150p305.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/js956m17p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Schulich School of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z029p8927</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:11:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis consists in a comparison between the novels of Julien Gracq and the magical realism. More precisely, our research's main concern is about the forms of strangeness developed throughout the works of the author. We wish to demonstrate how elements of the texts---space, time, metafiction and intertextuality---generate the appropriate atmosphere for the emergence of magic. We think that, whether or not the representation includes magic, it maintains itself on the edge of the fantastic, partly because the images constantly suggest its imminence. Our intention is thus to prove that the feeling of strangeness that emerges from Gracq's fiction is a latent or embryonic form of magical realism.</description><creator>Giguère, Marielle.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Gracq, Julien, 1910-2007 -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><subject>Magic realism (Literature)</subject><title>Julien Gracq et le réalisme magique</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Marielle Giguère, 2007</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3b591d359.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z029p8927</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xd07gx894</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:11:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis discusses the prospect of integrating vibrotactile feedback into digital musical instruments.

Increased protein accumulation is a key feature of cardiac hypertrophy; thus, our study investigates the effects of a cGMP analog on protein accumulation in primary culture of adult rat cardiomyocytes and dissects out the mechanisms involved. We confirmed that a cGMP analog, 8-bromo-cGMP, inhibits phenylephrine (PE)-increased accumulation of newly synthesized proteins in cultured adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. Firstly, we have obtained data showing that 8-bromo-cGMP does not inhibit phosphorylation of S6K1 by PE during short time treatment (10 min to 2 h), but blocks phosphorylation of S6K1 by PE at 6 h; moreover this blocking effect is completely abolished by phosphatase inhibitor Tautomycin. Then, we have demonstrated that PE and cGMP induce sustained and transient increased phosphorylation of ERK, respectively. Moreover, cGMP inhibits PE-induced phosphorylation of ERK during long term treatment (3 and 6h). We have also shown that 8-bromo-cGMP inhibits ROS generation induced by PE. Other effects of PE that could be related to hypertrophy (i.e. increased concentration of upstream binding factor mRNA and decreased concentration of the mRNAs of Atrogin and muscle specific RING finger) were not abolished by 8-bromo-cGMP. We conclude that cGMP analog blocks protein accumulation by inhibiting the sustained phosphorylation of S6K1 via the activation of phosphatases.</description><creator>Li, Ying, 1972, Mar. 31-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Myocytes, Cardiac -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Proteins -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Cardiomegaly -- etiology.</subject><subject>Cyclic GMP -- analogs &amp; derivatives.</subject><title>The effects of cyclic guanosine 3', 5'-monophosphate analog on protein accumulation in adult rat cardiomyocytes in vitro /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Ying Li, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4q77fw82c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/79408233m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8336h588c</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:11:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurological disease that leads to respiratory compromise and eventually death within two to five years. Even though people with ALS must make many treatment decisions, none has such a significant impact on quality of life and survival as the one pertaining to assisted ventilation. A qualitative research study was undertaken to elicit factors that are pertinent to this decision-making process. Ten individual, semi-structured interviews were conducted with individuals with ALS. Six main themes emerged from the interviews. These are: meaning of the intervention, the importance of context, values, and fears in decision-making, the need for information, and adaptation/acceptance of the intervention. Based on these findings, it is argued that a pluralistic conception of autonomy as well as a shared decision-making model is better suited to give high priority to patient autonomy in this context. Some recommendations to improve clinical practice are proposed.</description><creator>Lemoignan, Josée.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Respiration, Artificial.</subject><subject>Tracheostomy.</subject><subject>Patient Care Planning.</subject><subject>Ventilators, Mechanical.</subject><subject>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis -- therapy.</subject><subject>Consumer Participation.</subject><title>Decision-making for assisted ventilation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Josée Lemoignan, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6682x8001.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8336h588c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:70795d00j</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:11:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Humans routinely make movements to targets that have different accuracy requirements in different directions. Examples extend from everyday occurrences such as grasping the handle of a coffee cup to the more refined instance of a surgeon positioning a scalpel. The attainment of accuracy in situations such as these might rest upon the nervous system's capacity to regulate the limb's resistance to displacement, or impedance. To test this idea, subjects made movements from random starting locations to targets that had shape dependant accuracy requirements. A robotic device was used to assess both limb impedance and patterns of movement variability just as the subject reached the target. Impedance was seen to increase in directions where required accuracy was high. Furthermore, independent of target shape patterns of limb stiffness were seen to predict spatial patterns of movement variability.

We define a system of codimension-1 subspaces in the universal cover, and invoke a construction essentially due to Sageev to define an action of G on a CAT(0) cube complex. By proving easily formulated geometric properties of the codimension-1 subspaces we show that when n ≥ 4 the action is proper and cocompact, and that the cube complex is finite dimensional and locally finite. We also prove partial results when n = 2 or n = 3.

One component of the ECM is the elastic fiber, which confers the property of elasticity to its environment. Organs such as the lung, skin and major blood vessels have an abundance of elastic fibers so that they are able to expand and recoil. Elastic fibers are composed of two main components; elastin and microfibrils. Microfibrils are composed primarily of fibrillin-1 and provide a scaffold unto which tropoelastin monomers assemble. Elastic fibers interact with many other proteins in the ECM, one of which is fibulin-5. Based on the severe elastic fiber defects observed in the fibulin-5 null mouse, it was established that fibulin-5 plays an essential role in elastic fiber development. This role may be in the deposition of tropoelastin onto microfibrils and/or in stabilizing the elastic fibers in the extracellular matrix. In the present study, the relationship between fibulin-5 and the elastic fiber was investigated through a number of in vivo and in vitro experiments. To test the hypothesis that fibulin-5 requires the presence of elastin to assemble in the ECM, full-length recombinant fibulin-5 (rF5) was purified from transfected cells and used to make a fibulin-5 antibody. Solid-phase binding assays using rF5 showed that fibulin-5 binds tropoelastin at two sites; the initial portion of the C-terminus and the first calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like domain at the N-terminus. Immunofluorescence staining of elastin null mouse embryonic fibroblast cultures revealed that fibulin-5 does not require elastin to be present in the ECM in order to assemble. Subsequently, solid-phase binding assays showed that fibulin-5 can bind to the N-terminus of fibrillin-1. To determine if fibulin-5 could exist independent of elastin and/or fibrillin-1 in vivo, an immunohistochemical analysis was conducted on heart, liver, lung, colon, spleen, testis and kidney. All three proteins were co-localized in all organs except in the kidney, where fibrillin-1 was found to independently stain the capillary tufts of the renal corpuscles and renal tubules. Thus, fibulin-5 may be co-regulated with elastin and is not present on elastin-independent microfibrils. Additionally, novel locations of elastic fibers were uncovered in the heart, liver, colon, spleen and testis. Overall, this study provides important insights as to the role of fibulin-5 in elastic fiber structure and assembly and also reveals the complexity in understanding the pathogenesis of diseases involving elastic fiber proteins.</description><creator>Ferron, Florence Joelle.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Elastin.</subject><subject>Extracellular Matrix Proteins.</subject><subject>Elastic Tissue -- ultrastructure.</subject><title>The implications of fibulin-5 on elastin assembly and its role in the elastic fiber /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Florence Joelle Ferron, 2007</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mc87pv62s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h128nj994</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pv63g430d</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:11:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The involvement of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the pathophysiology of anxiety and anxiety-related disorders is well established. The objective of this study is to explore the genetic variations in the CRH and NPY genes in a well-documented behavioral animal model, the vervet monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus), in order to uncover a possible association between these polymorphisms and behavioral traits quantitatively extracted following analysis of social behavior and responses to novelty challenges. The vervet CRH and NPY genes were amplified and sequenced; the priority was given to the regions expanding from -1kb upstream of the transcription initiation site (where most of the regulatory elements are found in both genes) through the second exon. Polymorphism discovery analysis revealed the presence of 9 vervet CRH SNPs and 9 vervet NPY SNPs; the SNPs are relatively evenly distributed across the regions covered. An association between one intronic NPY SNP and "defensive aggression" was detected. These results are coherent with other reports implicating NPY in defensive aggressive behavior, and support the notion that fear responses are fundamental behavioral traits for the dissection of anxiety.</description><creator>Elbejjani, Martine.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Neuropeptide Y -- genetics.</subject><subject>Anxiety Disorders -- genetics.</subject><subject>Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone -- genetics.</subject><subject>Anxiety Disorders -- physiopathology.</subject><title>Dissecting anxiety in the vervet monkey : a search for association between polymorphisms in the corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) genes and anxious behavior</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Martine Elbejjani, 2007</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j098zg27q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pv63g430d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Human Genetics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7m01bq71n</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:11:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this thesis is to report a theoretical investigation on the current-current correlation and noise in the tmnsient quantum transport regime. In particular, we calculate current correlations when the bias voltage of a LDL quantum device is suddenly turned off. Namely, we consider the situation that when time t &lt; 0 the device is in a steady-state under bias Vb, when t &gt; 0 the bias is turned off to zero. Under such a bias, the transport current l goes from a finite steady-state value 10 at t &lt; 0 to zero at large times. When electronic structure of the leads as well as well as the device scattering region are to be taken into account, it is a difficult problem to calculate the time dependent current-current correlation. However, for the sharp step-down bias shape, we discover that the time-dependent problem can be solved exactly for non-interacting systems.</description><creator>Feng, Zi Min, 1982-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Mesoscopic phenomena (Physics)</subject><subject>Quantum electronics -- Mathematics.</subject><subject>Transport theory -- Mathematics.</subject><subject>Green's functions.</subject><title>Current fluctuations driven by a sudden turn-off of external bias</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Zi Min Feng, 2007</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3197xq83t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7m01bq71n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3n204328m</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:11:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The potential of grain amaranth production in southwestern Quebec was studied. Twenty-nine cultivars were evaluated in single row plots, and seven in mechanically managed plots. Yields averaged 27 g plant-1 in single row plots, and 649 kg ha-1 in mechanically managed plots. Another set of experiments evaluated different seeding dates, row spacings, seeding rates and nitrogen fertilization rates. Seeding date and nitrogen fertilization affected grain yield in one environment, and seeding rate and row spacing did not affect yield. Grains in all experiments required drying. These experiments suggest that grain amaranth could be cultivated in southwestern Quebec. Oxalate concentration and form were determined in seeds from the cultivar, seeding date and nitrogen fertilization trials, and the effects of cooking on oxalate were evaluated. Fertilization increased oxalate concentration, seeding date had no effects, and cooking increased soluble oxalate. Grain amaranth is high in oxalate, but its absorbability is probably low.</description><creator>Gélinas, Bruce.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Grain amaranths -- Québec (Province).</subject><title>Potential of grain amaranth production in eastern Canada</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Bruce Gélinas, 2007</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5d86p461n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3n204328m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Plant Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2b88qh42x</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:11:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Afin d'étudier la formation et la croissance de bulle; sous pression d'une atmosphère, desexpériences de dégazage sur un basalte de Stromboli, avec HiO ou H20 + CO2 dissouts,ont été exécutées dans un four pilote sous rayonnement synchrotron à l'APS (AdvancedPhoton Source).

The glasses were synthesized at 1250°C and 1000 MPa, with ~3.0 wt%, ~5.0 wt%, or ~7.0 wt% H2O or with mixtures of H2O + CO2, ~3.0 wt% H2O and ~440 ppm CO2, ~5.0 wt% H2O and 880 ppm CO2, ~7.0 wt% H2O and ~1480 ppm CO2, then heated on the beamline while recording the bubble growth. The 3D bubble size distributions in the quenched samples were then studied with synchrotron X-ray microtomography. The experimental results show that bubble nucleation and growth are volatile-concentration dependent. Bubbles can easily nucleate in melts initially containing high volatile concentrations. CO2 has no significant effect on bubble formation and growth because of low CO2 concentrations. Multiple nucleation events occur in most of these degassing samples, and they are more pronounced in more supersaturated melts. Bubble growth is initially controlled by viscosity near glass transition temperatures and by diffusion at higher temperatures where melt viscous relaxation occurs rapidly. Bubble foam forms when bubbles are highly connected due to coalescence, and bubbles begin pop, 10 to 20 seconds after the foam is developed. The degree of bubble coalescence increases with time, and bubble coalescence can significantly change the bubble size distribution. Bubble size distributions follow power-law relations at vesicularities of 1.0% to 65%, and bubble size distributions evolve from power-law relations to exponential relations at vesicularities of 65% to 83%. This evolution is associated with the change from far-from-equilibrium degassing to near-equilibrium degassing. The experimental results imply that during basaltic eruptions both far-from-equilibrium degassing and near-equilibrium degassing can occur. The far-from-equilibrium degassing generally generates the power-law bubble size distributions whereas the near-equilibrium degassing produces exponential bubble size distributions Bubbles begin to pop when the vesicularities attain 65% to 83%. Bubble expansion in the foam possibly accounts for the mechanism of magma fragmentation.</description><creator>Bai, Liping.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Volcanic gases.</subject><subject>Basalt -- Italy -- Stromboli.</subject><subject>Volcanic eruptions.</subject><title>Experimental study of bubble growth in Stromboli basalt melts at 1 atmosphere</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Liping Bai, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7s75dh64z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2b88qh42x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:f7623h78b</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:11:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The protection regimes (international human rights law, international criminal law and international humanitarian law) are true expressions of the utopian ideals of the international community in trying to deal with mass human rights violations and atrocities. These expressions, however, can create hierarchies in the protection that is awarded and in a sense create categories of exclusion, rather than categories of protection. The subaltern outside these categories, the one that is not protected must be recognized. By using the definition of genocide, more specifically the mental component conceptualised in the Genocide Convention, the aim of this paper is to argue that the protection awarded is limited and therefore exclusionary. Starting from this premise, the question is whether the restrictive nature of the wording can be expanded using the tools of interpretation within international law. Drawing from the large corpus of legal tools, the aim of this paper is to show that there are ways to expand the categories in international criminal law, one of which is the idea of progressive development of the law. The Rome Statute and certain fundamental principles of international human rights law provide pillars of support to this argument. However, in trying to expand the categories of protection that is awarded, the rights of the alleged perpetrator must be taken into account and the Principle of Legality must be respected. Within this contextual paralysis, the meta critique needs to be situated: That the fundamental aim of the crimes of all crimes is to protect the weak and helpless. Therefore, the philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas will be used to argue that the creation of priorities of protection cannot stand, as it does not recognize the other, rather only those that have become part of the self.</description><creator>Xavier, Sujith.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>International offenses.</subject><subject>Genocide.</subject><subject>Human rights.</subject><title>Categories of protection or categories of exclusion in international criminal law : can the subaltern finally speak?</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Sujith Xavier, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nv935718g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f7623h78b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pz50h160c</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:11:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In order to market and sell a new pharmaceutical drug in Canada, the Minister of Health requires the initial applicant to submit clinical test results demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective for human use. Subsequent applicants, who typically lack the resources to conduct expensive clinical trials, must refer to and rely upon the initial applicant's data in their applications to market a generic version of the drug. On June 17, 2006, the federal government of Canada published a proposed data protection regulation, which would provide an initial applicant with eight years of protection for clinical test results submitted in a new drug submission. This protection would lead to an eight year period of market exclusivity for the drug associated with the clinical test data, regardless of whether that drug was protected by a Canadian patent. In this thesis, the author first describes what data protection is on a practical level, and distinguishes data protection from other forms of intellectual property rights. Next, the author discusses how various jurisdictions choose to protect clinical test data submitted to their health authorities. Canada's international obligations pursuant to the NAFTA and the TRIPS Agreement are also examined. In this regard, the author argues that Canada is under no obligation to provide initial applicants with eight years of data protection. Furthermore, the author argues that exclusive time-limited property rights in clinical test data are difficult to justify from a theoretical perspective. Finally, the author prescribes certain legislative changes to Canada's proposed data protection regulation.</description><creator>Stoddard, Damon.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Data protection -- Law and legislation.</subject><subject>Data protection -- Law and legislation -- Canada.</subject><subject>Drug development -- Canada.</subject><subject>Drugs -- Law and legislation -- Canada.</subject><title>A new Canadian intellectual property right : the protection of data submitted for marketing approval of pharmaceutical drugs</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Damon Stoddard, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8049g914j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pz50h160c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zg64tr144</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:11:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Nearly fifty years have passed since the beginning of the space age, but international lawmakers have yet to determine where airspace ends and outer space begins.

Yet this minority group experiences deplorable living conditions and the survival of its culture is endangered. A study of minority protection mechanisms in international law reveals that the grasp of territory and "sedentarism" has far from disappeared from this branch of law. Territory (or the absence thereof) and movement are the main challenges faced by international law in the development of solutions to the situation of the Roma and the Travellers. In light of the failure of current minority protection regimes, the quest for recognition of a "Roma nation" appears to be an avenue worth exploring. However, while the Roma may not fall clearly within the parameters of minority protection, they do not fall clearly within the concept of nation either. When examining the potential of such recognition, one realizes that it is necessary to redefine the right of self-determination in the context of minority protection and in a transnational and non-territorial perspective.</description><creator>Latulippe, Chloé.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Self-determination, National.</subject><subject>Romanies -- Legal status, laws, etc.</subject><subject>Minorities -- Legal status, laws, etc.</subject><subject>Human rights.</subject><title>Territoire, mouvement et protection des minorités en droit international : le cas des Roms et des Gens du voyage</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Chloé Latulippe, 2007</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d791sm425.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gt54ks28k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:v979v682g</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:11:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The granting of a range of discretionary powers to the franchisor shows the hierarchical face, besides the market or contractual face, of franchising and similar networks. Dealing with power-related contractual problems within these arrangements is particularly challenging, since they occupy a little explored niche in legal reasoning. In this thesis, I develop an interdisciplinary inquiry on the network concept to assess to which extent it reveals the rationalities underlying the granting of such powers. I study the typical contract law categories of control of the exercise of individual prerogatives available both in civil law and in common law tradition. I discuss to which extent those categories are capable of controlling the exercise of discretionary powers in franchise disputes. I finally turn to public law reasoning on control of power and propose a prudent transplant of some elements of this reasoning into contract law discourse.</description><creator>Ludwig, Marcos de Campos.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Franchises (Retail trade) -- Law and legislation.</subject><subject>Contracts.</subject><title>Dealing with power in contract : a proposal of criteria for controlling the exercise of discretionary powers in franchising</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Marcos de Campos Ludwig, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j96025073.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v979v682g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h989r7462</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:11:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In 1998 the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the "OECD") commenced a campaign to eliminate harmful tax competition focusing on geographically mobile activities. The OECD targeted 35 jurisdictions and demanded that those nations amend their tax laws to remove the harmful features that provided more favorable tax treatment to geographically mobile capital than was available in some of its Member States. This thesis examines the international responsibility of the OECD and its Member States to determine whether their conduct in waging this campaign is in accordance with the international legal principles of state sovereignty and non-intervention. As an international actor with legal personality, the conduct of the OECD is found to engage its international responsibility for the breach of state sovereignty and non-intervention. The Member States in support of the OECD's actions are found to have primary and secondary responsibility under international law for the OEOD's actions.</description><creator>Nikolakakis, Niki.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>International agencies.</subject><subject>Sovereignty.</subject><subject>Taxation -- Law and legislation.</subject><title>The international legal ramifications of the OECD's harmful tax competition crusade /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Niki Nikolakakis, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3n204329w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h989r7462</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):41750</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
