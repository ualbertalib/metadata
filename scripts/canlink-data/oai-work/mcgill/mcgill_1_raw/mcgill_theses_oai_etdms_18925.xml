These authors claimed that a commercial cellulose "dinitrate" ( N, 11.9% ) yielded an acetylide which retained a small amount of nitrate groups and also contained amino groups derived from by-product sodamide. Segall, in a Ph.D. thesis submitted to this University in 1946, showed that hydroxylamlne or O-methyl hydroxylamine in pyridine reacted with cellulose trinitrate in pyridine to yield a white fibrous material approximating cellulose dinitrate in composition, and which was unusually stable to bases.</description><creator>Moulds, Gordon.

Indeed, so great have been these changes that much effort has been made to clarify the present function of the family and much speculation has been voiced as to its future. The beginning of the 19th century saw the family on this continent as an almost self-sufficient social and economic unit. Gradually, however, its many functions were taken over by other institutions; education by the school, religious guidance by the church, the manufacture of personal and household goods by the factories, recreation by the community centres.

The same concept is of value in the study of the convergence of iterative procedures in matrix computation in setting limits of error. Subject to restrictions of a rather broad nature, which will be investigated in the sequel, the definition of a norm in terms of the elements of a matrix is arbitrary. As a consequence several definitions of a norm of a matrix have been proposed, the most widely used being that of Wedderburn [10,11].</description><creator>Melamed, Samuel.</creator><contributor>Kaufman, H.

Chapter 2 describes new annulations catalyzed by gold(I) of simple 0-hydroxyaldehydes with alkynes. This annulation efficiently generates isoflavanone-type structures, which have many possible applications in the synthesis of isoflavanone natural products. This chapter details the development and the optimization of the reaction conditions. The annulation was applied to various aldehydes and arylalkynes with good efficiency. Furthermore, it incorporated all atoms of both starting materials into the product and thus has a theoretical atom economy of 100%. Chapter 3 extends the scope of the annulations developed in Chapter 2. Indeed, 2,3-dihydro-l-tosylquinolin-3(1H)-one derivatives, aza-isoflavanones, have been efficiently synthesized via a gold-catalyzed annulation of 2-tosylaminobenzaldehyde and alkynes. The annulation was applied to various arylalkynes with good efficiency. This annulation can be used for the synthesis of a range of potentially bioactive molecules.

It was noted that the number of chronically ill aged patients being hospitalized vas steadily increasing resulting in a large number of discharge problems demanding skilled planning. Evaluating whether an aged patient may return to his home and family, or whether he must be placed outside of the home, accounted for a substantial part of the social worker's time and attention.

These oxidative processes do not proceed in the living tissues in spite of the presence of complicated oxidation - reduction systems in the cell; this fact is ordinarily ascribed to the maintenance of a highly specific state of organization of these systems in the living cell.

One of the most recently developed therapies is the surgical treatment of mental disorder.

Some of these experiences have been pleasant, others have been arduous, a few have been considered as chores but rarely has a committee membership been accounted an activity of such worth as to lead to an increase in personal knowledge and enhancement within the profession. Having been an active participant in numerous committees and having had an advisory relationship to others, one is sometimes inclined to agree with the anonymous wit who believed that 'the best committee is that one which consists of a good chairman and two members, the latter being absent.'

When it was realized that the complex analysis rests heavily upon the concept of the "absolute value" which in turn could be characterized axiomatically as a certain valuation satisfying the weak triangle law it became evident that other valuations could also be used to construct analogues of the classical function theory. As, Ostrowski 12 had showed there are essentially two types of valuations: archimedean and nonarchimedian. [...]</description><creator>Linis-Linins, Viktors.</creator><contributor>Zassenhaus, H.

Most frequently a monograph is presented, a ease study documenting the economic possibililities and making definite policy recommendations for a given country.
