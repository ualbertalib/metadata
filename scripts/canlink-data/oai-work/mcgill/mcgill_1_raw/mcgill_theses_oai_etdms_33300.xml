Although governments assigned women secondary roles as dependants and 'followers' in the migration process, I argue that Italian women were central, not marginal, to the migration and settlement experiences of Italian immigrants. By placing Italian women front and centre of this study, I contribute to a small but growing body of work that challenges the male-centred perspective of most literature on Italian-Canadian and Italian-Australian migration and ethnicity. This thesis is structured within a feminist framework and uses interdisciplinary methods to gather and interpret quantitative and qualitative information about the lives of Italian immigrant women in post-war Canada and Australia. Using government and church archives, personal interviews, ethnic newspapers, legal documents, marriage registers and participant observer fieldwork, I explore three major themes. Firstly, I examine Italian immigrant women's understanding of power relations within their homes and workplaces. Rather than cast women as either passive victims or all-conquering heroines, I present the complexity of the sources of power and weakness in immigrant women's lives. I argue that Italian immigrant women had to cope with exploitation and disadvantage because of their class, gender and ethnic status. However, they responded to these challenges with resistance and resilience, and were able to affect change and wield power within certain constraints. Secondly, I compare the experiences of migration and settlement for Italian immigrant women in Canada and Australia and show how women's experiences were united by common gender concerns. I found overwhelming similarities between the family lives and work experiences of Italian-Canadian and Italian-Australian immigrant women, and in the government policies and programs that attempted to direct their migration and settlement in the post-war period. Finally, I examine how Italian immigrant women helped to construct what it means to be 'Italian' in post-war Canada and Australia. I show how gender roles assigned to, and chosen by, Italian-Canadian and Italian-Australian women, served as boundary markers for ethnic difference. Perceived differences in attitudes towards waged work, mothering, family responsibilities and sexuality were used by Italian immigrant women to distinguish themselves as members of an ethnic collective.</description><creator>Iuliano, Susanna</creator><contributor>Zucchi, John (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Italian-Canadian women</subject><subject>Women immigrants -- Australia</subject><subject>Women immigrants -- Canada</subject><title>Sebben che siamo donne (although we are women) : a comparative study of Italian immigrant women in post-war Canada and Australia</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8p58pf568.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p8418p85m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0p0968697</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:38:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>While plate tectonic theory has been developed considerably in the last four decades, the of initiation of subduction remains an enigma. In this thesis, I investigate the possible initiation of subduction of North Atlantic oceanic lithosphere at the Scotian basin off east coast of Canada. On the basis of the relationships between topography, gravity and magnetic anomalies, in both space and Fourier domains, a crustal model is proposed to explain the long- and intermediate-wavelength components of the gravity anomalies of eastern Canada which takes into account the topography, density perturbations in the crust and upper mantle and Moho undulation with certain degree of compensation. No pronounced correlation is observed between the reduced-to-pole magnetic anomalies and topography, as well as between the magnetic anomalies and the vertical gradient of gravity anomalies. The low magnetic susceptibility beneath suture zones indicates thermal demagnetization of the high-magnetic crustal root. The above topography and gravity analysis method is used to determine the compensation state of the Scotian basin. A 3-D density model that incorporates seawater, sediments, oceanic and continental crust and the lithosphere down to 35 km depth is established, which together with density perturbations inside the crust and mantle of the model, produce the observed gravity anomalies. Regional compensation is required to explain the observations. A 2-D thin elastic plate model is adopted to investigate the flexural response of the lithosphere subjected to the loads due to the sediments and excess density perturbations. The rigidity of the lithosphere beneath the basin is estimated to be about one to two orders of magnitude smaller than elsewhere. The weakening is due to thermal blanketing effects of the thick sediments and the temperature-dependent rheology of lithosphere. The weak lithosphere would have a controlling effect on reactivation of normal faults at the ocean-continent boundary. The possible re-orientation of the spreading ridge of North Atlantic ocean may produce tensional stresses that would decouple the oceanic lithosphere from the continental one at the weak zone, allowing the lithosphere beneath the basin to bend more. Subduction initiation would be facilitated when taking into account further weakening of the lithosphere by extra sediments and subsequent compression.

Magnetic measurements were performed with a custom built vacuum magnetic force microscopy with in-situ in plane magnetic fields. The MFM has been optimized with a force gradient sensitivity as high as 1 x 10-6 N/m. By using various magnetic tips, operating in different modes, and studying different samples, the effect of the magnetic tip stray field induced distortion of the magnetic state of a submicron sized magnet is presented. Through the systematic study, a method of how to detect and to avoid these irreversible distortions is also presented. A local 'hysteresis loop' technique has been invented to study the abrupt switching behavior of individual elements. In arrays of elongated magnetic particle array, the aspect ratio dependence of the switching indicates that the vortex state can be trapped inside the elements and form an energetic stable state, leading to a broad switching field distribution. In an array of 70 nm wide pseudo spin valve elements, parallel and antiparallel single domain configurations are found. Major and minor hysteresis loops as well as inter-layer coupling are investigated. We found that interlayer coupling leads to switching field variations. In a Permalloy disk array, the vortex state with vortex core singularity is found. The switching mechanism through the nucleation and annihilation processes is demonstrated by the local hysteresis loop. An interdot coupling-induced anisotropic switching is observed. In Permalloy ring structures, a vortex state and an 'onion' state are found. The onion state in permalloy rings with diameters of 5mum is found to be a flux closure state with a head to head domain wall. The switching behavior of these ring elements is found to be domain wall propagation.</description><creator>Zhu, Xiaobin, 1972-</creator><contributor>Grutter, Peter (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Physics, Condensed Matter.</subject><title>Magnetic force microscopy studies of submicron and nanoscale magnet arrays</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5h73px64x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jm214q693</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nc580p18m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:38:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Artificial cells microencapsulation have a number of potential areas of application. Studies showed that lowering of tyrosine level could inhibit the growth of melanoma. However, at present there is no practical method to lower the tyrosine level in humans. We have therefore devised novel methods as follows. (1) Microencapsulation of tyrosinase for the removal of systemic tyrosine by oral administration. Characterization, optimization, and feasibility studies were carried out to test the therapeutic potentials. In temperature and pH studies, the encapsulated tyrosinase maintained higher enzyme activity than the free enzyme in solution. The in vivo studies showed that daily oral administration of encapsulated tyrosinase by itself for about 3--5 days could lower the body tyrosine level. (2) A novel polyhemoglobin-tyrosinase preparation for intravenous injection can rapidly lower the body tyrosine level after one intravenous injection. In this form, the enzyme is covered by hemoglobin molecules and therefore has less immunological properties. Furthermore, polyhemoglobin is an oxygen carrier and being in a solution, it can more readily reach the narrower capillaries of the melanoma cancer cells than red blood cells and can therefore bring more oxygen for radiation therapy. Our in vitro studies showed that this novel polyhemoglobin-tyrosinase preparation inhibited the growth of melanoma cells in culture. (3) A combination of two intravenous injections of polyhemoglobin-tyrosinase with 3 times a day oral administration of encapsulated tyrosinase could immediately lower the body tyrosine and maintained this low level as long as the oral administration was continued.</description><creator>Yu, Binglan, 1971-</creator><contributor>Chang, T.

Hume intended to criticize traditional metaphysics by referring all knowledge to experience. But it is almost always assumed that Hume means by "experience" the result of an individual's past sense perception or personal observation. Accordingly, Hume's criticism of traditional metaphysics is taken to lead to an individualistic conception of knowledge and human nature. In this thesis I claim that this picture of Hume's "empiricism" is simply wrong. He is not a philosopher who reduces "experience" to the merely private happenings within a personal psychology. On the contrary, Hume has a wider notion of experience, one that includes not only personal observation and memory, but, fundamentally, one that includes implicit knowledge of human history. Experience, so understood, brings about what I term a historical point of view, namely, the point of view of someone who seeks to extend his experience as far as it is possible in order to acquire the capacity to produce more nuanced and impartial judgments in any given practice. It is precisely this historical point of view that enables us to depart from the individualistic perspective that we would otherwise be bound to adopt not only in epistemology but, most significantly, in politics, in social life, in religion, etc. Chapter 1 presents the historical background against which Hume elaborates his views of history's role in philosophy. Chapter 2 discusses and criticizes the individualist reading of Hume by showing that he had a satisfactory account of beliefs formed via human testimony. Chapter 3 presents a view of Hume on explanation that underscores his interest in practical and informal explanations as those of history. Chapter 4 provides a discussion of Hume's notion of historical experience in relation both to his theory of perception and to his project of a "science of man."</description><creator>Perinetti, Dario</creator><contributor>Fate, David (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Hume, David, 1711-1776</subject><subject>History -- Philosophy -- History -- 18th century</subject><subject>Knowledge, Theory of -- History -- 18th century.</subject><title>Hume, history and the science of human nature</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8049g666p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9593tw774</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Philosophy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k35696084</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:38:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The development of reflexive and voluntary shifts of visual attention, as well as relations between the two forms of shifting was examined in three groups of children (5-, 7-, and 9-years-old), one group of young adults (24-years-old), and two groups of senior adults (young seniors: 69-years-old, old seniors: 81-years-old). The task entailed the detection and response to the presentation of a target (black dot) in one of four possible locations in the visual field. The dependent measure was reaction time (RT). The extent to which flash cues facilitated or inhibited reflexive orienting was determined through presentation of nonpredictive abrupt onset peripheral flash cues prior to the target. Arrow facilitation and inhibition was measured by shifts of attention initiated in response to predictive central arrow cues. Relations between reflexive and voluntary shifts of attention were gauged by the degree to which flash and arrow facilitation and inhibition were observed in response to the presentation of both arrow and flash cues together in one trial. Conditions varied with regard to the validity of the location cues (accurate or inaccurate information regarding the location of the subsequent target) and the length of the interval between the cue and the target (SOA: 185 or 875 ms). All age groups demonstrated flash facilitation with the flash cue alone, demonstrating similar patterns of reflexive orienting across the lifespan. However, the three groups of children demonstrated the largest flash cue effects suggesting that they had the most difficulty ignoring the nonpredictive flash cues. With the arrow cue alone, young adults, and young and old senior adults were more efficient (faster RTs) in their execution of voluntary shifts, however, all age groups utilized the arrow cues to orient attention strategically and in doing so experienced similar patterns of arrow facilitation.

Its protein expression is regulated at the translational level, as its mRNA shifts from ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes to polyribosomes upon growth factor stimulation. The regulation of this shift is mediated by a terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) element in the 5' untranslated region (UTR), of the eEF1A-1 mRNA. This shifting is also involved during differentiation and mammalian development. During development the expression of eEF1A-1 declines and eEF1A-2, a highly conserved homologue, becomes the dominant eEF1A isoform expressed in brain, heart, and skeletal muscle. In this thesis, three studies were undertaken to examine the regulation and involvement of eEF1A-1 and eEF1A-2 in protein synthesis in neurons. In the first study, the steady-state expression of eEF1A-1 and eEF1A-2 mRNAs and proteins was studied during retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation of P19 embryonic teratocarcinoma cells. The decline of eEF1A-1 and the increase in eEF1A-2 expression during neuronal differentiation were found to be regulated primarily at the transcriptional level, since there was a correlation between the levels of mRNA and protein expression. In differentiated P19 neurons translational repression of eEF1A-1 mRNA also contributed to the decrease of eEF1A-1 protein. This indicated that transcriptional and translational repression of eEF1A-1 mRNA occurred during neuronal differentiation. Unlike eEF1A-1, eEF1A-2 mRNA was associated primarily with polyribosomes, suggesting that eEFIA-2 is preferentially translated during P19 neuronal differentiation. In the second study, the eEF1A-1 isoform was shown to be preferentially synthesized in nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulated PC12 cells. The increased synthesis of eEF1A-1 was mediated at the translational level, as shown by the shifting of eEF1A-1 mRNA to polyribosomes after NGF stimula</description><creator>Petroulakis, Emmanuel</creator><contributor>Wang, Eugenia (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Distinct mechanisms of translation of members of the mammalian elongation factor family, eEF1A-1 and eEF1A-2, during neuronal differentiation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cf95jc96r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kk91fn36c</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ks65hd80g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:38:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Quality of life is a key issue in disabling conditions like stroke. Unfortunately, quality of life is often difficult to quantify in a comprehensive measure that can be used in cost analyses. Preference-based health status measures meet this challenge. A health outcome generated by a preference-based measure is assigned one single value that captures and weighs the various losses and gains on the different attributes or domains covered by the measure. Possible scores on a preference-based measure range from 0 (worst possible health state) to 1 (best possible health state). As there is no existing preference-based health status measure specific for stroke, this doctoral project aimed to develop one for use as an outcome in clinical and economic studies of stroke. Several steps were required to develop the Preference-based Stroke Index (PBSI), a 10-item comprehensive measure of health status post-stroke. In order to ensure high content validity, major efforts were placed to select items that were known to be impacted by a stroke and had been identified by stroke survivors as important to their health-related quality of life (HRQoL). A pilot study among long-term stroke survivors indicated good discriminative ability of the PBSI. Scaling properties and preference-weights obtained from individuals with stroke and their caregivers were used to develop a temporary summative score. There is evidence of convergent validity of the PBSI with the SF-36. Construct validation of the PBSI showed that the PBSI was able to differentiate HRQoL of individuals with stroke according to their level of functional independence and to their stroke severity at onset. The development of a multiattribute utility function will need to be undertaken in the near future for further refinement of the PBSI.</description><creator>Poissant, Lise</creator><contributor>Mayo, Nancy E.

Seventy 8.5-month-old infants were randomly assigned to one of four experiments conducted on the Headturn Preference Procedure. The first experiment examined infants' preferences for Prelude and Forlane in piano timbre. The second experiment assessed infants' preferences for Prelude and Forlane in orchestra timbre. Infants' preferences for the Forlane in piano and orchestra timbres were investigated in the third experiment. The last experiment aimed at infants' long-term memory for complex music. Thirty infants were exposed to either the Prelude or the Forlane three times a day for ten consecutive days. Two weeks following the exposure, infants were tested on the HPP. It was predicted that these infants would prefer to listen to the familiar piece from the exposure over the unfamiliar one. Results suggested that 8.5-month-olds could tell apart two complex pieces of music in orchestra timbre and could discriminate between the piano and the orchestra timbres. Contrary to the belief that infants are ill equipped to process complex music, this study found that infants could encode and remember complex pieces of music for at least two weeks. Because infants rely on their caretakers to provide musical experiences for them, maternal beliefs and uses of music were also investigated. Mothers of participating infants were interviewed on musical background, listening preferences and musical behaviors and beliefs with their infants. The analysis of interview data yielded the following main results: (1) Singing was the primary musical activity of mothers and babies; (2) Maternal occupation and previous musical experiences affected their musical behaviors with their babies; (3) Most mothers held the belief that there is appropriate music for babies to listen to although there was no consensus as to what is appropriate music. Such beliefs reflect a conflict between maternal beliefs regarding infants' music cognition and the actual music-related perceptual and cognitive abilities of infants. Attempting to attenuate this conflict, suggestions for music educators, parents and researchers were proposed.</description><creator>Ilari, Beatriz Senoi</creator><contributor>Polka, Linda (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Costa-Giomi, Eugenia (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Musical perception in children</subject><title>Music cognition in infancy : infants' preferences and long-term memory for complex music</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ws859h23z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/736666162</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:765372758</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:38:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The entorhinal cortex occupies an important anatomical position in the temporal lobe as the interface between the hippocampus and the neocortex. Its superficial cell layers funnel the cortical input into the hippocampus while the deep layer V is the major target of hippocampal output, which it then directs back to the cortex. This connectivity alone makes the entorhinal cortex a crucial element in what is known as the neocortical-hippocampal-neocortical circuit, a system involved in the long-term storage of "declarative" memories. However, the detailed analysis of the morphological and electrophysiological characteristics of cells in entorhinal cortex layer V had not been carried out, information that is necessary to understand how this cortical layer may participate in the processing of cortically directed hippocampal information. The main goal of the present study was thus to carry out by means of intracellular recording and labelling in a "in vitro" rat entorhinal cortex slice preparation an extensive characterization of the intrinsic electrophysiological characteristics of entorhinal cortex layer V principal neurons in correlation with their morphological attributes. Our main working hypothesis was that electrophysiologically, similar to the neocortex, layer V principal neurons in both the medial and lateral subdivisions of the entorhinal cortex would constitute a heterogeneous population comprised of regularly spiking cells and intrinsically bursting neurons. We found layer V of the entorhinal cortex to be comprised of three main cellular subtypes, pyramidal, horizontal and polymorphic neurons, that were electrophysiologically non-distinguishable. Cells in both medial and lateral entorhinal areas had similar morphological and electrophysiological properties. No intrinsically bursting neurons were encountered; instead, cells were classified as regular spiking neurons with varying spike-frequency adaptation.

More specifically, the relations among self-reported familial, emotional, social, and behavioral variables and youth gambling problems were investigated. The current study also sought to identify risk factors that may be related to youth problem gambling. Participants consisted of 2,336 students in grades 7 to 13 (ages 12 to 19) recruited from various elementary and high schools in the Province of Ontario. Participants completed a questionnaire regarding gambling activities (GAQ), gambling severity (DSM-IV-MR-J), perceived social support (PSS Friend and Family), drug and alcohol dependence (PESQ), and various social, emotional, cognitive, behavioral, and attentional problems (CASS:L). With respect to gambling severity as assessed by the DSM-IV-MR-J gambling screen, 4.9% of adolescents were found to be probable pathological gamblers, and 8.0% at-risk gamblers. The results identified a multitude of problems experienced by problem gamblers. These risk factors for problem gambling include academic difficulties, poor perceived familial and peer social support, cognitive problems, emotional problems, substance use problems, conduct problems, family problems, parental involvement in gambling and substances, and ADHD and related symptoms, particularly inattention. The magnitude of problems and psychopathology that are reported by probable pathological gamblers and at-risk problem gamblers demonstrates that these individuals are experiencing difficulties and are likely using their gambling to escape their problems. The current study also enabled the identification of a set of predictor variables which lead to problem gambling, including having family problems, conduct problems, being addicted to drugs or alcohol, and being male. These findings are interpreted with respect to their implications for the development of risk reduction prevent</description><creator>Hardoon, Karen</creator><contributor>Derevensky, Jeffrey L.

The focus is on motion verbs appearing with a prepositional/postpositional phrase that expresses the final endpoint of the motion (goal PP). In English, manner-of-motion verbs (e.g., walk ) and directed motion verbs (e.g., go) can appear with a goal PP as in John walked (went ) to school. In contrast, Japanese allows only directed motion verbs to occur with a goal PP. Thus, Japanese motion verbs with goal PPs form a subset of their English counterparts. I propose an analysis of these crosslinguistic differences in terms of different incorporation patterns in lexical-syntax (Hale &amp; Keyser, 1993). L1 transfer and learnability considerations (White, 1991b), then, lead me to hypothesize that Japanese-speaking learners of English will be able to acquire the L2 representation on the basis of positive evidence, but that English-speaking learners of Japanese will have difficulty acquiring the L2 representation due to the lack of positive data motivating the restructuring of the L1 representation to the L2. A series of experiments tested these hypotheses using grammaticality judgment and picture-matching tasks. Results in general supported this prediction, suggesting that whether the L1 constitutes a subset of the L2 or vice versa indeed affects the outcomes of L2 argument structure. The results indicate full involvement of L1 and UG in L2 acquisition, thus supporting the Full-Transfer/Full-Access model of L2 acquisition (Schwartz &amp; Sprouse, 1994).</description><creator>Inagaki, Shunji</creator><contributor>White, Lydia (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Japanese language -- Locative constructions</subject><subject>Second language acquisition -- Cross-cultural studies</subject><subject>English language -- Locative constructions</subject><subject>Japanese language -- Verb</subject><subject>Language transfer (Language learning)</subject><title>Transfer and learnability in second language argument structure : motion verbs with locationaldirectional PPs in L2 English and Japanese</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tx31qk386.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t148fj77k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Linguistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6395w911w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:38:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Following on recent interests in social sciences for the development of aquaculture and the alternative management of fisheries, this study shows how the analysis of social and knowledge relations among State-managers, fisheries scientists and local producers helps to better understand the issues at stake in the development and management of coastal resources, and therefore to better identify if a specific cultural setting is suited or not, under its current conditions, for the implementation of a shared management of resources between the State and local organizations. An examination of the recent evolution of the Mexican fisheries sector indicates that the political economic transformations that have characterized the country over the past twenty years have not only affected rural communities in a very profound way, but have also stimulated a rapid growth of shrimp farming activities in coastal areas, and more particularly on the North coast of the state of Nayarit. However, this expansion of shrimp aquaculture has generated many conflicts over the use of and access to natural resources. A closer look at this situation reveals that it is associated with power relationships among all the social actors involved, and intimately related to political interests extending well beyond the local level. The analysis of this case study also demonstrates that conflicting dynamics are fostered by unequal knowledge relations among all the actors involved. In such a context, a complete redefinition of the relationships among State-managers, fisheries scientists and local producers is required for the implementation of any co-management initiative, and anthropologists can contribute to increased visibility of local producers within the decision-making process and fisheries science.</description><creator>Bouret, Pierre</creator><contributor>Scott, Colin H.

The current thesis investigated this mosaicism in greater detail. It characterized the mosaicism present at each stage of preimplantation development in vitro. It examined the relevance of the different forms of the observed mosaicism to preimplantation embryo wastage, implantation failure, and fetal and placental mosaicism. Finally, it addressed the identification of the chromosomally mosaic embryos during preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). For each of the studies presented within the thesis, blastomeres from "spare" in vitro generated embryos were assessed for chromosomal content using multi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) DNA probes. Mosaicism was detected at all stages of preimplantation development, from the 2-cell stage to the blastocyst stage; it comprised of diploid, aneuploid, "chaotic", haploid, and polyploid chromosome patterns. Compared to blastocysts, arrested embryos or embryos at the earlier stages of development, showed a much higher incidence of mosaicism involving "chaotic" imbalances for multiple chromosomes and/or high percentages of abnormal cells. These results indicate that extensive post-zygotic abnormalities impair embryonic development to the blastocyst stage. The presence of mosaicism was not predicted by embryo morphology. Mosaicism may therefore contribute to the low rates of blastocyst formation in vitro and to the high rates of implantation failure following cleavage stage embryo transfer. Probe mixtures comprising of three autosomes, of one autosome and gonosomes, or of five autosomes could be applied for the identification of the mosaic embryos during cleavage stage PGD. Culture of isolated blastomeres from cleavage stage embryos for genetic diagnosis increases the number of cells available for analysis; however, the presence of nuclear defects and mosaicism among the cultured cells indica</description><creator>Bielanska, Magdalena M.</creator><contributor>Tan, S.

Whether they manifest, in their writings, a will to destroy it (Voltaire, Helvetius, d'Holbach, etc.) or to surpass it (Leroux, Lamennais, Hugo, etc.), all refer to its dogmas as a paradigm of argumentation from which they suggest a new explanation of the world and, most important, they all propose a transformation of the society. The goal of my thesis is to offer a new analysis of this period that spreads from 1750 to 1848. In my hypothesis, I stipulate that before 1789, the philosophers of the Enlightenment never undertook a real "de-Christianisation" and that at the turn of the century, the writers did not return exactly to Christianity. Far from taking the position that the argumentation had transformed itself in a manner that radically differed during this historical period that preceded and followed the French Revolution, my goal is to show that a same will to ameliorate the human condition on earth was manifested in comparable ways throughout these different discourses. The thought of these authors is rather a testimony of a new "sacralisation" of which finality is now on a temporal level: sin is not necessary and, more importantly, it is possible to abolish it through social reformations. This desire of a better world is the most important message that Christianity passed on to the thinkers of this period. By viewing human existence in this way, modernity could be defined not as the end, but rather as the inheritance of Christianity or, to say it all, as its humanization.</description><creator>Boucher, François-Emmanuël.</creator><contributor>Angenot, Marc (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>France -- Social life and customs -- 18th century</subject><subject>France -- Religion -- 19th century</subject><subject>France -- Social life and customs -- 19th century</subject><subject>France -- Religion -- 18th century</subject><subject>Church and state -- France</subject><title>L'Héritage du christianisme en France 1750-1848</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bg257g68z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2n49t3632</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6h440v214</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:38:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis analyzes the problems and contradictions inherent in modernity's levelling of the fabricative and political realms. Seeking a broader perspective on the origins of aesthetic culture and aestheticized politics, it examines the relation of architecture to technology, culture, and politics. The thesis examines the consequences of the Enlightenment and "Radical Enlightenment" (understanding the rise of the modern nation-state as a direct consequence of the 18th century's yoking of history and nature) from the perspective of Japan and its encounter with modernity. Japan as a modern nation-state, neither part of the European Enlightenment nor colonized by its instruments, was able to initiate a unique discourse around the question of history and the concomitant issues of identity and nihilism. The thesis tracks the discourse through architecture as the terms shift and become more and more indistinguishable from the Western manifestations from which the Japanese architects wished to claim distinction. The discussion on difference and possibility---cultural identity and the creative project---as fundamental questions for a contemporary practice of architecture is undertaken through an analysis of the polar positions of Tange Kenzo and Shirai Sei'ichi.</description><creator>Berns, Torben</creator><contributor>Gomez, A.

IKr is the primary target of Class III antiarrhythmic agents, inhibition of which prolongs cardiac action potential and reduces the probability of reentrant arrhythmia induction. However, Class III antiarrhythmic agents can also excessively prolong the QT interval and precipitate a potentially lethal arrhythmia called torsade de pointes (TdP). Furthermore, mutations at the gene coding for IKr can cause congenital long QT syndrome and TdP. Heterologous expression of the human ether-a-go-go -related gene (HERG) elicits currents that closely resemble native IKr. The work presented in this thesis explores in detail heterologously expressed HERG channels, in particular their biophysical and pharmacological properties. We first probed HERG channels with the divalent cation Ba 2+ and the potent Class III antiarrhythmic agent dofetilide to examine the voltage-dependent pore accessibility. Our experimental and mathematical modeling data indicate that Ba2+ blocked wild-type HERG channels in their closed and open states but channel inactivation relieved Ba 2+ block. In contrast to previous reports indicating that dofetilide only blocked the open state of HERG channels, our data clearly show that dofetilide interacted with both the open and inactivated states. We then examined the need for association between the recently cloned MiRP1 (minK-related peptide 1) subunit in imparting properties similar to that of native IKr to HERG. We demonstrated that the pharmacological characteristics of HERG channels expressed in CHO cells is very similar to IKr recorded from guinea pig myocytes. The minor discrepancies between the cloned and native currents (i.e. deactivation kinetics and voltage dependence of activation) were not rectified by MiRP1 co-expression. Thu In summary, our findings demonstrate that HERG channels are accessible in a state-dependent manner from the extracellular side by Ba2+ ions and the intracellular side by dofetilide. The characteristics of HERG channels that govern its sensitivity to drug blockers do not appear to require an association with its putative MiRP1 beta-subunit. The latter finding has important implications for screening of novel drugs for an early determination of their potential to prolong the QT interval, in particular those agents that are not meant to possess IKr inhibitory properties. Inhibition of HERG channels expressed in a mammalian cell line will provide a very close approximation of the sensitivity of native IKr to these agents.</description><creator>Weerapura, Manjula.</creator><contributor>Nattel, Stanley (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</subject><title>Biophysical and pharmacological properties of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier current</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bn9998329.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8623j049h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:79407z82r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:38:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study investigates the expression and repression of desire in four 20th-century German-language lesbian prose texts. I examine in chronological order three novels and one novella: Der Skorpion (1919) by Anna Elisabet Weirauch; Lyrische Novelle (1933) by the Swiss author Annemarie Schwarzenbach; Der Schlachter empfiehlt noch immer Herz (1976) by Margot Schroeder; and, finally, Bilder von ihr (1996) by Karen-Susan Fessel. While not concentrating on any single literary work, the excursus on texts from the period between the Third Reich and the Second Feminist Movement in Germany provides a brief analysis of the (lack of) lesbian literary developments during this time. Drawing on diverse lesbian-feminist and queer strains of criticism, this study provides a close examination of the narrative elements, strategies, and styles used to inscribe lesbian desire into the literary works selected for analysis. The investigation explores how these texts utilize narrative conceptualizations of lesbian desire, critiques of heterophallocentric language and representation, and strategies to create lesbian narrative spaces that challenge the heterosexual presumptions and trajectories which traditionally underlie conventional Western romance narratives. The constructions of "lesbian" identity presented in the texts are fundamentally connected to the creation and operation of these narrative spaces. Thus, in order to contextualize my interpretations and literary analyses, I situate the texts in the respective socio-historical and political contexts in which they were written and received. The unresolved problems, prevailing tensions, and their individual differences notwithstanding, the narratives examined here collectively contribute to a lesbian counterdiscourse to the 20th-century German literary establishment. By exploring the strategies invoked in these texts to represent a desiring textual lesbian subjectivity, this study hopes to make visible a tradition of Germanlanguage lesbian literature---a fragmented and often marginalized literature---over the last century and to offer German literary studies insights from the periphery of the dominant heterosexual culture. However, this investigation simultaneously and paradoxically also contests the very positioning of German lesbian literature and criticism at the margins by proposing their strategic integration into the German literary canon.</description><creator>Winkelmann, Cathrin.</creator><contributor>Bauer, Karin (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Lesbians in literature.</subject><subject>German literature -- 20th century -- History and criticism.</subject><title>The limits of representation? : the expression and repression of desire in 20th-century German lesbian narratives</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pk02cc50h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/79407z82r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of German Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sn00b042b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:38:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study describes the resource management practices of a rural community located in Morobe Province, Papua New Guinea. Lababia, a community of 500 people, is located in a coastal rainforest environment and is dependant for its livelihood on swidden agriculture and fishing. Lababia is also the site of an integrated conservation and development project facilitated by a non-governmental organisation based in a nearby urban centre. The key resources on which Lababia depends are managed as the common property of either the village-as-a-whole or the various kin groups resident in the village, and for that reason common property theory has been used to inform the design of the research project and the analysis and interpretation of research results. However, the social foundations of resource management systems and the influence of external factors, commodity markets in particular, are not adequately represented in some of the more widely used analytical frameworks developed by common property theorists. These factors are of fundamental importance to the Lababia commons because of the many social, political and economic changes that have occurred there over the last century. For that reason the Lababia commons is referred to as a commons-in-transition . Ethnographic and historical analysis, informed by common property theory, is used to develop a description of the property rights system existing at Lababia and resource management practices in the key sectors of fishing and agriculture. The management of forest resources is described on the basis of a comparison with Kui, a nearby village that, unlike Lababia, has allowed industrial logging activities on their lands. The impact of the conservation and development project on village life is also assessed and the study concludes by developing an analytical framework suitable to the Lababia commons and one that facilitates the development of policy appropriate to the planning of sustainable development projects generally and conservation and development projects in particular.</description><creator>Wagner, John Richard, 1949-</creator><contributor>Galaty, John G.

The author has identified correspondences between the writings of Schoenberg, the early Wittgenstein (the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, in particular), and the Vienna Circle of philosophers, on a wide range of topics and themes. Issues discussed include the nature and limits of language, musical universals, theoretical conventionalism, word-to-world correspondence in language, the need for a fact- and comparison-based approach to art criticism, and the nature of music-theoretical formalism and mathematical modeling. Schoenberg and Wittgenstein are shown to have shared a vision that is remarkable for its uniformity and balance, one that points toward the reconciliation of the positivist-relativist dualism that has dominated recent discourse in music theory. Contrary to earlier accounts of Schoenberg's harmonic and aesthetic relativism, this study identifies a solid epistemological core underlying his thought, a view that was very much in step with Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle, and thereby with the most vigorous and forward-looking stream in early twentieth century intellectual history.</description><creator>Wright, James K.</creator><contributor>Caplin, William (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Wittgenstein, Ludwig, 1889-1951.</subject><subject>Music -- Philosophy and aesthetics.</subject><subject>Schoenberg, Arnold, 1874-1951 -- Harmony.</subject><subject>Logical positivism.</subject><subject>Schoenberg, Arnold, 1874-1951 -- Aesthetics.</subject><subject>Vienna circle.</subject><title>Schoenberg, Wittgenstein, and the Vienna circle : epistemological meta-themes in harmonic theory, aesthetics, and logical positivism</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jm214q714.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zp38wf42f</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8p58pf57j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:38:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Owing to the conflicting results obtained from the application of different analytical and sample preparation techniques, and to the complex nature of interstratified 2:1 clay minerals, the compositional and structural changes that occur with increasing diagenetic grade in illite-smectite (IS) mixed layers had not been adequately deciphered previously. Some of the uncertainties result from different modes of sample preparation, namely ion-beam milled original rock samples and dispersed separates. I have used a combined approach of n-alkylammonium cation exchange of 2:1 clay minerals, XRD, HRTEM, CTEM of Pt-C replicas of adsorbed and freeze-fractured specimens after cryofixation, and K-Ar dating is used to investigate nucleation and growth characteristics of 2:1 clay minerals from argillaceous rocks of the Reindeer D-27 well, Mackenzie Delta-Beaufort Sea (MDBS) region, Arctic Canada. In addition, three reference 2:1 clay minerals (Zempleni illite, rectorite, and Mancos Shale) were studied. Alkylamrnonium cation exchange of 2:1 clay minerals for investigation by XRD and TEM showed that the diagenetic evolution of smectite to illite in argillaceous rocks of the Reindeer D-27 well cannot be considered as a single, continuous and progressive reaction series as is conventionally proposed. It is rather a prograde sequence of discrete, multiple phases that coexist in overlapping depth intervals. K-Ar dating of illitic phases after treatment with octadecylammonium cations was undertaken to clarify the origin of octadecylammonium intercalated illite, account for its contribution to K-Ar ages, and assess the presence of detrital illitic phases in fine clay-size separates. Results suggested that K and Ar are removed to different degrees from both detrital and diagenetic components with treatment. By correlating the internal structure of the 2:1 clay minerals with the surface morphology, it was possible to show that the original stacking order of interstratified 2:1 clay minerals can be deciphered using dispersed separates, and that suitable techniques of sample preparation and dispersion can be employed to avoid disrupting the primary texture. In diagenetic samples from Reindeer D-27, the neoformed crystals have unique euhedral morphology, suggesting primary growth as free particles, rather than being disarticulated fragments of larger crystals, as proposed by the investigation of ion-milled specimens of original rock. Investigation of the reference samples of Zempleni illite, rectorite, and Mancos Shale showed that the original stacking order of the 2:1 clay minerals is not destroyed by sample preparation and dispersion. The results suggest that the concept of fundamental particles can be applied to illitic material formed in the early stages of diagenesis, but not necessarily to illitic material formed in other geologic environments such as hydrothermal and contact metamorphic environments. In addition, it was shown that the application of the technique of n-alkylammonium cation exchange for TEM is useful for the study of the evolution of S → I and isotopic dating of illitic clay minerals.</description><creator>Sears, S.

The corpus gathers chiefly novels and political essays, but it also includes anthropological essays, journalistic commentaries and testimonies. This is a study that relies on the theory of social discourse and on imagology. This investigation, which perceives itself as an overview of the images elaborated by the French social discourse on Latin America, examines closely the historical moments when there are determinant discursive mutations. Therefore, from 1950 to 1961, a first manner of apprehending the Latin American other is identified. This period was described as a moment of transition during which the French discourse goes from a discursive frame which emphasizes on the theme of nature to a discursive frame which privileges the power relations between social agents. From 1962 to 1974, Latin America becomes for the French writers a geographical region upon which one pours off revolutionary aspirations. The axioms of third worldism, primary discursive formation enhanced by this period, run through the whole of the texts at various degrees. Also, this thesis aims to reveal the figures and spaces which emerge from this whole of contradictory representations. From 1975 to 1985, one witnesses the decomposition of the discursive formations and representations established during the two previous decades. Indeed, several discursive formations during these ten years question not only third worldism and its revolutionary impulses, but also the function of the intellectual. On a more general basis, this study examines the history of ideas in France from 1950 to 1985. One of its implicit goals is to describe the rules which diversify, give coherence, integrate, exclude, and legitimate a "new" idea in the French social discourse.</description><creator>Segura, Mauricio.</creator><contributor>Sarfati-Arnaud, Monique (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Angenot, Marc (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>France -- Intellectual life -- 20th century.</subject><subject>Latin America -- Foreign public opinion, French.</subject><subject>Latin America -- In literature.</subject><title>Le discours francais sur l'Amerique latine revolutionnaire (1950-1985) /</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gq67js83s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jw827d33p</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2b88qd77d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:38:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Depression is a major mental health problem for women. Several lines of evidence suggest that fluctuating levels of estrogen associated with various reproductive events are related to changes in mood. It has been hypothesized that estrogen may exert its influence on mood via its effect on the serotonergic system---a system frequently implicated in the regulation of mood. The major goal of the following study was to elucidate further the role of estrogen in mood regulation. To this end, we examined the role of estrogen in the mood-lowering effect of Acute Tryptohpan Deption (ATD), a technique designed to cause a marked lowering of plasma and brain tryptophan, and therefore brain serotonin levels, so that the effects of decreased serotonin on mood can be studied directly. We hypothesized that (1) exogenous estrogen may protect against the mood-lowering effects of ATD in postmenopausal women and that (2) a history of affective disturbance, particularly reproduction-related affective disturbance, would be associated with greater vulnerability to ATD as predicted by the kindling model of depression. Fifty-eight postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to treatment with estrogen (0.625 mg Premarin) or placebo in the context of prospective, double-blind, cross-over design. During the final two week sof the 12-week treatment phase, all participants completed one ATD test session and one nutritionally balanced amino acid control session. We found that: (1) treatment with exogenous estrogen significantly improved mood and menopausal symptoms as compared to placebo treatment, (2) ATD was associated with a significant lowering of mood in both groups, (3) treatment with estrogen did not protect women from ATD effects unless they responded to 11 weeks of treatment with exogenous estrogen with enhanced mood, and (4) a history of reproduction-related affective disturbance was associated with more dysphoric mood in response to ATD.

Using an integrative qualitative methodology, I draw from Goldberger, Tarule, Belenky and Clinchy (1996), theories of feminist notions of knowledge, current epistemological discussions about difference, power, multiculturalism, and the expression or suppression of voice. From Street's (1994) ideological model of literacy and from Barton (1994), Hamilton (1998), and Maybin (2000), I more clearly conceptualize the pivotal role of literacy practices in articulating links between individual people's everyday experience and wider social institutions and structures. Marilyn-Martin Jones and Katherine Jones (2000) provide a further theoretical lens for viewing the plurality of literacies associated with the values, understandings and intentions that people have about what they and others do. The findings led me to four conclusions. First, in the private realm of her home the Hassidic woman commands and receives a great deal of authority and respect. Second, it is the Hassidic woman who is the final arbiter of her own information needs and her literacies encompass a diversity of purposes, materials and competencies. The third finding is that the Hassidic woman is able to successfully negotiate the various arenas of her life without compromising tradition and religious law. Finally, although many of these women in their roles as homemaker and wives, experience financial, emotional and physical hardships while raising large families, I have observed in them infinite amounts of patience, good will, serenity and love.</description><creator>Sepinwall, Sharyn Weinstein.</creator><contributor>Maguire, M.

This study sought to contribute to a deeper understanding of individual instructors' perceptions of context of higher education as it related to their teaching projects. This study investigated the daily pursuits and pre-occupations (teaching goals/projects) of an individual instructor, specifically, the instructional demands, departmental demands, the personal and professional pursuits of knowledge and the pursuits of pedagogical knowledge. More specifically, this study investigated perceived facilitators and barriers to the realization of individual teaching and other work projects. Nineteen full-time faculty members in the Departments of Physiotherapy, Occupational therapy, Nursing, Social Work, Educational Psychology and Education at a large research and teaching university in Montreal, Quebec participated in this study. The instructors were asked to complete an adapted version of Little's (1983) Personal Project Analysis (P.P.A.) instrument, which is designed to elicit an instructor's current pre-occupations or projects in his or her current context. The instructors were asked to rate these projects (seven teaching projects and seven other work projects) using a Likert scale (0 to 10) on twenty-one empirically supported dimensions. These dimensions included the following: enjoyment, difficulty, control, initiative, stress, time pressure, outcome, self-identity, others' view, value congruency, challenge, commitment, competence, support, self-worth, fun, others' benefit, self-benefit, supportiveness of culture (departmental level), hindrance of culture (departmental level), and overall current satisfaction. Instructors were asked to assess their perceived conflicts between two of their teaching projects and two of their other work projects in addition to completing a demographic questionnaire. The findings indicate that instructors identified five different types of daily pursuits that formed and defined their teaching context, as they perceived it. These five types of daily pursuits (projects) included: course planning and preparation projects; student investment, support and delegation of tasks to student projects; knowledge building and knowledge sharing projects; committees, faculty support and faculty teaching projects; and finally, teaching strategy projects. The instructors also identified five different types of daily pursuits that formed and defined their other work context. These included: publishing, conference presentation and research projects; grant proposals and funding projects; office organization projects; correspondence, university committees, outside mandates, departmental expectations and management of student and faculty projects; and finally, personal objectives and technical skill building projects. P.P.A. enabled the researcher to identify on an individual instructor level the instructor's perceived facilitators and barriers to the successful completion of teaching and other work projects. Furthermore, P.P.A. as a faculty development instrument or as an alternative to semi-structured interview methods is supported by the findings.</description><creator>Moxness, Katherine.</creator><contributor>Amundsen, C.
