The latter term, however, expresses sentiments of civic virtue or republicanism very much at odds with liberalism; hence the ultimate failure of liberals to consummate their own sense of what is most needful or necessary. Although liberals clearly desire the sensational execution of innocence, their inability to be "altogether evil" (Machiavelli) consigns them to the equivocating limbo of what R. W. B. Lewis called the "new stoicism." The liberal desire for renewal does find its consummation, however, in Leo Strauss's Thoughts on Machiavelli (1958), which instructs liberals in the salutary benefits of a philosophical republicanism. As embodied in Machiavelli himself, this mode of republicanism promises to emancipate liberals (if only they would listen) from the tyranny of innocence, thereby effecting the desired regenerative movement to civic responsibility.</description><creator>Heckerl, David K.</creator><contributor>Meadwell, Hudson (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Hensley, David (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>United States -- Intellectual life -- 20th century.</subject><subject>Responsibility.</subject><subject>Liberalism -- United States -- History -- 20th century.</subject><title>From Emerson's 'Great guest' to Strauss's Machiavelli : innocence, responsibility, and the renewal of American studies</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z316q323n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qn59q580c</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cn69m575r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:42:07Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In modern radiotherapy, 3D conformal dose distributions are achieved using several beam ports each having pre-calculated planar distributions of photon beam intensity. The intensity matrix for a given beam port is generated by independent motion of the leaves of a multileaf collimator (MLC). In this thesis, we have used the step-and-shoot approach to intensity-modulated beam delivery, the safest and most popular approach at the moment. The first component of this thesis was to write a leaf sequence algorithm to control the MLC fitted to our Clinac 2300 C/D linear accelerator. Our algorithm is more efficient than other published step-and-shoot type algorithms, and takes into account the MLC transmission, MLC penumbra, and change in scatter conditions with field size. Although sophisticated means to calculate and deliver these spatially-modulated beams have been developed by our group as well as by other medical physics research centres, means to verify their actual delivery are definitely the most problematic at the moment, making equipment and treatment quality assurance difficult to enforce. The second (and major) component of this thesis has been to investigate the use of a new portal imaging device for dosimetric verification purposes. We show that an electronic portal imaging device of the scanning liquid ionization chamber type yields images which, once calibrated from a previously-determined calibration curve, provide highly-precise planar maps of the incident dose rate distribution. For verification of an intensity-modulated beam delivered in the segmented approach with an MLC, a portal image is acquired for each subfield of the leaf sequence. Subsequent to their calibration, the images are multiplied by their respective associated monitor unit settings, and summed to produce a planar dose distribution at the measurement depth in phantom. The excellent agreement of our portal imager measurements with calculations of our treatment planning system and measurements with a one-dimensional beam profiler attests to the usefulness and relative simplicity of this method for the planar verification of intensity-modulated fields, which are produced in the segmented approach on a computerized linear accelerator equipped with an MLC.</description><creator>Curtin-Savard, Arthur.</creator><contributor>Podgorsak, E.

Interestingly, hypoalgesia has also been observed in normotensive organisms at risk for hypertension, suggesting that it may be related to processes involved in the development of hypertension rather than with elevations of blood pressure per se. Sensitivity to laboratory and naturalistic daily aches and pains was assessed in young normotensive women and men with or without a parental history of hypertension and varying degrees of resting blood pressure. In women, risk for hypertension, as defined by a parental history of hypertension, relatively elevated systolic blood pressure, or a combination of the two, was associated with decreased pain reports and increased pain threshold for mechanical finger pressure, but not for the cold pressor test. Offspring of hypertensives also exhibited a reduced response to the pain stimuli compared to offspring of normotensives as assessed by the objective physiological measure of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Group differences observed in the laboratory were generally maintained in reports of daily pain, with significant correlations emerging between laboratory and naturalistic pain reports. To assess the role of cardiopulmonary baroreceptor stimulation in blood pressure-related hypoalgesia, young men varying in risk for hypertension were exposed to finger pressure during a period of passive leg elevation and two control periods. Men with relatively elevated systolic blood pressure exhibited reduced pain during the period of leg elevation but not while in a supine position, nor following the valsalva manoeuver. The results of these studies support an association between risk for hypertension and pain sensitivity. This relation appears to extend to naturalistic pain encountered in daily life. Further, there is promising evidence suggesting that this relationship is influenced by cardiopulmonary baroreceptor activity.</description><creator>D'Antono, Bianca.</creator><contributor>Ditto, Blaine (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Pain -- Susceptibility.</subject><subject>Hypertension -- Risk factors.</subject><title>The relationship between risk for hypertension and the regulation of blood pressure and pain sensitivity /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kp78gj08q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r781wh71r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zg64tn650</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:42:08Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this investigation was to elucidate the role of the oligosaccharides of Class II MHC glycoproteins in allostimulation. Plasma membranes (PM) from the Daudi cell line were chemically deglycosylated using anhydrous hydrogen fluoride (HF). Subsequently, native and deglycosylated (dgl) Class II MHC molecules were affinity purified from their respective PM and inserted into the PM of peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) which were used as stimulators in the mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR). Stimulator and responder cells were from the same donor. Both forms of the antigen were found to elicit a proliferative and cytolytic (CML) response but the dgl antigen did so to a lesser extent. Thus, it seemed as though the oligosaccharide side chains of Class II MHC molecules may not be required for allostimulation. A similar reduction in the cytolytic response was obtained when effector cells generated by the native antigen were used against targets that were stripped of N-linked oligosaccharides by tunicamycin (TM) pretreatment. Twenty-four clones were raised against the native antigen. Three clones gave proliferative responses only to the native antigen while two clones responded equally to both native and dgl antigen. In CML studies the three clones lysed normal targets but failed to lyse TM-treated target cells while the two clones did not discriminate between the two targets. Accordingly, the three clones were termed anti-MHC oligosaccharide clones while the two clones were termed anti-MHC polypeptide clones. In inhibition of CML experiments using the dgl supernatant which contained Daudi PM oligosaccharide or using a anti-MHC class II monoclonal antibody; CML reactivity of the anti-MHC oligosaccharide clones was blocked by the dgl supernatant but not by the anti-MHC MoAb. On the other hand the anti-MHC polypeptide clones were only inhibited by the anti-MHC MoAb whether against intact or TM-treated targets.

Rate independent hysteresis is seen as an input-output phase lag, where the output can be saturated or not. The compensation is based on controllers derived from the Phaser, a frequency domain operator that shifts its periodic input signal by a phase angle ϕ, with unitary gain. When the phase angle varies, a variable phaser is shown to be able to handle minor hysteresis loops. The reduction of saturated or asymmetric hysteresis can be obtained using also the variable phaser. Practical implementations of these controllers are given and discussed. Two measures of performance are introduced to quantify the reduction of hysteresis and to compare the performance of different controllers. The controllers are implemented in simulations as well as in real systems to exemplify the use of these techniques, specifically in piezoceramic and shape memory alloy actuators. Given the experimental evidence that the feedback systems are stable, the stability of the feedback connection of systems represented by the Preisach model of rate independent hysteresis, and the phaser is shown theoretically.</description><creator>Cruz-Hernández, Juan Manuel.</creator><contributor>Hayward, Vincent (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Reduction of hysteresis : a phase control approach</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n296x0758.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bd40v</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1r66j285g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:42:08Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>To improve our understanding of the potential function of the human growth hormone receptor (hGHR) during fetal development, the ontogeny of hGHR mRNA expression in human tissues was examined. In addition, portions of the hGHR gene regulatory regions were cloned and characterized. Transcription of the hGHR gene was observed in multiple tissues from as early as the first trimester of human fetal life. Two isoforms of the mRNA coding region were identified, exon 3-retained or -deleted, and it was shown that expression of these two transcripts is individual-, but not tissue-, specific. In tissues from 117 individuals (4 weeks of fetal age to 64 years postnatal), predominant expression of the exon 3-deleted isoform occurred prior to 20 weeks of fetal life, suggesting that exon 3-deleted transcripts may be developmentally regulated. A six-fold increase in hepatic hGHR mRNA was observed postnatally, while the levels in kidney and intestine showed no significant developmental change and those in lung decreased six-fold postnatally. This suggested that multiple gene promoters might be directing tissue-specific developmental changes in hGHR mRNA levels. Since heterogeneity in the 5 ' untranslated regions (5'UTR) of mRNAs can result from differential gene promoter usage, the expression patterns of three of the eight known 5'UTR variants (VI to V8, numbered according to their relative abundance in liver) were then investigated. Expression of V1, V3 and V4 was compared in fetal versus postnatal tissues, including hepatoblastomas and hepatocellular carcinomas. While V3 was detected in all tissues examined, the V1 and V4 variants were only present in normal postnatal liver specimens; they were not expressed in hepatic tumours. It was hypothesized that VI and V4 are derived by alternative splicing of a common gene transcript, while V3 synthesis is regulated by a distant and more widely transcribed gene promoter. To identify DNA sequences regulating synthesis of the V1 and V4 5 'UTR variants, portions of the 5' flanking region of the hGHR gene were cloned. Four of the 5'UTR variant sequences were precisely placed in series (5' V7-V1-V4-V8 3') on a 3.8 kb XbaI-BsaAI genomic fragment. A transcriptional start site was identified upstream of the V1 sequence and found to generate, in postnatal liver, a long 5'UTR exon containing V1, V4 and V8 sequences. Evidence for a second liver-specific transcriptional start site, located upstream of V7, was also obtained. Alternative splicing of these gene products can result in several mRNA species, including the previously isolated V1, V4, V7 and V8 mRNA isoforms. Preliminary characterization of a 4.3 kb HindIII-XbaI genomic clone has revealed that the V3 as well as V2 sequences are located in series (5' V2-V3 3' ) in a distant genomic region, and computer analysis has suggested that there are transcriptional start sites upstream of both the V2 and V3 sequences. To construct a complete and continuous physical map of the hGHR gene, a Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) recombinant clone, encompassing more than 100 kb human genomic DNA and containing both V1- and V3-variant clusters, was isolated. Future characterization of the BAC clone will produce a complete map of the hGHR gene regulatory regions. In summary, developmental changes in hGHR gene expression most likely reflect the maturation of an endocrine system but may also confer fetal-specific hGHR biological activity.</description><creator>Zogopoulos, George.</creator><contributor>Hendy, Geoffrey N.

The prime objective of the research was to understand how a modern Chinese university is governed at the cultural level---what are the implicit governing assumptions of the upper level administrators? An objective of the completed study is to promote international understanding of Chinese higher education in light of China's 1985 education reform. Data was gathered during eight months of fieldwork conducted in the 1995 academic year. More than one hundred interviews were conducted. Documents in the University Archives were searched. My prior experience was drawn upon, as I had studied and worked at HUST for eleven years. After a brief description of the history and the campus of the university, the study includes selected major aspects of the administration of HUST including: student affairs, quality control in teaching, the academic echelon (a form of research team), academic personnel, social services, finance, and the Chinese Communist Party role in management. The concluding chapter presents an ideal-type framework to describe HUST's administration. It has three concepts: institutionalized elitism, the danwei system, and a collectivism vision of management. The institutionalized elitism refers to the institutions for selection, training, utilizing, and honoring the best. The danwei system is defined as a working/living community under a single authority. Organizationally, it supports the institutions of elitism. Both concepts are based upon a collectivism vision, that is, a collective should take care of the interests of both the collective and its members, and the collective interests are supreme over individual interests. These ideas strongly conform to the Grand Union (datong), a utopian ideal of Confucianism. Although many changes have occurred in HUST since 1985, the features mentioned are unlikely to disappear in the near future. Knowing these features should help people in working with people in China, and monitoring the changes should be a help in predicting the progress of China.</description><creator>Zhao, Juming.</creator><contributor>Isherwood, Geoffery B.

The turkey PRLR (tPRLR) cDNA was isolated and characterized. The open reading frame (ORF) of tPRLR predicted 831 amino acid residues composed of a signal peptide, an extracellular domain (ECD), a single transmembrane domain and an intracellular domain. The deduced amino acid sequence of the turkey prolactin receptor is 53.8%, 51.7%, 49.8%, 49.8%, 80.3% and 89.91% identical to that of the rabbit bovine, human, long form of the rat, pigeon and chicken PRLRs, respectively. The extracellular domain contains two homologous repeat units with 63% amino acid sequence identity to each other. The membrane-distal and membrane-proximal repeats were 53--60% and 62--70% identical to the ECDs of the mammalian PRLRs, respectively. A tPRLR transcript with a molecular size of 3 kilo nucleotides was identified and was detectable in 26 tissues examined. The pituitary gland, crop sac, duodenum and gizzard were found to express the highest levels of tPRLR mRNA among the 26 tissues. In most tissues examined there was no obvious relationship between blood levels of PRL, reproductive states and estimated concentrations of the receptor mRNA. However, in the hypothalamus, increasing blood levels of PRL were associated with decreasing levels of receptor transcripts (p &lt; 0.05), whereas, the opposite relationship was observed in the pituitary gland (p &lt; 0.05). The extracellular domain of tPRLR (tPRLR-ECD) was expressed as a GST fusion protein (tPRLR-ECD-GST) in E. coli. The expression of tPRLR-ECD-GST in BL21 strain yielded a protein with a molecular mass of 76 kDa. About 99% of the fusion protein was present in inclusion bodies and about 50% of the total protein in inclusion bodies was the fusion protein. The insoluble fusion protein was denatured, refolded and purified using GST affinity chromatography.

The two most tangible manifestations of this form of resistance are dealt with: actions of members of the non-Marxist parties before being co-opted into the Communist system, and the popular uprising on 17 June 1953. In both manifestations, the state's abuse of basic rights of its citizens---such as freedom of speech and personal legal security---played a dominant role in motivation to resist. This study argues that the 17 June uprising was an act of fundamental resistance which aimed to remove the existing political structures in the German Democratic Republic. By examining the Soviet Occupied Zone and German Democratic Republic from 1945 to 1955, it becomes clear that there existed in the population a basic rejection of the Communist system which was entwined with the regime's disregard for basic rights. Protestors on 17 June 1953 demonstrated for the release of political prisoners, and voiced political demands similar to those which had been raised by oppositional members of the non-Marxist parties in the German Democratic Republic prior to their being forced into line.

Items are usually placed in a designated neutral zone, which can be a section of the surgical field or a container, from where they can be retrieved. Use of the hands-free technique for passing sharp instruments during surgery has been recommended as a work practice by many professional organizations in order to reduce accidents, but its effectiveness has not been adequately studied. This study was designed to determine whether use of the hands-free technique resulted in a decrease in injuries, contaminations and glove tears. A prospective approach was used. All surgeries performed from the end of October, 1995 to mid-April 1996 at The Providence Medical Center in Seattle, Washington were eligible for inclusion in the study. In 3,765 of 5,388 (70%) eligible surgeries performed during that five and one/half month period, circulating nurses filled out forms in the operating rooms right after a surgical case, assessing the proportion of passes done where no more than one person touched a sharp instrument at the same time. In addition to use of the hands-free technique during surgery, type of surgery, length of surgery, bloodloss during surgery, noise levels, emergency status, number of personnel present and time of day, were also recorded. Results. The hands-free technique was used, as defined, in about 42% of the surgeries. In another 50% of the surgeries it was used half the time or almost never. It was not used at all in 8% of surgeries. An overall injury, contamination and glove tear rate of 3.9% was measured during the study period. Conclusion. Use of the hands-free technique at The Providence Medical Center during the study period was associated with a reduction in injuries, contaminations and glove tears, in surgeries with more than 100cc blood loss but a similar reduction was not observed when blood loss was less than 100 cc.

Two basic questions are addressed: (a) what types of SVCs are there, and how are they to be distinguished from other similar constructions? (b) what is the parameter that allows a language like Edo to have SVCs, and not English or French? It is argued that true SVCs are those in which the verbs share internal as well as external arguments. Based on a battery of syntactic tests, it is proposed that there are two kinds of SVCs with distinct syntactic structures: resultative and consequential. This is contrary to the unified approach in previous works such as Baker (1989) and Collins (1997). It is argued that resultative SVCs are constrained to two verbs, the second of which is typically unaccusative, and they assign their internal theta roles to a single object---true internal argument sharing. Consequential SVCs are less constrained, and involve sequences of transitive verbs, with internal argument sharing realized via an empty category, pro, as the object of the second verb. Both kinds of SVCs contain two functional heads: an E(vent) head that binds the events denoted by the verbs which it dominates, and a Voice head that licenses the Agent of the events expressed by those verbs. Some other constructions that have been classified as SVCs turn out to involve two separate clauses, each with their own E(vent) and Voice heads: covert coordinations, modal-aspectual verb constructions, and instrumental constructions. A syntactic structure for each of these non-SVCs is proposed. Based on Pollock's (1989) approach to verb raising and the checking theory of Chomsky (1993, 1995), it is argued that SVCs can occur in languages where Tense (or other Infl categories) does not need to be checked. The parameter is as follows: non-SVC languages are those in which Infl must check features with the verb {English, French, Igbo, Chinese etc.}, versus SVC languages where it doesn't {Edo, Yoruba, Ewe, Akan etc.}</description><creator>Stewart, Osamuyimen Thompson.</creator><contributor>Baker, Mark (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Grammar, Comparative and general -- Verb phrase.</subject><subject>Edo language -- Verb phrase.</subject><title>The serial verb construction parameter /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wh246t72x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8k71nj881</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Linguistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jm214q871</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:42:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis explores contemporary (post-1980) British constructions of Canada or "Canadianness" as these have been conceived through the reading and reception of English-Canadian literary texts in Britain. I am arguing that in recent years Canada has been construed in Britain as an ideal, and furthermore, that this idealization has taken place in response to a perceived cultural and socio-economic malaise within contemporary British society. I use a combined postcolonial and object-relations approach to discuss the psychic investment involved in this construction of Canada as a post-imperial role model. These readers engage with the Canadian object as a sort of phantasy space, projecting onto Canada a self-image which expresses the British desire for postcolonial diversity. Canada thereby enables the dodging of the quagmires of imperiled national identity (and personal subjectivity), for its diffuse and decentralized makeup is balanced by an essentialized notion of cultural and national uniqueness. Throughout I take issue with the ways Canada tends to get celebrated in these writings as a postmodern ideal of unproblematized pluralism and endless diffusion, knowable by the sheer extent to which it seems to defy collective identity. These celebrations of Canada as a new (postmodern) Eden succeed only in emptying the Canadian domain of anything remotely contestatory or political. Indeed, this vision of Canada utilizes a limited version of postmodernism as an idealistic play of pluralities without any sense of accompanying political strife or contradiction.</description><creator>Sugars, Cynthia Conchita, 1963-</creator><contributor>Finlay-de Monchy, Marike (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>English literature -- 20th century -- History and criticism.</subject><subject>Canadian literature -- 20th century -- History and criticism.</subject><subject>Canada -- In literature.</subject><subject>Canada -- Foreign public opinion, British.</subject><title>The uncompromised New World : Canadian literature and the British imaginary</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/73666627k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jm214q871</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3j333406x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:42:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The processing of self-relevant personality trait information was examined using the five factor model of personality. The major question addressed was whether these five personality dimensions impact on the manner in which individuals process information about themselves, relevant to these personalty dimensions, across a range of cognitive processes. Accessibility of self-knowledge, attention and memory were assessed in relation to each of the five factors. Given the strong relation between personality and affect, the role of affect in processing personality information was also examined. Overall, the results indicate that personality and mood states both influence the processing of self-relevent personality trait terms. On a self-endorsement task, Neuroticism, Extraversion and Conscientiousness were associated with shorter response latencies, indicating that individuals can access rapidly information about themselves in relation to these personality dimensions. The results of memory tasks indicate that negative mood exerted a largely disruptive influence on memory performance. On an analog Stroop task, individuals in negative mood states were found to orient to negatively-valenced trait information. An interaction was found between negative mood states and Neuroticism: individuals high in Neuroticism who were also in a negative mood state were more likely to orient to negative trait information. These findings indicate that both personality and mood factors are important variables which operate on different cognitive processes. The results are interpreted in terms of model of representation of the self.</description><creator>Sullivan, Maureen, 1955-</creator><contributor>Moskowitz, D. S.

In order to prevent the last stages of chronic venous insufficiency of the lower limbs, a case-control study was performed to identify and quantify demographic and clinical risk factors for venous ulcer disease. A particular attention was given to history of superficial as well as deep vein thrombosis. Patients and method. Patients presenting to a participating vascular surgery department between January and December 1997 with a first open venous ulcer served as cases. Controls were sampled among patients with sub-acute conditions such as back pain, cold, headache/migraine, sore throat and mild ear infections and were matched on referral, age (+/-5 years), and gender. Subjects were eligible if they were 18 years or older and had a good understanding of English or French. They were excluded if they had non-palpable pedal pulse or any chronic active diseases such as cancer or AIDS. Cases' status were ascertained by participating vascular surgeons using a standardized and objective protocol. Data on risk factors were collected with a valid and reliable interviewer-administered questionnaire developed and tested for face validity and reliability before the beginning of the study. The questionnaire has 54 items and explores areas such as obesity, disease antecedents, services utilization, lifestyles, work history, as well as pregnancy and menopause status in women. Inter-rater reliability was high and above 75% for all 54 items. Leg circumferences were measured with a Leg-O-Meter and patients were asked to fill a quality of life questionnaire. Results. The mean age of participants was 61 years for cases (n = 102) and 59 years for controls (n = 200). History of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (OR = 17.6 [2.9, 106.8]95%), strenuous exercise (OR = 8.9 [1.1, 72.0]95%) and family history of venous insufficiency on the mother's side (OR = 6.8 [1.9, 24.3]95%) were found to be significant predictors of venous ulcers in matched multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for body mass index (kg/height (m2)), history of pulmonary embolism, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, fracture, smoking history, work, number of physician visits in past year, and education. Clinical implications. Venous ulcers are a major public health problem mostly because of the cost associated with treating them. Our study suggests that prevention and adequate treatment of DVT, and monitoring of family history and physical activity will lead to ulcer prevention. This is especially important since there are no effective treatments to prevent ulcer recurrence at the present time.</description><creator>Bérard, Anick.</creator><contributor>Abenhaim, L.

Alternatively, this contentious debate has directly led to the hypothesis which posits that a combined pharmacological action on both these systems might result in an enhanced antidepressant efficacy. The development of the dual 5-HT/NE reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine has allowed to put to the test this hypothesis. Hence, clinical insight into this problem was provided by studies that documented a greater efficacy of venlafaxine in major depression when used at high doses. The present research endeavour, undertaken in parallel at the Neurobiological Psychiatry Unit with clinical studies, sought to determine the effects of acute and prolonged treatments with venlafaxine on the rat 5-HT and NE systems such as to suggest a biological substratum for its clinical features. Using in vivo electrophysiological paradigms in the rat dorsal hippocampus, dorsal raphe and locus coeruleus, we have shown that: (1) venlafaxine blocks the reuptake of 5-HT more potently than that of NE; (2) venlafaxine and the SSRI paroxetine are equipotent in blocking the reuptake of 5-HT; (3) the NE reuptake inhibitor desipramine is more potent than venlafaxine in blocking the reuptake of NE. We have documented an important discrepancy between the affinity of venlafaxine for both the 5-HT and NE transporters binding sites and its in vivo reuptake inhibition potencies: the in vivo 5-HT and NE reuptake inhibition potencies of venlafaxine are much greater than could have been predicted from its affinities for the 5-HT and NE transporters. The disclosure of this peculiarity sheds doubt on the exact nature of the mechanism by which venlafaxine blocks both reuptake processes and, ultimately, exerts its antidepressant effect.

These hybrids have more leaf area above the ear, more rapid leaf area development, shorter stature, earlier maturity, and better responses to high plant populations and narrow spacings than conventional hybrids. Plants grown in a reduced light environment are limited in carbon assimilation and this, in turn, results in reductions in growth and development. A way to supplement the availability of photosynthate is injection of sucrose into plant stems. The objective of this thesis was to determine the ability of LRS corn plants to compete with weeds, and the reactions of weed species to the shade, including the relationships between weed growth (increase in biomass) and development (shape) under shaded conditions. Three years of field experiments (LRS and more conventional corn hybrids with both transplanted and naturally growing weeds) and two years of greenhouse work [weeds alone, C3 (lamb's quarters and velvetleaf) and C4 (redroot pigweed) in full sun or deep (75%) shade injected with 15% sucrose or not] were conducted. Yield reductions due to weed pressure were lower for LRS than other hybrids. Biomass production by both transplanted and naturally occurring weeds was up to 85% less under corn canopies than when grown without competition from corn. The biomass of C4 weeds was more reduced by competition with corn plants than that of C3 weeds. In spite of quick and early leaf development, leaves and other plant parts of LRS were not damaged excessively by mechanical (rotary hoeing) weed control. Both C3 and C4 weed plants produced more dry matter when injected with sucrose. Dry weights of sucrose injected shaded plants were not different from full sun uninjected plants. However, sucrose injection did not alter shading effects on development (distribution of biomass). Dry matter production and photosynthetic rates of C4 weeds were more reduced</description><creator>Begna, Sultan Hussein.</creator><contributor>Smith, Donald L.

The goal set by the Pan American Health Organization to eliminate measles from the Americas has not been accomplished yet. Although live-measles attenuated vaccines have dramatically reduced the incidence of measles infection, relatively little is known about the immune response generated by vaccination. The principal objective of the work described in this thesis was to perform detailed analysis of cellular and humoral responses to primary measles vaccination in children from the developed and developing worlds. Studies involving Canadian children ranging in age from 12 months to 15 years of age demonstrated that cellular "memory" for measles antigens (lymphoproliferation) was induced in only 50--60% of vaccinees but that, in some children, this cellular response was more durable than anti measles antibody production. Phenotypic studies in these children demonstrated an evolution of early CD8+ T cell activation with later CD4+ T cell activation over a 5--8 week period after vaccination. Expression of CD30, a putative Th2 marker and the costimulatory molecule CTLA-4 on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, was associated with a strong humoral response while increased production of IFN-gamma and IL-12 was associated with a strong LP response to vaccination. Similar, though less extensive, studies in Peru revealed that less than 25% of these developing world children mount detectable measles-specific LP responses after vaccination, despite having high antibody titers. Although there are many differences between the two study populations (e.g.: race, age at vaccination, vaccine strain), one especially striking difference was the relative "maturity" of T cells in Peruvian children (CD45RO expression) and the marked degree of PBMC activation at the time of vaccination in this setting.</description><creator>Bautista-López, Norma Leticia.</creator><contributor>Ward, Brian J.

For some time, these pathways were thought to mediate the behavioral reinforcing action of rewards. Data from this thesis contribute to an emerging body of evidence in stark opposition to this conventional hypothesis. In vivo voltammetry, with monamine-selective probes, was used to monitor changes in DA transmission in nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of rats receiving rewards of condensed milk. This electrochemical technique offers the high temporal resolution necessary to characterize, in detail, the fluctuations in mesocorticolimbic DA transmission which parallel food-reinforced behaviors. We report here, systematic changes in both NAcc and PFC DA transmission tied to stimuli predictive of, and behaviors elicited by, food rewards. DA transmission was monitored in NAcc of rats lever-pressing for milk meals. With training, activation of meso-NAcc DA initially tied to consumption ceased and transferred earlier in time to coincide with stimuli reliably signalling food delivery. Manipulations to reward-, operant-, and temporal-related parameters demonstrated that meso-NAcc DA neurons are activated primarily by the incentive motivational properties of situational stimuli. Next, the role of mesolimbic DA in reward expectation and prediction was investigated. Presentations of non-contingent meals at variable intervals caused heightened levels of NAcc DA which dissipated slowly over days. By day 3, a biphasic pattern emerged with increases preceding and decreases following reward presentation. This was disrupted by introducing a fixed-time schedule. Uncoupling actual and expected reward presentation revealed that NAcc DA plays an important role in the expectation of food rewards, perhaps coding for errors in reward prediction. Finally, changes in DA transmission were monitored in PFC of rats lever-pressing for milk rewards. Instrumental conditioning parameters were manipulated exactly as in the first experiment. Meso-PFC DA systems were activated most when instrumental tasks engaged working memory processes. We also found evidence, albeit correlational, linking the activation of DA transmission in PFC with a cessation in NAcc---most notably under conditions for which reward expectancy was violated. With this thesis, we implicate mesocorticolimbic DA in highlighting important stimuli and facilitating appropriate responses within the reward-related setting.</description><creator>Richardson, Nicole Renée.</creator><contributor>Gratton, Alain (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Behavior-relevant changes in mesocorticolimbic dopamine transmission elicited by food reinforcement : in vivo electrochemical studies in rat</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pz50gx82m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9880vs674</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:47429b95g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:42:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Polymer melts exhibit some degree of viscoelasticity in most industrial forming operations, and elasticity is particularly important in flows involving an abrupt contraction or expansion in the flow direction. However, the incorporation of a viscoelastic constitutive equation into computer models for polymer processing poses many problems, and for this reason inelastic models have been used almost exclusively to represent rheological behavior for flow simulation in the plastics industry. In order to explore the limits of viscoelastic flow simulations, we used two nonlinear viscoelastic models (Leonov and Phan-Thien/Tanner) to simulate axisymmetric and planar contraction flows and extrudate swell. Their predictions were compared with those obtained using a strictly viscous model (Carreau-Yasuda) and with experimental results. The models are implemented in a modified Elastic Viscous Split Stress (EVSS) mixed finite element formulation. The viscoelastic constitutive equations are calculated using the Lesaint-Raviart method, and the divergence-free Stokes problem is solved applying Uzawa's algorithm. The decoupled iterative scheme is used as a preconditioner for the Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRES) method. Numerical instability was observed starting at quite low elasticity levels. For the converging flows, the predicted flow patterns were in fair agreement with experimental results, but there was a large discrepancy in the entrance pressure drop. In the case of extrudate swell, the agreement with observation was poor, and convergence was impossible except at the lowest flow rate. After exploring the limits of simulations using viscoelastic models, we conclude that there are serious barriers to progress in the simulation of viscoelastic flows of industrial importance. The ultimate source of the problem is the melt elasticity, and traditional numerical methods and rheological models do not provide a suitable basis for simulating practical flows. A new approach is required, and we propose that a rule-based expert system be used.</description><creator>Heuzey, Marie-Claude.</creator><contributor>Fortin, Andre (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Dealy, John M.

D3112 has a double-stranded DNA genome of approximately 38kbp with a genetic organization similar to that of coliphages Mu and D108. Genetic mapping and DNA sequence analysis has identified the left-end of the phage genome as encoding the transposase enzyme ( A) and the lysogenic (c) repressor. As genetic control of the lytic-lysogenic switch in D3112 has not been elucidated, characterization of the expression and activity in this region was undertaken. The c open reading frame (ORF), located at the left-most end of the phage genome, has four possible GTG initiation codons. Site-directed mutagenesis, along with an in vivo immunity assay, were used to determine that the second GTG is used as the translation-initiation codon. Northern blotting analysis, transcriptional lacZ fusions and primer extension analyses were used to define the promoter, Pc, to bp972-940 from the left-end of the phage genome. Overexpression, purification and activity analysis of the D3112 c repressor demonstrated that it binds to a 261bp Pvull fragment localized directly upstream of the c repressor ORF. We have located a previously unidentified Ner homologue in D3112. Using cloned fragments containing the D3112 promoter Pc fused to a lacZ reporter gene, beta-galactosidase expression was blocked when the fragment was lengthened from bp1099 to bp1439. A previously unidentified ORF was located from bp1033-1384 that demonstrated significant homology to the Ner proteins of coliphages Mu and D108. The ner promoter, Pner, has been located to bp957-992 using beta-galactosidase assays and primer extension analyses, and Northern blotting demonstrated that D3112 ner is part of a 2.2kb mRNA transcript. As the ner gene begins at bp1033 and the transposase gene begins at bp2539, this transcript is not large enough to encode for the A or B genes, as is seen in the early transcripts of coliphages Mu and D108.

It generates and maintains the electrochemical Na + and K+ gradients across the plasma membrane of animal cells. These gradients are the driving force for a variety of ubiquitous and specialized cell functions, such as transport of solutes, as well as maintenance of membrane potential and cell volume. Agents that modulate the kinetic behaviour of the pump enable cells to adapt to changing needs. Distinct substrate activation profiles in various tissues presumably underlie the specialized functions of the sodium pump in these tissues. Although the tissue-specific distribution of various isoforms accounts for some of the differences in kinetic behaviour of the enzyme, other factors are also important determinants of such behaviour. This study describes the characterization of two mechanisms of sodium pump modulation. The first involves alterations in the susceptibility of the enzyme to competitive inhibition by K+ at Na+ binding sites. Studies on the alpha1 and alpha3 isoform of various tissues and cells have revealed that there exist tissue-specific components that determine the extent to which the two cations compete with each other for cytoplasmic binding sites. Specifically, pumps that are highly susceptible to K +/Na+ antagonism also bind and occlude K+ much more readily on the cytoplasmic site, and this behaviour is abrogated upon fusion of pumps into another membrane environment, that of the red blood cell. The second mechanism of regulation of pump behaviour described in this thesis involves modulation of the apparent affinity of the enzyme for ATP by the gamma subunit. This membrane protein had been previously cloned and sequenced, but very little was known about its function. This study shows that the gamma subunit is expressed uniquely in kidney tubules, and has a C-terminus-in, N-terminus-</description><creator>Therien, Alex Geoffroy.</creator><contributor>Blostein, Rhoda (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>Tissue-specific regulation of the sodium potassium adenosine triphosphatase</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cc08hh25s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nz806162n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:tt44pp74t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:42:14Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Target-dependent cell death is an important embryogenic mechanism for regulating and sculpting the developing motor system. Efficient characterization of apoptosis has been more difficult in the nervous system than in other systems due to the use of several different primary culture systems as well as with heterogeneity of neuronal cell populations. We have developed a simple in vitro model of apoptosis with the motor neuron hybrid NSC34, a cell line which expresses much of the motor neuron phenotype (Cashman et al. 1992). Serum-deprived NSC 34 cells in bulk culture undergo cell death, likely from the withdrawal of the growth factors and/or hormones present in fetal calf serum medium supplements. This cell death is accompanied by fragmentation of chromatin into nucleosome multimers, heterochromatization of the nucleus, and other ultrastructural changes reminiscent of apoptotic death. Cell death is inhibitable by addition of agents which block new gene expression ( e.g. cycloheximide) or inhibit endonuclease activity (e.g. aurintricarboxylic acid). We report similar findings with primary embryonic rat motor neurons identified by surface immunoreactivity for p75 LA NGFR, the low-affinity neurotrophin receptor (Bloch-Gallego et al. 1991; Camu and Henderson 1992; Chao and Hempstead 1995). The p75+ motor neuron population could be maintained for more than 48 hours in mixed suspension cultures supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. However, the p75+ cell population was rapidly depleted in serum-deprived cultures, a phenomenon accompanied by the appearance of oligonucleosomal ladders. Serum-deprived p75+ cells were supported by the motor neuron-relevant factors BDNF, CNTF, GDNF and IGF-1, but not the non-relevant factor NGF. Serum-deprived p75 + cells were also protected by cycloheximide, suggesting a role for apoptosis in the cell death. We have investigated the role of reactive oxygen species in acquired and genetic motor neuron diseases. Interestingly, a rapid burst of reactive oxygen species is observable within one hour of serum deprivation in both NSC34 and rat motor neuron systems. This burst precedes measurable cell death by at least one day, indicating that oxygen species generation may be an initial hallmark of target-dependent death. The amplitude and temporal nature of this burst may be altered by manipulating various cellular ROS defence mechanisms. Such manipulations also alter cell death progression, suggesting that the apoptotic cascade may be dependent upon this early ROS burst. The identity, source and activity of the relevant ROS may provide insight into the etiology and treatment of human motor neuron diseases.</description><creator>Shaw, Ivan Ting-kun, 1966-</creator><date>1998</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</subject><title>Cell death in motor neurons : two complementary models</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nk322g069.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tt44pp74t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:r781wh74k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:42:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Central administration of pmol and low nmol doses of neurotensin (NT), rapidly stimulated hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) activity, increasing adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone (B) release for several hours. This suggests potent effects of centrally administered NT and a role for this neuropeptide in HPA regulation. Of several brain areas thought to be involved in mediating NT-induced effects, one site of particular interest is the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVNh). Chronic implants of the NT antagonist, SR 48692 (powdered form), into the PVNh area decreased HPA activity under both basal and stress-induced conditions. These findings suggest an endogenous role for NT in mediating hypophysiotropic HPA signalling. Decreases in immunoreactive (ir) corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) expression was also seen following chronic SR 48692 exposure (day 7). This decrease in irCRH levels paralleled the SR 48692-induced inhibition in ACTH and B release, suggesting that CRH is involved in mediating SR 48692-induced effects on HPA activity. Chronic intracerebroventricular (icv) delivery of NT (1 pmol/h for 14 days) into the rat brain had an opposing effect than that of SR 48692. Chronic NT treated animals demonstrated increased fear/anxiety-related behavior. Decreased mean locomotor activity was observed in the chronic NT-treated (1 pmol/h for 14 days) animals upon exposure to a novel environment. Thus, a NT-CRH mechanism of action appears to be involved in mediating behavioral responses to stress. In addition to a proposed role for CRH mediating NT-induced HPA regulation, it also appears to be mediating fear/anxiety-related behavior. Finally, we examined the status of NT receptors in animals with known deficits in HPA function. Aged, 24 month old Long-Evans rats, were identified as either aged, cognitively impaired (AI) or aged, cognitively unimpaired (AU) compared to young adult control rats. The AI animal showed decreased levels of [125I]NT binding sites in areas such as CA3 (42%) and DG (55%) of the hippocampus and the PVNh (72%) compared to the young controls. The fact that this is occurring in the animal known to exhibit HPA hyperactivity lends further support for a NT role in regulating HPA function.

As such, some cells tend to exist for a shorter period of time than others. This cognate response of cells to master their own demise is known as programmed cell death or apoptosis. Changes in the rate of apoptosis within a cellular system can give rise to hyperproliferation like in cancer or to degeneration like in Alzheimer's disease. The G-protein coupled receptor agpnist somatostatin (SST) and its analogs inhibit tumor cell growth by exerting direct antiproliferative effects through five SST receptor (SSTRs) subtypes. Its actions have been reported to result in either apoptosis (AtT-20 pituitary and MCF-7 breast cancer cells) or growth arrest (GH3 pituitary cells) but the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. Given the role played by numerous tumor suppressor proteins, like wt p53, Rb and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP), in the regulation of tumor cell growth, it is possible that SST could be recruiting these proteins to effectuate growth inhibition. Thus, I set out to investigate the involvement of PTPs and the status of prominent cell cycle regulatory proteins, like wt p53, Rb, p21WAF1/Cip1, bax and bcl-2, in the signal transduction cascade of antiproliferative signals by SST using MCF-7 cells. Moreover, I investigated the regulation of wt p53, p21 WAF1/Cip1, Rb and bax in rotation to cell cycle progression leading to apoptosis or growth arrest in a subtype selective manner, in CHO-K1 cells stably expressing hSSTRs1-5. Conclusions. (i) SST-induced MCF-7 cell apoptosis is associated with induction of wt p53 and bax. (ii) Apoptosis requires intracellular acidification and activation of an acidic ondonuclease. (iii) Overexpression of the ER-targeted bcl-2 protects MCF-7 calls from SST-induced acidification and apoptosis. (iv) Apoptosis is unique to hSSTR3 and involves the induction of wt p53 and bax. (v) hSSTR1,2,4 and 5 signal a G1 growth arrest with the induction of Rb and p21 WAF1/Cip1. (</description><creator>Sharma, Kamal, 1971-</creator><contributor>Srikant, C. B.

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is one of several hematological malignancies associated with Bcr-abl expression. The pathogenesis of CML, associated with P210Bcr-abl, is bi-phasic consisting of an initial chronic phase followed by a severe terminal phase referred to as acute blast crisis. The chronic phase of the disease is characterized by granulocytic hyperplasia but in which normal hematologic maturation is still intact. Patients ultimately enter the terminal blast crisis where hematologic maturation is lost, resulting in the accumulation of immature blast cells and a severe immuno-compromised state. Progression to the blast terminal phase is associated with genomic instability demonstrated by the accumulation of genetic and cytogenetic abnormalities. Results from in vitro cell line systems expressing Bcr-abl have suggested that the loss of cell-cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis, as a result of genotoxic stress, might be responsible for this phenotype. In this study, I utilized a transgenic mouse model which expresses P190Bcr-abl to extend those observations to an in vivo model for leukemia. I observed normal cell-cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis following the induction of DNA damage. However, using the Big Blue in vivo mutagenesis mouse assay system, I evaluated genomic instability in P190Bcr-abl mice by measuring mutation frequencies in vivo. I observed an increase in mutation frequencies in spleens and kidneys from P190Bcr-abl mice. This Bcr-abl-induced mutator phenotype may explain the inherent genomic instability associated with the progression of CML and other diseases associated with the expression of activated tyrosine kinases.</description><creator>Salloukh, Hashem F.</creator><contributor>Laneuville, Peirre (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</subject><title>Genomic instability in a Bcr-abl leukemia mouse model</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ks65hd93j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8w32r728k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):33925</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
