Since air was to be the refrigerant, large volumes  were required and his cylinder volume was to be 15.63 cubic feet.

Besides being in itself of considerable interest, it possesses implications for general cellular physiology extending outside of the area in which adaptation was originally studied, that of variations in micro-organisms. Thus, advances in our understanding of genetic mechanisms have already been made through studies of enzymatic adaptation. It has been predicted that further knowledge of enzymatic adaptation will throw light on some of the mechanisms of cellular differentiation in animal tissues. Arguments have been advanced to link adaptive enzyme formation with detoxication mechanisms and antibody formation in higher animals.</description><creator>Kushner, Donn J.</creator><contributor>Quastel, J.H.

Comparisons were based on total root dry weights, root numbers and top-root ratios. O.A.C. 21 roots reached their maximum weight and variability was least when the first spike had completely emerged. Top-root ratios of O.A.C. 21 were lower and root weight relatively greater under normal winter daylengths than under 16-hour photoperiods. Correlations between maturity and root weight, and maturity and root number, of seventeen barley varieties were significant. Top-root ratios were not correlated with maturity but appeared to be associated with the relative moisture requirements of different varieties. Variation within varieties was such that only large differences between varieties were significant. Light intensity during the winter was not optimum for barley plant growth.</description><creator>Klinck, Harold Rutherford.</creator><contributor>Lods, E.A.

The ultimate criterion of fabric quality is performance under wear conditions. Thus it becomes of considerable importance to devise rapid laboratory treatments that will simulate the actual conditions of wear. The importance attached to this problem is evident from the vigorous current attempts to set up international standards; from the number of organizations, governmental and private, engaged in instrumenting and perfecting textile tests; and from the demands of consumer groups for reliable information on the cloth they buy.</description><creator>Jenkins, Marjorie McMillen.</creator><contributor>Common R.H.

Other sources have been animal experimentation, and clinical cases of tumor or abscess, and accidental injury. In all of these cases the evidence has been difficult to interpret. In some respects, certainly, the evidence provided by lobotomy may be even harder to interpret, and it is not likely that it will lead immediately to the solution of a difficult problem - the localization of function in the frontal lobes - but the operation provides new and important data to put beside what has been learned from other sources. It originated with the experimental work of Jacobsen, who demonstrated an alteration in the emotional behavior of chimpanzee following ablation of the frontal areas, and this led Egas Moniz to the hypothesis that patients with mental illness would be benefited by the division of the fibers from the thalamus to the frontal lobes.</description><creator>Hoyt, Ruth.</creator><date>1952</date><subject>Psychology.</subject><subject></subject><title>Intelligence in Schizophrenic Patients with Lobotomy.</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gq67jw140.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hh294</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:tt44pr81n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T21:16:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In previous studies on benzimidazole (1), the chemistry and pharmacology of the compound were presented.

The asbestos has been obtained either from a large mass of partly serpentinized peridotite, thought to be laccolithic in shape, or from a narrow body of serpentinized peridotite that parallels the structural trend of the area, known as the Pennington Dyke. The mines and open pit workings of the larger mass have always encountered light-coloured holocrystalline dykes which vary in composition from a diorite to a quartzitic vein, but which are always referred to by the miners and mine operators as "granite". Small deposits of chromite are found in the same mass, associated with an olivine-rich phase of the peridotite. Here again, "granite" dykes are encountered, although not as extensively as in the asbestos workings. The object of this thesis is, by the study of published reports on these acidic intrusives and with the help of some original studies, to report on their petrographic character and their distribution, and draw conclusions as to their age, origin, and economic importance.</description><creator>Gorman, W.A.</creator><contributor>Stevenson, J.S.

This disease is beginning to play a serious role in the world so that it is now the commonest cause of death in the older age group. It therefore becomes imperative to deal with the problem. Many advances have already been made in this field of experimental research. Of these the importance of the serum lipid interrelationships in the geneais of experimental atheroscleroais have been repeatedly emphasized.

Heraclitus, Plato, Leibnitz, Schopenhauer, and Eddington are only a few of the thinkers whose speculations have been intimately concerned with the problem of time. For Kant, all experience involves time as an a priori necessity. Bergson makes a distinction between the linear time of the physicist and biological time--a process of accumulation and creative change.[...]</description><creator>Falk, John L.</creator><contributor>Ferguson, G.A.
