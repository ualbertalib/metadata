Analogue computers represent a general method of using one physical system as a model for another system, more difficult to construct or measure, that obeys equations of the same form. An analogue computer is one which deals with continuously variable physical magnitude; a simple example is the use of an electrolytic trough to plot lines of current flow between immersed electrodes, which are analogous to the lines of electric intensity between similar electrodes in free space. This paper deals with the analogy between the distant field of a radiating linear antenna, and the frequency spectrum of a voltage pulse. The mathematical analogy is first developed, from which the specifications on the pulse are obtained. The major part of the paper deals with the design of electronic circuits to produce the desired pulse. Its frequency spectrum has been examined, and photographs obtained to illustrate the computer representation of the field intensity from certain types of microwave horn radiators.</description><creator>Radley, Sidney Alan.</creator><contributor>Woonton, G.

Anne de Bellevue, Quebec, during September and October, 1948, and June and July, 1949. The birds were brought immediately to the laboratory and a careful examination of each was made for external and internal parasites. Blood smears were also examined for protozoan parasites. None of the birds showed any external parasites or protozoans in the blood but, at the same time, no bird was free from parasites of the digestive system. The nematode parasites were fixed in hot 70 per cent alcohol and the trematodes in hot 10 per cent formalin. Most of the parasites were alive at the time of collection so that the preparations were uniformly good. This presented an opportunity for studying a large number of well prepared specimens of the same species.</description><creator>Rao, N. S. Krishna.</creator><contributor>Cameron, T.

The family Dasyproctidae including about twenty three (23) species of agoutis and pacas is peculiar to the neotropical region. Two species of this family are found in Trinidad viz. Dasyorocta agouti and Coelogenys paca. The agouti, (Dasyprocta agouti) is found also in a few of the islands north of Trinidad but, with the possible exception of the one found in Tobago, the others were most likely introduced by man.

This improvement has been due to many factors, the most important of all being the careful preoperative preparation of the patients. Formerly, patients were admitted to the hospital and in a day or two were operated on. The bowels were full of faeces and teeming with bacteria, and as a result the mortality after operation often ranged from sixty to seventy per cent, even in the hands of the best surgeons. In the past fifteen or twenty years, however, it became apparent that certain measures could be taken to reduce mortality. It was shown that one cause of the high morbidity and mortality was lack of pre-operative preparation. It became the practice to precede an operation by at least a weeks preparation which consisted of a preliminary purge, followed by colonic irrigations, a liquid diet and parenteral feeding. There was an immediate reduction in mortality following operations on the colon after this regime. Then with the introduction of the sulfonamides, a new era in the surgery of the colon was inaugurated. Intraperitoneal and parenteral administration of the readily absorbed sulfonamides induced a redaction in the incidence of peritonitis, but the most pronounced change followed the introduction of sulfonamides which were poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when taken orally [...]</description><creator>Riddell, Marion I.</creator><contributor>Murray, E.

The phosphate salts are responsible for the firmness and resistance which are two of the main characteristics of bone. The problem of bone formation has been approached in two ways; First, histologically by the comparison of bones from animals of various ages; Secondly, by chemical estimation of bone salts and more recently phosphatase. In spite of the large amount of knowledge accumulated on the subject, many points are still obscure. Indeed, our knowledge of bone formation has hardly improved since the end of the last century. However, the availability of P^32 has offered a new method of approach, which so far has only been used by biochemists (Hevesy in Denmark; Hodge and collaborators in Rochester.). Their work led them to the conclusion that bone contains two different types of phosphates, a labile fraction which is in continuous exchange with the phosphate of the blood and a stable fraction which remains fixed in the skeleton. The relation of these findings to the problem of ossification remains, however, quite obscure.[...]</description><creator>Robichon, Jacques.</creator><contributor>Evelyn, K.

It is not difficult to discover the meaning of this remark, and what follows is little more than an elaboration upon it. The main occupation, one might almost say obsession, of most modern philosophy is with knowledge. That hybrid epistomology, the child of logic and psychology, occupies most of the thoughts of our modern philosophers.‘What does it mean?”, “how can I know?”. These are the questions which are considered to be of fundamental importance. Surely this is a wrong evaluation. The essential and fundamental problem is with the one who knows; with man himself. “Man is the key to the mystery of knowledge and existence.” Yet we are told that questions which concern the nature and destiny of man are “meaningless”; or else the answers given are the expression of a social background, or a “complex”. The only business of a philosopher is analysis; not the analysis of man’s problems, but of man’s propositions. The philosophy which results from this attitude has three main characteristics. In the first place, it is difficult and technical and requires a certain amount of mental effort to be understood, but a mere display of cleverness does not make philosophy meaningful.[...]</description><creator>Robinson, Jonathan.</creator><contributor>Sprott, S.

Farlow (1880, 1886) was the first to study the microscopic entity associated with the reddening of salt codfish. Subsequently, bacteria were shown to be responsible for much of the biological activity observed in salt flats and lakes. Bacteria found in these environments were referred to as being “halophilic”. The term halophilic stems from two Greek words: halos and philus meaning respectively “salt” and “loving”. The extent to which bacteria may be considered as “salt loving” has been interpreted rather loosely by the several groups working with these bacteria. Rubentschik (1928), Hof (1935), and Sperlich (1912) applied the term to bacteria which found their optimum development at a certain salt concentration, regardless of their ability to grow in salt-free media; if the organism did not develop in fresh water media, it was considered an “obligate halophile”; if the bacteria developed optimally in salt-free media but could also grow in salt-containing media they were considered “halotolerant”. Horowitz-Wlassowa (1931) proposed the term “halobe” for those bacteria which grew only in nutrient media with added salts. She used the term “halophile” to designate bacteria which tolerated high concentrations of salt but which still developed [...]</description><creator>Robinson, John.</creator><contributor>Gray, P.

The development and improvement of the apparatus is described. Preliminary runs without recirculation were made in order to obtain basic curves for purposes of comparison. In the original arrangement, recirculation was obtained by means of a jet facing upstream, some results were obtained and estimations of induced reverse flow were attempted. Because of the many unknown and uncontrollable factors this method was eventually abandoned in favor of an adapter which brought the recirculating air up to the burner itself. Tests under these conditions show qualitative agreement with the theory over part of the range covered by the tests. The agreement may be expressed as follows: 1. An increase in recirculation improves stability. 2. A given increase in recirculation has a much greater effect at low absolute values of recirculation than at higher ones. The influence of factors other than recirculation, on stability, is described. Suggestions, together with a sketch of a proposed combustion tube to isolate the effect of recirculation, have been made for further work in this field.</description><creator>Rogers, James Terence.</creator><contributor>Mordell, D.

King, in an intensive series of experiments and theoretical examination, developed the hot-wire anemometer and indicated the linear relation between the heat lost by a hot wire in a moving stream of air and the square root of its velocity, at high velocities. The hot-wire microphone, a sensitive means of detection of acoustic waves was brought into prominence by Tucker and Paris. With grids of fine platinum wires mounted in the necks of suitable resonators they were able to detect, selectively, low frequency sound waves which were quite inaudible. In their method, a grid of wires raised to high temperature above ambient by the passage of d.c. current was exposed to the resonantly-amplified air-particle velocity, thereby effecting average and periodic cooling, producing average and periodic resistance changes. The former was measured with a Wheatstone net, the latter produced a periodic voltage which was amplified and measured with a tuned galvanometer. Also developed by them was an empirical relation which indicated that the heat lost by the grid varied as the square of the velocity of unidirectional air, at very low velocities.[...]</description><creator>Rosen, Charles Abraham.</creator><contributor>Howes, F.

There have been a number of reports in the literature on allegedly successful or unsuccessful attempts to stimulate the rate of peripheral nerve regeneration. As regards the use of massage in this connection, many investigators have stressed the value of its application to denervated muscles, in order to maintain them in as healthy a state as possible for their resumption of function following their reinnervation. However, little has been written of the effect of massage applied directly to the peripheral nerve at the point of its injury and repair. Indeed, a careful review of the pertinent literature has not disclosed any report of a controlled investigation, either clinical or experimental, of this particular aspect of the problem. The present investigation was undertaken at the suggestion of Dr. William V. Cone. Dr. Cone has had the impression that, in patients in whom daily massage could be applied directly over the suture site in an injured peripheral nerve (such as the median nerve at the wrist), the rate of functional recovery of this nerve has been more rapid than in patients not treated in this way. Our experiments were therefore planned to evaluate more objectively this clinical impression.</description><creator>Rosen, Harold Jacob.</creator><contributor>Cone, W.

It has interested others and similar studies have been done in the past whereby treatment of illness was evaluated in terms of the person or persons involved to effect the best solution to the patient’s manifold problem- Many physicians are remembered not only for their contribution to science but also for their wisdom and skill in healing. It was such physicians who, in the first decade of the twentieth century initiated the partnership of medicine and social work. One of these physicians, Richard C. Cabot established in the Massachusetts General Hospital one of the first social service departments. Following this, he wrote a book in which he stressed that the success of treating a patient depended on the understanding the doctor had for that sick person and his social environment.1 At nearly the same time similar departments were established in hospitals in other parts of the United States and Canada and the combined efforts of doctors and social workers developed a special area of study. Since this beginning, many books have been written in which Dr. Cabot’s theme on the social and emotional aspects of illness was expanded.[...] This study will deal with one aspect of that broad subject, the partnership of medicine and social work and how it is put into practice at R.V.H.[...]</description><creator>Samuel, M.

Usually this operation is carried out by an enterpriser whose sole business is the hauling of milk from the primary producer to the distributor. On the average, the cost of transporting milk from the farm to the distributor amounts to about three-quarters of a cent-/per quart. Whether this amount represents the cost of bringing an adequate supply of high quality milk to the market, avoiding inefficiency and/or excessive profits, is a question which concerns the consumer, farmer, trucker and distributor.[...]</description><creator>Shipley, W.

The main purpose is to reveal the most effective ways of helping children of this age with any behaviour difficulties which may arise. To accomplish this end, a study was first made of the types of problems presented by twenty-four children. These included various forms of anti social behaviour, certain manifestations of emotional disturbance, and difficulties in the areas of school work or relationships with adults and children. The factors underlying the problems were explored, and information was obtained about what could be done and what was done in the way of treatment. The writer’s interest centered largely upon those areas in which the caseworker was able to use her knowledge and casework skills to help the patient and his family- It was found that the worker’s goal in casework treatment was to a considerable extent dependent upon the findings and recommendations made by the psychiatrist. The 10-12 year age group was selected because children in this age group have not been described extensively in child guidance literature.[...]</description><creator>Simpson, Eleanor A.</creator><date>1950</date><subject>Social Work.</subject><title>Possibilities of casework with pre-puberal children.</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cf95jf35f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dn39x455b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qr46r4292</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T18:13:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Benzoyl peroxide is still widely used in polymerization reactions and in other experiments where a source of free radicals is required. Quantitative interpretation of the results of these experiments requires that the mechanism of the decomposition of benzoyl peroxide be known with some precision. A review of the literature showed two main schools of thought on the mechanism of the decomposition of benzoyl peroxide. One of these proposes dissociation of the peroxide into two benzoate radicals with subsequent reaction of the radicals. The other involves direct reaction of the peroxide without prior dissociation. The proponents of the first line of thought disagree on the behaviour of the radicals. Some favour a chain reaction while others specify that the reaction of the radicals with the solvent is the rate controlling step. The problem is being investigated in an effort to determine the mode of reaction of the peroxide and the presence or absence of a chain mechanism.</description><creator>Sims, Richard Paul Andrew.</creator><contributor>Winkler, C.

The tumours produced by this compound originate in various sites of the body. Although this offers definite advantages over drugs with strictly local carcinogenic action, the site of the tumours is frequently difficult to determine, being dependent on different factors. In the Fall of 1949, it was observed that animals receiving a higher absolute daily dose of this drug developed early liver lesions. This attracted the interest of our Director, Dr. D.R. Webster, who was impressed by the possibility of consecutive studies of liver changes by partial hepatectomies at regular intervals. Using this method, the course of changes preceding development of malignant tumours could be followed and conclusions drawn by comparison with the rest of the colony subjected to the original experimental plan. The second part of the thesis concerns the effects of adrenergic blockade on carcinogenesis. This question has not been investigated previously and consideration is given to the reasons, which the author found convincing, to use this experimental approach. Although the effects of adrenergic blocking agents are discussed in general, particular reference to the liver is made in correlation with the results obtained by partial hepatectomies.[...]</description><creator>Skoryna, Stanley C.</creator><contributor>Webster, D.

That is to say that, in trying to understand the Chemical behaviour of atoms, some knowledge of the physical structure of those atoms is required; and if the relevant information is not forthcoming from other disciplines, it must be inferred — “invented”, if you will. In similar fashion the physicist has had to “invent”, and rather freely at times. All atomic nuclei, if composed solely of the more readily observable constituents, should blow up instantly and with incredible violence. But matter is surprisingly stable. To explain this stability, physicists now think of the nuclear constituents as being involved in an esoteric process known as “meson exchange”, which serves to unite them. Needless to say, no physicist has observed this process directly. Another instance from physics concerns certain peculiarities in the emission of electrons from radioactive nuclei; peculiarities which seemingly involve a local violation of some of the most basic laws of physics. To avoid this unpleasant situation, a rather embarrassing particle called the neutrino has been invented --- embarrassing because the neutrino apparently plays no other role in the physicist’s picture of the world, nor does it seem at present even theoretically possible to detect in any direct fashion.[...]</description><creator>Smith, Alfred Arthur.</creator><contributor>Malmo, R.

It has been demonstrated (l) that a signal-to-noise improvement of 11 db may be obtained over an “on-off” system. The spurious sideband transmission is reduced, (2) and the problem of keying is greatly simplified as the carrier is, essentially, frequency modulated rather than being switched on and off. This method of transmission is at present being used extensively by military and civil communication services working between fixed points. The keying units employed are not, however, readily adapted to mobile use where flexibility and compactness are required in addition to the stability and reliability which is provided. The keyer unit in most common use (2) contains a local oscillator as part of the frequency determining circuit. This requires oven control of critical components and consequently great bulk. The mixer principle which is employed calls for crystals whose frequency differs from the transmitted frequency by 200 Kc/s, which complicates the crystal procurement problem. Various systems have been devised to give crystal control to normal F.M. transmitters. These include the Armstrong system, discriminator control systems and frequency comparison systems. These methods have not been adapted to frequency shift transmission for various reasons as will be outlined in the following pages.[...]</description><creator>Smith, David Lloyd.</creator><contributor>Howes, F.

Six of the colors in the visible helium spectrum ranging from red to violet, and seven white light transmissivities ranging from 0% to 73% are investigated. The history of such investigations is briefly reviewed and the theory examined. A description of an aluminum evaporation apparatus constructed at McGill University is given.

Howell* in the summer of 1949. Howell built the first pilot apparatus to burn vapourized hydrocarbon fuels and used it to measure the carbon deposited on the walls of the flame tube. This apparatus was rebuilt by the writer and adapted to the measurements of the total free stream carbon appearing in the exhaust. Four fuels were tested and it was found that total carbon formation is primarily a function of the conditions of combustion and, to a much smaller extent, of the properties of the fuels used. The first appearance of free stream carbon occurs almost exactly at the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio for any given fuel, and increases rapidly as the air-fuel ratio is decreased. Turbulence and the quality of mixing are major factors in determining the amount formed. A better indication of carbon-forming tendencies is obtained by studying the carbon precipitation on the fuel nozzle tip. Marked differences exist between amounts deposited by different fuels and the formation depends to a smaller extent on the conditions of combustion. The rate of formation seems to be linked closely to the temperatures existing in the combustion zone, but further work must be done before conclusive results can be obtained.</description><creator>Stachiewicz, J.
