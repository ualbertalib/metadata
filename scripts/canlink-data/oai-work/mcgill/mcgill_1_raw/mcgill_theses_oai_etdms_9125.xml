In spite of the early discovery of furans, knowledge of this particular branch of organic chemistry is still very limited. Most attempts at determination of structure by substitution and addition reactions have failed, since furan and substituted furans are highly sensitive to the action of mineral acids. In most cases,these bring about the formation of tars, resins and heavy olls of such complex structures that it has been impossible as yet, to determine their nature. The sensitivity of the furan Qampounds depends upon the nature of substituent groups, and as. one consequence, considerable work has been carried out on the more stable furoic acid.[...]</description><creator>Leger, Francis John.</creator><contributor>Hibbert, H.

In practically all cases where breeding of hymenopterous parasites has beenattempted, 'one of the chief difficulties has been that of securing a ratio of females to males comparable to that occurring in nature, where inthis order the females are usually in excess of the males. Since, in most of the parasitic Hymenoptera so far studied, males will fertilize morethan one female, the success of laboratory breeding operations is in proportion to the number of females which can be reared. The desirability ofinvestigating the factors governing the production of females at once becomes apparent. Any contribution to the knowledge of the operation of suchfactors would be of considerable value to biological control work. [...]The experiments carried out indicate that many of the environmental facto~s which it was felt were important in their relation to sex ratio inChelonus have no significance. It appears also that the reduced number of females secured in the laboratory is the result of lack of fertilization of a sufficientnumber of the eggs laid by mated females and not of any selective eliminationo The practice of rearing the parasitized host larvae at hightemperatures is shown to reduce the number of females in the offspring. In the laboratory many successive generations of this species have beenreared without any new introductions of stock. It is very probable that considerable inbreeding has occurred. This is also shown to affect the sexratio adversely. It is the writer's ,opinion that these two factors have sufficient significance to explain the low number of females obtained inthe laboratory.</description><creator>Wishart, George.</creator><contributor>Brittain, W.

It has long been realized bythese and other writers that the processes of secretion, activated by either nervous or humoral stimuli, involve a certain expenditure of energy;and in recent years various writers have concerned themselves with the study of this aspect of secretion. In this connection, they have describedin considerable detail the metabolic changes initiated in the glands by secretory stimulation. From their reported experiments the conclusion maybe drawn that the same principles whioh govern the metabolism of contracting muscle also apply to the activated digestive glands. However, therehas been little attempt on the part of these writers to analyze their findings in terms of the functional regulation of the glands in question. This wouldnecessitate the correlation of the present knowledge of factors which are primarily concerned in the regulation of the glandular cells with theknowledge of the metabolic factors which are concerned in the secretory response of the cells. Such a correlation correlation has been attemptedin the present investigation. [...]</description><creator>Hebb, Catherine.</creator><contributor>Babkin, B.

On acoount of its extreme reaotivity and the difficulty encountered in handling fluorine gas, no satisfactory method for direot fluorination has ever been developed.The usual way of preparir~ organic fluorine compounds has been to avoid direot fluorination and to use as a fluorinating agent some inorganic fluoride having readily replaoeable fluorine or by the diazo reaotion in the oase of aromatio oompounds. If there were any organic oompounds containing loosely bound fluorine it might be possible to use tilem for fluorination. For some time aryl iododichlorides have been known and prepared by a number of investigators. Keppler (1) found that when phenyliododiohloride was exposed to the action of sunlight in a sealed tube for three days there was a slow decomposition and p-ohloroiodobenzene  was isolated from the produots. Thus phenyliodod1ohloride has ohlorinated its own benzene nuoleus.  Although no instanoe has been reported in the literature it seems likely that it should much more easily give up chlorine to aliphatic unsaturated compounds. In an analogous manner to that of Keppler, Rinkes (2) showed that small amounts of 0- and p-fluoroiodobenzene oould be obtained from phenyliododifluoride by heating it on a waterbath for one-half hour and keeping three months at room temperature; somewhat larger amounts of diphenyl were isolated.[...]</description><creator>Halley, Leroy Franklin.</creator><contributor>Allen, C.

In the development of this new type of economic and social organization, people are being mobilized into vast new aggregates;in thecourse of this they are cut away from their moorings, whether these be thought ot in terms of birthplace, social position or established customsand traditions. Such an upheaval. leaves few areas of human life unchanged. The present study attempts to describe what is happening to the size ofthe family as it adjusts to these new conditions. [...]The forces acting unfavorably on the family tend likewise to reduce its size. Mobility and communication are achieved in a city, in part, bysacrificing space. Children do not harmonize with the crowded living conditions of urban life. While the conditions of urban living are inimicalto traditional family life, the attitude of rational choice allows one to seek alternatives. Emancipation of women has gone on to the place wheremany prefer a work career to married life, and the bachelor apartment allows them to live an individualized life. It is inevitable that a secularattitude in people would result in their experimenting with contraceptive methods. Where children conflict with one Ta attempts to achieve acoveted status, this phase of family life comes into the realm of rational control and technique.</description><creator>Hall, Oswald.</creator><contributor>Dawson, C.

The question as to the best method of representing this factor is still anunsettled one, although from theoretical considerations and. some evidence, it appears that saturation deficit should most nearly satisfy therequirements.The insect studied was the "confused flour beetle, Tribolium confusum Duval, chosen largely because of its suitability for experimental purposes.On account of the magnitude of the experiment, this part of the study deals only with the egg stage. A technique was devised in accordance with the requirements of the experiment. At each of four temperatures, six different saturation deficiencies were maintained. In each of the twentyfourconditions there were placed fifteen lots of ten eggs each, or 3600 egg.s studied in 360 separate lots.

I undertook this investigation of gastric secretion and motility in the lessorganized vertebrates in the belief that it would lead to an approach of a better understanding of the complicated secretory and motor processesof the stomach of the more highly organized mammals.The following vertebrate animals were employed: Elasmobranch fishes (skate), Amphibia (Necturus or mud-puppy, andfrog), and birds (pigeon and chicken). Early in the research many differences in gastric physiology between these lower vertebrates and the mammalswere found. With the view of determining whether the gastric processes of the lower forms were recapitulated in the ontogeny of the mammal, I usedthe stomach of the mammalian foetus and new-born (cat and dog). Finally, since the lower vertebrates (except birds) were cold-blooded animals, Idecided to investigate a mammal that has a low body temperature. For this purpose I chose the groundhog during hibernation.</description><creator>Friedman, Moe Hegby Fred.</creator><contributor>Babkin, B.

The reaction is retarded by the oxygen formed in it according to theequation above, due to the preferential adsorption of the oxygen. 2. Oxygen added in large quantities tends to swamp out the effect of oxygenformed in the reaction, so that the reaction becomes virtually first order. This holds unti1 the concentration of added oxygen is equal to or lessthan that of the nitrous oxide. 3. With small amounts of added oxygen the reaction rate :follows the retarded reaction equation except that theslope is different when plotted, varying with the concentration of the added ·oxygen. 4. Added oxygen is no:,t as efficient in retarding the reactionas that formed in the reaction. This is probably due to a slight time lag before desorption.</description><creator>Folkins, Hillis Otty.</creator><contributor>Steacie, E.

He is read only by those ·who wish to study him. as a literary figure, by thosewho wish to study his Tory democracy as propounded in the novel form, and lastly by those few who enjoy the novels for the intrinsic merits theypossess. Despite their brilliance, the novels are essentially political or social, and the average reader of today refuses to accept politicaldissertations and detailed information of the Parliamentary history of the mid-nineteenth century as essential elements of fiction. Disraeli,amid the spectacle of mid nineteenth century naturalism, is an imperfect realist. He is often mystical, end more often idealistic, and thesequalities are not particularly admired in fiction to-day, especially when presented in so elaborate and grandiloquent a style as Disraeli's.However, despite the fact that his works are seldom to be found on the shelves of private libraries to-day, Disraeli's works established acompletely new genre in English fiction, and they hold an unique place in the history of English literature. Disraeli was not the originator ofpolitical fiction, but that he made an important contribution to this new literary genre, and that he established the political novel with apurpose in English literature, there can be no doubt. If he was not an inspired guide to the human race,he was, at least, one of its greatest showmen. [...]</description><creator>Falle, George, Gray.</creator><contributor>Files, H.
