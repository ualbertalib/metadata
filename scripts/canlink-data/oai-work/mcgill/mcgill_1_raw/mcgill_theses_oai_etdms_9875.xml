No adequate explanation of all the phenomena has yet appeared. Some investigators cling to the classical picture of this transition. They believe that a liquid differs from a gas by degree only, and hold that when the critical change occurs the two phases are physically identical. Anomalous behaviour, which has been observed, would be attributed to impurities, gravitational effects, and other extraneous factors. On the other hand, an increasing amount of evidence has been, and is being presented, in favour of a structural concept of the liquid state. Many suggestions as to the nature of the liquid have been presented but most agree that it differs from the gaseous state in kind as well as degree. Studies of the critical temperature-critical pressure region, where the two phases interchange, have been most fruitful in obtaining data on the nature of the differences between them. [...] Dynamic structure hypotheses have been satisfactory in explaining many of the critical phenomena. Among the most satisfactory of these is the theory of Regional Orientation developed by Maass and his co-workers. [...] The experiments described in this thesis give further support to this picture of the liquid state and have led the author to suggest a mechanism for the phase transformations in the critical region.

[...] The plant is believed to absorb its phosphorus as inorganic phosphate, and hence a study of the soluble inorganic fraction would seem to be of great practical importance. According to this view the decomposable organic fraction must be mineralized in the soil to inorganic form in order to be used by the plant. Therefore the uptake of phosphorus by plants is likely to be regulated by the nature of the soil inorganic phosphorus complex. [...] Since soils are the product of the weathering of rock materials, and, under similar conditions of climate, develop similar chemical and physical characteristics, it is easily conceivable that the phosphorus compounds of individual soils may be characteristic of the weathering to which they have been subjected. [...] Could we not, then, construct acid solubility curves for soil phosphate which would be characteristic of soils of the same type? If such curves can be constructed, then from a knowledge of the chemical and physical composition of the soil, its previous history and the shape of the curves, it should be possible to deduce further information regarding the manner in which phosphorus is combined with the soil constituents.

This is accomplished by the solvent action of an alkaline cyanide solution on the precious metal. This process is complex and if the mechanism of the solution of gold is clearly understood today it is within very recent years that this understanding has been achieved. The variables in the cyanide process have been the subject of much research but there is one which has received less than its due share of attention: the oxygen content of the solution. Holmes (1) states that "it has been established beyond possibility of doubt that the presence of oxygen is necessary for the solution of gold in aqueous potassium cyanide." Little work, however, has been done on the effects of increased oxygen concentration on the rate of dissolution of gold. The investigators undertook to determine some of these effects in the hope of modifying the standard cyanide process to obtain more rapid and more economical extraction of gold from its ores.

The importance of lignin and the role which it plays in plant life is not yet clearly understood. But its significance from the industrial and economic aspect can hardly be overestimated. For in the processes developed for the isolation of cellulose from various woods and grasses, there are obtained simultaneously large quantities of lignin. This lignin waste amounts to approximately one ton out of every four tons of wood used in the manufacture of sulfite pulp. Large scale industrial use of this lignin has so far met with only slight success. It is hoped that when the chemical structure of lignin is elucidated, it will be possible to prevent this vast economic waste.

In other words, by using a representative medieval drama as an example, I have tried to prove that audiences through the ages have not changed fundamentally, and that our early English theatre, though often neglected, produced plays worthy to be remembered.

It is characterized by a bisexual parasitic phase alternating with a larval stage outside of the host. The external phase of the life cycle has the larval progeny developing directly into forms infective for a new host. In addition to this, Strongyloides may have a true free-living generation composed of adult rhabditiform males and females, which reproduce sexually and give rise to filariform larvae which are also infective for a new host. Another distinguishing peculiarity of Strongyloides species is the fact that the parasitic stage in the intestine is represented only by female worms thought to be syngonic or parthenogenic. The female lays thin shelled, embryonated eggs which pass out with the faeces and under suitable moisture and temperature conditions, either by direct or indirect development, develop into minute infective larva.

The various factors of the coagulation process are discussed in detail. A section has been devoted to a review of anticoagulants, and haemorrhagic diathesis from various causes is discussed in the light of recent findings. In the preservation of blood, fibrin makes its appearance in the samples despite the presence of an anticoagulant. The experimental work, has been conducted on samples from the Blood Bank of the Biochemistry Department. It has been of an exploratory nature to determine the cause of fibrin precipitation and to find a means of completely preventing or at least delaying its appearance. The results of these investigations as well as the probable causes of fibrin precipitation are discussed.</description><creator>Roche, Mary N., author.</creator><contributor>Denstedt, O.

The duralumin rotor carries up to 96 cc of material for centrifugation. It is driven by a two phase induction motor supplied by a 1 kw audiofrequency generator, also described. The rotor is suspended from the armature, in vacuo, by a flexible stainless steel shaft. The whole rotating system is supported by an electromagnet. With this drive the rotor has been accelerated to 30,000 RPM in 13 minutes, with 1 kw power input. With 400 watts input and no attention from the operator, the speed remained within 3.1% of this figure for nine hours. By reversing the current, the system was brought to rest in &amp; minutes, with only 300 watts applied. The centrifuge has been used for a preliminary study of the molecular weight of lignin dissolved in ethanol. The effects of high centrifugal fields on living cells are also described.</description><creator>Rotenberg, Avrahm Benjamin.</creator><contributor>Foster, J.

Virtually no work has appeared on the mechanism of direct nitration of alkanes, and even though a great number of papers which deal with the nitration of aromatic compounds and alkenes have been published, the nature of these reactions is still obscure. The following review will be confined to the nitration of paraffin hydrocarbons, and will refer to other reactions only when it is necessary to elucidate. Saturated paraffin hydrocarbons have come to be regarded as extremely stable compounds which are not easily attacked by chemical reagents, and although in some measure this is true, it is probable that the emphasis is unjustified. The fundamental difference between saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons is that the former yield only substitution products whereas the latter may give both addition and substitution products [...]</description><creator>Schiessler, Robert Walter.</creator><contributor>Ross, J.

The last general study of Canadian taxation is Dr. Vineberg's monograph on provincial and local taxation, dated 1912. A fairly exhaustive search of the Canadian economics literature has revealed isolated articles on special phases of taxation by such scholars as my former teacher, Dr. W. c. Kierstead, Professors H. R. Kemp and D. C. MacGregor. Various Royal Commissions have prepared reports on the tax problem, some of which are superficial, others excellent as far as they go. The legal aspect of property and income taxes and succession duties has been com)letely covered by lawyers Manning, Plaxton and Quigg. The Canadian Manufacturers' Association has prepared a competent legal description of the federal sales tax. But nowhere was there a study which brought together a picture of the federal, provincial and municipal tax systems. [...]</description><creator>Petrie, Richards J.</creator><contributor>Hemmeon, J.

M. S. "Beagle", the flora of oceanic islands has stimulated a curiosity among biogeographers out of all proportion to their size. Because true oceanic islands in effect represent field laboratories, in which changing ecological conditions may be observed within strict limitations of area, and frequently of time, if the dates of alien introductions are known, much of the interest has focussed upon ecological conflicts between those species which are endemic to the island's flora, and those which have been introduced either accidentally, or purposefully by man. In particular, man's role as an important agent of change in the ecological balance of many islands is well documented; man disturbs the vegetation through removing species by felling or burning, developing his agriculture, and introducing alien species of plants or of animals, which may act as an additional stimulus to change. Under such conditions, aggressive species of plants may come to dominate a landscape, although the extent to which this dominance is permanent is by no means certain.

Comme la musique m'intéresse tout particulièrement, je me suis sentie tentée de faire des recherches sur ce sujet. En voici le résultat partiel; le nombre est fort grand des livrets d'opéra, fameux ou peu connus, dont le sujet est emprunté à la littérature française. J'ai dû alors me limiter au dix-neuvième siècle, la période la plus féconde pour l'opéra. A cause de la Guerre, j'ai dû faire toutes mes recherches aux Etats-Unis et au Canada. Je n'ai donc pas pu obtenir quelques articles parus dans des revues françaises et qui me semblant être assez importantes pour ma thèse. Toutefois, la biblopgraphie des livres sur l'opéra est si abondante, que j'ai dû y faire choix des ouvrages qui paraissaient les mieux adaptés à mon sujet. J'ai cru bon d'inclure dans ce travail une courte esquisse de l'histoire de l'opéra et surtout du livret, au dix-septième et au dix-huitième siècles. Pour le dix-neuvième, j'ai fait une étude chronologique des livrets tirés de la littérature française [...] Parceque la liste des livrets d'origine française est longue et que plusiers librettistes Italiens se sont servis d'oeuvres littéraires françaises, j'ai conclu à la grande importance des livrets français.

[...] Wretchedness and misery was the lot of the labouring classes in the crowded industrial centres. Fluctuating prices and inadequate wages marked the period. The labour of women and children was on the increase. [...] So striking was the contrast that protest was inevitable. [...] In the social and political field John Ruskin was both a protest and a portent. Reacting vigorously against the individualist conceptions of man and society, he poured torrents of scorn - even of abuse on the ideas (as he imperfectly understood them) of Bentham, Ricardo, Herbert Spencer and J.S. Mill, and provided a paradox that in so doing he, a child of wealth and luxury, uttered the protest of the forgotten and dispossessed workers who had been submerged in their struggle for life and livelihood. [...] It is the purpose of these pages to sketch the outline of John Ruskin's ideas and activity in the rea1m of the social and political, without examination of his ideas on art more than is necessary to this purpose, and to indicate those of his ideas which have been since his time or seem about to be accepted in our social organization.

The ancient alchemists worked in a murky atmosphere of superstition and mysticism but from this the qualitative classification slowly took shape. Through their endless trial and error experiments, the different substances and their properties became known, as well as their modes of reaction and methods for their preparation. [...] The type of investigation has changed from the study of processes with more than one reactant, to processes where the decomposition of one simple molecule is involved, from this to reactions of atoms and free radicals; all in the hope of establishing the fundamentals whereby the mechanisms of much more complex reactions may be explained. For purposes of investigation the lower hydrocarbons have been favored, since they are gaseous and relatively simple, and constitute an ideal proving ground for free radical mechanisms. They are satisfactory for the further reason that once an acceptable mechanism has been developed for a simple member, the next member of the series presents an opportunity for repeating the work with a more complex yet similar molecule, which is a step in the direction of the ultimate goal of mechanisms for complex reactions. What follows is a review of work done along these lines, and will serve to introduce the work which is the subject of this thesis, and form a basis for interpreting its results.
