Presently there is no on line method for monitoring diacetyl levels  during beer production, which can result in submitting the beer to a longer high  temperature diacetyl degradation period than necessary. This is detrimental to the  yeast and increases the time of the overall process. The ability to continuously  monitor diacetyl levels on line would provide a decided advantage in control of the  fermentation and maturation of the beer, two important factors impacting production  quality and cost. The purpose of this project is to design a biosensor that will  measure diacetyl levels on line, thereby providing a profile of diacetyl  concentrations during beer production. This will lead to increasing not only the  production rate, but the quality and consistency of the final product and can serve  as a foundation for future improvements in yeast management in  general. The initial goal of the project is to evaluate existing  biosensor technology in relation to its application in the beer fermentation  process. The second is to design a biosensor which will measure diacetyl levels and  surmount existing biosensor disadvantages based on the information collected in the  observation process. The last objective is to construct a prototype in order to test  this design. The combined results of this study will be of value to the brewing  industry specifically and help expand the role biosensors play in introducing new  more effective methods into the food processing industry.</description><creator>Vann, Lucas</creator><contributor>Sheppard, John (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Ketones.</subject><subject>Biosensors.</subject><subject>Diacetyl.</subject><subject>Brewing.</subject><subject>Beer.</subject><title>Development of a biosensor for on line measurement of diacetyl in beer</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5712m721b.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9p290b09p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:12579s83q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:15:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The signaling properties of the p75 neurotrophin receptor  (p75NTR) have been difficult to ascertain but new insights are emerging from a  detailed characterization of cytosolic p75NTR interacting proteins. TRAF (Tumor  Necrosis Factor Receptor-associated Factors) proteins are a family of cytosolic  adaptors that link members of the TNF superfamily to the JNK, NF-kB and Src  signaling cascades. We show, using a GST pull down assay, that TRAF4 binds the  p75NTR intracellular domain with high affinity in the juxtamembrane region. Of the  remaining TRAFs, only TRAF6 bound p75NTR and much less avidly than TRAF4.  Co-expression of p75NTR with TRAF4 reduced the apparent molecular weight of p75NTR  on SDS-PAGE due to an altered O-glycosylation of p75NTR. Cell surface biotinylation  and immunocytochemistry experiments established that p75NTR was retained in an  intracellular location when co-expressed with TRAF4. Further experiments showed that  p75NTR is constitutively ubiquitinated. Ubiquitination of p75NTR is not affected by  NGF treatment. Interestingly, we show that p75NTR ubiquitination is completely  blocked by TRAF4 overexpression. Other TRAF proteins play important roles linking  cell surface receptors to intracellular signaling cascades. Results obtained in this  study suggest that TRAF4 may have a distinct function involving intracellular  trafficking events.</description><creator>Vaillancourt, François, 1978-</creator><contributor>Barker, Philip A.

Tillage and residue treatments were imposed on a sandy loam to  loamy sand soil in fall 1991. Treatments consisted of no till, reduced tillage, and  conventional tillage with crop residues either removed from (-R) or retained on (+R)  experimental plots, laid out in a randomized complete block design. Soil microbial  biomass carbon (SMB-C), soil microbial nitrogen (SMB-N) and phospholipid fatty acid  (PLFA) concentrations were measured four times, at two depths (0--10 cm, 10--20 cm),  over the 2001 growing season. Sample periods were: May 7th (pre planting), June 25  th, July 16th, and September 29th (prior to corn harvest). The effect of time was of  a greater magnitude than those attributed to tillage or residue treatments. While  SMB-C showed no seasonal change (160 mug C g-1 soil); SMB-N was responsive to  mineral nitrogen fertilizer; and PLFA data showed an increase in fungi and total  PLFA throughout the season. PLFA profiles showed better distinction between sampling  period, and depth, than treatments. Of the two treatments, the effect of residue was  more pronounced than that of tillage, with increased SMB-C and SMB-N (6.1% and 96%)  in +R plots compared to -R plots. This study illustrated that measuring soil quality  based on soil microbial components must take into account seasonal changes in soil  physical, chemical conditions, and nutrient supply.</description><creator>Spedding, Timothy Andrew</creator><date>2002</date><subject>Conservation tillage -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Corn -- Soils -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Corn -- Residues -- Biodegradation -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Soil microbiology -- Québec (Province).</subject><title>Soil microbial dynamics in response to tillage and residue management in a maize cropping system</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/wp988k52z.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9306sz819</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1r66j160d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:15:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We give a detailed proof of a theorem of P.

The  activation of stress-responsive kinases (SAPKs) and the mitogen-activated kinases  (MAPKs) are known to have a key influence cell fate determination. We developed a  technique to study the regulation of these kinases by the ER in response to drugs  inducing protein misfolding. We isolated ER like compartments with a relatively high  degree of purity using magnetic beads coated with anti-calnexin antibodies and vie  reconstituted in a cell free system the ER signalling induced by different stresses.  We demonstrate here that ER-like compartments isolated from cells treated with  azetidine-2 carboxylic acid or Tunicamycin differentially activates ERK-1, JNK-1 and  p38 in vitro. Moreover, we show that the molecular adaptors Shc and Nck are involved  in the ER-mediated regulation of these kinases.</description><creator>Rousselle, Etienne</creator><contributor>Bergeron, John J.

We give a review of the scaling phenomena in general and of hexagonal  systems in particular, both from theoretical and experimental points of views. A  squared shaped grid of varied sizes, with periodical boundary conditions, was used  for the simulations. First, we studied the evolution of surfaces themselves. Then,  we considered the evolution of the structure factor's maximum amplitude, and full  width at half maximum. Scaling laws as a function of system size were found for  these variables. We also made a study of surface energies. We monitored the  evolution of the surface energies with time, and propose a scaling law for the  energies. Finally, we studied the evolution of temporal correlation functions.

Due  to its expression pattern and specificity for B lymphocytes, CC Chemokine Ligand 19  (CCL19) may help initiate the adaptive humoral immune response following antigen  exposure. Here we show CCL 19 induced [Ca2+]i mobilization, chemotaxis and rescue  from apoptosis in B lymphocytes. Because CCL19 is constitutively expressed, we  studied the expression and signalling properties of its corresponding chemokine  receptor, CC chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) in various B cell populations. We found  that CCL19 responsive CCR7 + cells belonged to distinct B lymphocyte populations at  particular stages of maturation and that BCR crosslinking alone was insufficient to  modulate CCR7 expression and CCL19 responsiveness. CCL19 induced signal transduction  events were Galphai dependent. We found that CCL19 stimulation could desensitize the  CCR7 receptor to further CCL19 stimulation, but did not interfere with other key B  cell activation signals such as BCR and PAF. Our results implicate CCL19 in B  lymphocyte activation, migration, and survival.</description><creator>Millette, Roxanne</creator><contributor>Mazer, Bruce D.

Cytokine-dependent hemopoietic cell linker (Clnk), a third member of the SLP-76  family of adaptor molecules, was previously shown to be a positive regulator of TCR  signaling. To better understand the role of Clnk in the immune cell signaling  network, we first sought to identify additional, unknown, Clnk-binding partners,  ultimately confirming the known partners, namely HPK1 and Fyb. Further studies  surrounding the Clnk-HPK1 interaction illustrated important binding regions between  the two proteins. Stable transfection studies of Clnk in the SLP-76 deficient cell  line, J14, revealed the ability of Clnk to rescue SLP-76 function, particularly in  reference to optimal tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Phospholipase  C-gammal and MAP kinase. Transient transfections of the parental Jurkat T-cell line  illustrated TCR-inducible, Clnk-dependent, gene promoter activation, including  identification of novel downstream transcriptional targets such as the pro-apoptotic  Nur77.</description><creator>Minhas, Raman</creator><contributor>Veillette, Andre (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Cytokine-dependent hemopoietic cell linker : role in immune-cell receptor signaling</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cn69m478c.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1544bp88b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nk322f00f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:15:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs), including hepsin  and corin, are a new class of cell surface catalytic enzymes. In the present study,  a non-transmembrane isoform of hepsin, named hepsin/-TM that originates from  alternative splicing, was identified. Unlike the transmembrane hepsin isoform, this  non-transmembrane isoform was distributed within the cytoplasm and likely to be  modified after translation. Real-time PCR experiments revealed that hepsin was  expressed in all tested human tissues, but hepsin/-TM only in kidney, brain and lung  tissues. Significantly, hepsin/-TM was not expressed in liver where hepsin was  originally identified. However, hepsin/-TM was highly expressed in brain where  hepsin was expressed at a significantly lower level. Moreover, these two isoforms  showed different expression patterns in several colon cancer cell lines.  Furthermore, ten corin-interacting proteins were identified and a variety of corin  mutants were generated for the studies of the relationship of corin structure and  function.</description><creator>Li, Yang, 1974-</creator><contributor>Zhao, Xin (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Serine proteinases.</subject><title>Characterization of two type II transmembrane serine proteases, hepsin and corin</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gt54kn754.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nk322f00f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Animal Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:tb09j628f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:15:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In today's financial markets, when new information is  disseminated with lightning speed across the investment community, individual  investors turn to trading systems as a way to generate profit.

Two TnI  genes, TnIfast and TnIslow, are expressed in skeletal muscle the former in fast  muscle fibers, the latter in slow fibers. The tissue- and fiber-type-specificities  of the TnI fast and slow genes are driven by transcriptional enhancer elements: a  Slow Upstream Regulatory Element (SURE) upstream of the TnIslow gene and a fast  Intronic Regulatory Element (IRE) within the first intron of the TnIfast gene.  Within the 144 bp IRE, there are 4 known cis elements, and the aim of this work was  to initiate the studies to map the element(s) that are chiefly responsible for  directing the fast-fiber-specificity of IRE-driven gene expression. This was  approached by making IRE end-deletion constructs lacking either the left-most or  right-most IRE cis-element. These IRE derivatives were coupled to a reporter gene  consisting of a minimal (enhancer-dependent) TnIfast promoter linked to E. coli  beta-galactosidase coding sequences. The transcriptional activity of these  constructs was first evaluated in cell culture transfection experiments, and then by  in vivo gene transfer into adult mouse skeletal muscles. The conclusion of these  experiments was that fast-fiber-specificity of IRE-driven gene expression resides in  the left-most 30 bp of the IRE, a region including an E-box binding site for  myogenic regulatory factors of the MyoD family.</description><creator>Kumar, Angela</creator><contributor>Hastings, Ken (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Genetic regulation.</subject><subject>Enhancer Elements (Genetics)</subject><subject>Muscle proteins.</subject><subject>Troponin I -- genetics.</subject><title>Fast skeletal muscle fiber-type-specificity of the troponin I (fast) gene IRE enhancer resides in a 30 base-pair region</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nv9353626.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4t64gn90g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:v118rf23x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:15:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The sex-determining gene on the Y chromosome, named Sry,  initiates differentiation of gonadal somatic cells into testes, which in turn  regulate the development of male phenotype. The B6.YTIR sex-reversed mouse provides a good model for  studying sex-determining mechanisms. We proposed a hypothesis that the  testis-determining pathway is impaired downstream of Sry transcription in the  B6.YTIR fetus. The current study aimed to determine the hierarchical order of  Sry, Sox9, Pn1, and Mis by examining their expression in B6.YTIR gonads as compared  to normal B6.XY gonads by RT-PCR. Results. Sry expression was comparable between B6.Y TIR and  B6.XY gonads, with its onset between 10.5 and 11.5 dpc, a peak at 11.5 dpc, and  downregulation thereafter. Sox9 expression was detectable in both B6.XX and B6.XY  gonads at 11.5 dpc at comparable levels, but was then downregulated in B6.XX gonads  at 12.5 dpc, by which stage testicular cord formation had began in B6.XY gonads. Pn1  was expressed in both B6.XX and B6.XY gonads at comparable levels at 11.5 dpc and  was upregulated in B6.XY gonads at 12.5dpc. Mis expression in B6.Y TIR gonads was  low at 10.5 and 11.5 dpc with a peak at 12.5dpc and higher levels only in ovotestes  at 14.5dpc. These results indicate that all Sox9, Pn1, and MIS genes follow  a sexually dimorphic pattern of expression associated with development of testicular  cords.

This interaction  leads to a greater stabilization of c-Jun on the AP-1 consensus site and  consequently, an increased rate of transcription. alphaNAC is a substrate of the  Integrin-Linked Kinase (ILK), which is activated through integrin-extracellular  matrix interactions and stimulates c-Jun-mediated gene  transcription. By means of protein pulldown assays, we have demonstrated that  phosphorylation of alphaNAC by ILK results in an enhanced interaction of  phospho-alphaNAC with the phosphorylated form of c-Jun. Additionally, the c-Jun  interaction domain on alphaNAC was identified. Affinity chromatography involving  alphaNAC deletion mutants revealed that the c-Jun-binding site is located in the  middle part of the protein, between amino acids 89 and 129. These results are  consistent with earlier data from our laboratory demonstrating an interaction  between alphaNAC and c-Jun as well as increased c-Jun-mediated transcription by the  coactivating function of alphaNAC.</description><creator>Hurtubise, Mélanie</creator><contributor>St-Arnaud, Rene (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Biology, Genetics.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Interaction of the alphaNAC coactivator with its c-Jun target</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9p290b10f.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k06988128</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Human Genetics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zc77sq78m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:15:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Introduction. The Carotid Endarterectomy (CEA) is used for  stroke prophylaxis in asymptomatic carotid stenosis and in patients with previous  strokes or transient ischemic attacks. Objective. To audit the operative results of the CEA in the  province of Quebec between 1996 and 1999. Methods. The Quebec Medical Discharge Summary Database provided  demographics and surgical complications following all CEAs performed between  1996--1999. Results. The CEA was performed at a rate of 42 procedures/100  000 persons aged greater than 40 however this rate appears to be declining over the  study span. Being operated on by a neurosurgeon was an independent risk factor for  peri-operative stroke (OR 1.55, 95%CI 1.12--2.12). There was no difference in  outcomes between teaching and non-teaching centres. Conclusion. The CEA is being used less frequently recently and  is being performed fewer times than in the United States. Neurosurgeons have poorer  outcomes which might be due to surgeon factors or poorly controlled  counfounders.</description><creator>Irshad, Kashif</creator><contributor>Sampalis, John (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><title>The carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in Quebec : a study of the last three years</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pk02cb470.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zc77sq78m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Surgical Research</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cf95jc00x</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:15:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Hydrolase catalyzed reactions are used for selective chemical  catalysis. With directed evolution, rational mutations and molecular modeling the  selectivity of these hydrolases can be increased and the origin of selectivity  determined. This study investigates four selective hydrolase catalyzed reactions.  Using molecular modeling the unusual regioselectivity of Pseudomonas cepacia lipase  (PCL) and the selectivity of Candida antarctica B lipase (CAL-B) in nucleoside  acylation reactions has been attributed to the binding of the nucleoside base within  the active site. The enantio-selectivity of Pseudomonas fluorescens esterase (PFE)  has been improved using a rational approach to directed evolution and models to  explain the origin of improved mutants has been produced. The enantioselectivity of  the beta-lactam ring opening reaction by CAL-B has been attributed to unfavorable  steric interaction of the substrate with Ile189 and a model has been proposed for an  alcohol bridge between the catalytic histidine (His224) and the lactam amine.  Finally, high acetyl selectivity of ThermoGen esterase E018b has been demonstrated  and reaction conditions optimized.</description><creator>Grewal, Harjap Singh</creator><contributor>Kazlauskas, Romas J.

Several outbreaks have been  associated with contaminated commercial foodstuffs such as raw milk, soft cheese,  fresh and frozen milk, poultry, seafood, fruits and vegetable products. Currently,  the official method recognized by the Government of Canada for the detection and  isolation of L. monocytogenes can take up to six days without confirmation, which  can require two more days. An approach based on molecular beacons that fluoresce  upon hybridization was developed and tested to detect L. monocytogenes and the genus  Listeria in food. Two different beacons were created: one specific to species L.  monocytogenes (MG1) and another for the genus Listeria (MG2). Each of these  molecular beacons was used with two separate sets of primers: MG1-1f/MG1-2r,  MG1-7f/MG1-4r, MG2-2f/MG2-2r and MG2-3ft/MG2-2r.

The use of SW-NIR and NIR FT-Raman spectra  coupled with conductivity and refractive index could lead to more frequent and less  costly analysis of fat, lactose and protein in milk. The present study examines the potential of both SW-NIR  absorbance spectrophotometry and NIR FT-Raman spectrophotometry to develop a model  to estimate fat, lactose, and protein in whole milk of cows. To accomplish this, 79  milk standards, spanning the range of composition seen in practice, were obtained.  Acquisition of NIR spectra over the wavelength range of 700 nm to 1018 nm was  conducted. Between 0 and 3700 cm-1, NIR FT-Raman spectrophotometric measurements of  the milk samples were made using a 1064 nm Nd: YAG laser source. Conductivity and  refractive index measurements were also obtained for the milk  standards. A partial least squares calibration with leave-N-out cross  validation was made using spectra with conductivity and refractive index to estimate  fat, lactose and protein contents. Calibrations were developed using 75% of the milk  standards. Models were further validated using an independent test set comprised of  the remaining 25% of the data that had been excluded from calibration. A second  calibration was conducted using a genetic algorithm approach. (Abstract shortened by  UMI.)</description><creator>De Silva, Kalumin Amila</creator><contributor>Burns, D. H.

This RNA molecule was transcribed in the  same orientation as the late transcripts of polyomavirus and was named ori  RNA. The ori RNA was detected by run-on transcription. In this  technique, the viral transcription complexes---the DNA molecule and the RNA  polymerases bound to it---are isolated from nuclei of virus infected cells and the  nascent transcripts are extended in vitro with radioactive nucleotides. The RNA  transcripts of a desired region of polyomavirus are isolated by hybridization with a  single stranded DNA and then RNAase treated and finally analyzed after migration on  a polyacrylamide gel. The ori RNA was shown to be transcribed by the RNA polymerase  II as its synthesis was diminished after treatment with alpha-amanitin, an inhibitor  of this class of RNA polymerase. However, the hybridization and nuclease treatment  induce some degradation of the RNA and may lead to an incorrect interpretation of  the results. Before proceeding further in the characterization of the ori RNA, it  was therefore necessary to optimize the treatment needed to isolate ori  RNA. To achieve this, we tested different conditions of nuclease  treatment of the hybrids. An RNA molecule covering the origin region was transcribed  in vitro and hybridized to three different single stranded DNAs of various lengths.  We optimized the hybridization conditions, the treatment of hybrids with nucleases,  and the conditions for elution of trimmed RNAs from the single stranded  DNA.</description><creator>Deflassieux, Julien</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Improvement of methods for detection of an RNA molecule synthesized at the polyomavirus origin of replication</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qr46r163r.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bn999730j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p5547s070</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:15:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Program tracing is a common technique employed by software and  hardware developers who are interested in characterizing the dynamic behavior of  complex software systems. However, despite the popularity of trace-driven analyses,  there are surprisingly few options for encoding trace data in a standard  format. In the past, many developers have resorted to creating their own  ad-hoc trace encoding solutions, tailored specifically to the data they are  considering. Such efforts are usually redundant, and in many cases lead to an  obscure and poorly documented trace format which ultimately limits the reuse and  sharing of potentially valuable information. The STEP system was created to address this problem by providing  a standard method for encoding general program trace data in a flexible and compact  format. The system consists of a trace data definition language along with a  compiler for the language and an encoding architecture that implements a number of  common trace compaction techniques. The system simplifies the development and  interoperability of trace clients by encapsulating the encoding process and  presenting the data as an abstract object stream. This thesis presents a detailed description of the STEP system  and evaluates its utility by applying it to a variety of trace data from Java  programs. Initial results indicate that compressed STEP encodings are often  substantially more compact than similarly compressed naive formats.</description><creator>Brown, Rhodes Hart Fraser</creator><contributor>Hendren, Laurie J.

This  defines a need for an integrating, tissue-equivalent, high resolution dosimeter. 3D  ferrous sulfate gel based dosimetry involves the use of magnetic resonance (MR)  images of radiosensitive paramagnetic gels. The goal of this work is to create a  patient specific quality assurance (QA) procedure that links measured dosimetnc  information to clinical goals. The gel dosimeter system is tested through a set of simple  experiments which characterize and confirm the system as a valid QA tool for  conformal and intensity modulated radiation therapy. For this work, dynamic photon beams are created on a  commercially available inverse treatment planning system and the treatment is  delivered to a gel filled acrylic mold. Software has been developed to quantify dose  from the QA MR images, and to register this information to the planning computed  tomography (CT) scan. The software displays the measured dose on the planning CT,  and calculates dose-volume histograms for the registered measured data and contoured  patient structures. This work reveals good agreement between planned and measured  dose distributions, with less than 5% difference in the mean doses of the contoured  patient structures.</description><creator>Brodeur, Marylène</creator><contributor>Parker, William A.

It also aimed at  evaluating changes in canopy reflectance due to water stress and LCO spray. Water  stress during reproductive development resulted in an important decrease of plant  physiological activity, vegetative growth, and productivity, and accelerated plant  senescence at both water stress levels. Water deficit increased leaf reflectance in  the visible and decreased it in the infrared ranges of the spectrum at both imposed  stress levels. Foliar application of LCO affected overall plant physiological  activity, increased flower and pod numbers. LCO treatment had the largest positive  effect on the growth pattern of soybean at the medium stress level, which is the  stress level most commonly observed in standard farm-field conditions. LCO treatment  constitutes a potential technology for reducing water deficit effects. (Abstract  shortened by UMI.)</description><creator>Atti, Sarra</creator><contributor>Bonnell, R.

Disputes between patients,  families and health care workers over life-sustaining interventions occur most often  in the ICU, and the factors that influence this dynamic, such as lack of  communication, time constraints, media-driven misconceptions and value-conflicts,  will be examined. Attempts to address futility through advance health directives and  conflict resolution policies will be critiqued.

The analysis  will focus on the situation in both the European Union and the United States, these  two countries being two of the most important trade partners in the WTO, before  suggesting various solutions that could be adopted to implement the direct effect of  the GATT in order to benefit both individuals and the WTO members. However, since WTO members are still highly opposed to the  recognition of the direct effect of the GATT, the unlikelihood of its  implementation, at least in a short term perspective, will lead to an analysis of  the situation directly at the WTO level. This will permit us to further conclude,  whether it would be possible to find solutions to palliate the problems arising out  of the denial of the direct effect of the GATT at a national level. Indeed, in the  last part of the analysis undertaken in this work, various ways to remedy the  deficit of democracy will be explored, examining alternatively the best vectors that  could be used: individuals or NGOs, in order to enhance the legitimacy of the WTO  which is principally under attack.</description><creator>Poulet, Julie</creator><contributor>de Mestral, Armand (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Foreign trade regulation -- United States</subject><subject>General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Organization)</subject><subject>Foreign trade regulation -- Europe</subject><subject>World Trade Organization</subject><title>Direct effect of the law of the GATT in the European Union, the United States and the consequences for the WTO</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v118rf25g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hq37vp21f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pn89d713n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:15:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Navigation by satellite---GNSS---is a local technology with  global repercussions. Although operation and control rest in government hands, the  consequences of satellite use, most often beneficial, have a worldwide effect.  Controversy arises when this free-of-direct-charge technology, on which the  International Community relies, fails, thus causing damage to third  parties. It was the intention of the drafters and negotiators of the  international space law regime to establish a victim-oriented liability framework,  in order to guarantee adequate compensation for damage caused by space activities.  Unfortunately, it seems that the present regime has only partially met these  goals. The surest means of obtaining compensation is through domestic  legal regimes, but these regimes are naturally subject to the ebb and flow of  government policy and judicial discretion. The present thesis will analyse the established liability  regimes for which a damaged GNSS final user may seek compensation, and will finally  consider whether the drafting of a GNSS Convention is opportune.</description><creator>Rodriguez-Contreras Pérez, Pablo</creator><contributor>Jakhu, Ram S.

In spite of constant cooperative efforts during the  investigation, the two antitrust agencies could not reach a common position. When  scholars and officials tried to find reasons for the divergence between the American  and European decisions, they often criticized the Commission's general approach of  focusing on competitors rather than on consumers. They further claimed that the  Commission had used dubious economic models to block the merger. This thesis tries to reinstate the reputation of the European  Commission as a professional antitrust institution. The criticisms often left the  impression that the Task Force of the Directorate-General for Competition of the  European Commission constituted a politically-orientated, rather than economic and  legally-orientated, organ. It will be shown that this is actually not the  case. After having analyzed the Commission's decision in detail, and  revealing both the strengths and weaknesses of its findings, the thesis will  demonstrate that most of the criticisms have to be rejected, and that the Commission  had a legal and economic basis in blocking the GE-Honeywell merger.</description><creator>Foerderer, Jens Peter</creator><contributor>Janda, Richard (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Antitrust law -- Europe</subject><subject>Consolidation and merger of corporations -- Law and legislation -- Europe</subject><subject>Antitrust law (International law)</subject><title>An unclean deal : why the European Commission was right to block GE-Honeywell</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c821gk51p.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q811kk220</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):25525</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
