Bovine trypsin as a model enzyme was immobilized onto controlled pore glass (CPG) beads to investigate the optimum conditions for immobilization, as well as the physico-chemical properties of the immobilized enzyme versus the free form of the enzyme. At pH 9, about 60% of the enzyme protein incubated with CPG was immobilized onto the CPG, and immobilized bovine trypsin activity was determined as 0.265 BAPNA U/g CPG beads. The immobilized bovine trypsin showed lower affinity for its substrate, lower susceptibility to inhibition by soybean trypsin inhibitor and higher thermal stability, while the optimum pH and optimum temperature values were shifted to higher values compared to those of the free enzyme. The immobilized enzyme was evaluated for its capacity to extract carotenoproteins from shrimp shell. After 11 re-uses, the immobilized enzyme retained about 77% of its initial activity, and the total yield of the product from the same immobilized trypsin was 4.3 times higher than a single use of the same amount of the free enzyme. Cunner fish is a cold water adapted, stomachless teleost fish. Cunner fish trypsin possesses some unique properties compared with homologous trypsins from (i) species acclimated to warm temperature regimes, and (ii) species with functionally distinct-stomachs. Cunner fish trypsin was extracted from pancreatic tissue, and immobilized onto CPG beads using glutaraldehyde as cross-linking reagent. The influence of enzyme loading, the properties of the immobilized enzyme in terms of specific activities, and responses to pH and temperature were investigated. The kinetic properties and operational stability of the immobilized cunner trypsin were studied as well. The pH optimum of the immobilized fish trypsin shifted from pH 8.5 to pH 9, and the temperature optimum also increased from 45ºC to 50ºC versus the free form of the cunner enzyme. The catalytic efficiencies (Vmax/Km) of the immobilized fish trypsin were determined for both amidase and esterase reactions, using BAPNA and TAME as substrates and were found to be greater than those of immobilized bovine trypsin. Thus, the immobilized cunner fish trypsin had a higher catalytic capacity for the hydrolysis of both the amide and ester substrates. The operational stability of immobilized fish trypsin was studied by extracting carotenoprotein from shrimp shell. The immobilized fish trypsin retained 75% of its initial hydrolytic capacity after 11 re-uses, and the yield obtained was over 20% higher than that of immobilized bovine trypsin. When the immobilized cunner fish trypsin was applied to digest native pectin methylesterase (PME), it exhibited greater capacity to inactivate the PME than immobilized bovine trypsin. The inactivation efficiency of the immobilized fish trypsin was 20% higher than that of the immobilized bovine trypsin. The inactivation of PME was influenced by PME concentration, incubation time and temperature. In general, higher temperature, longer incubation period, and lower initial PME concentration produced more PME inactivation. PME inactivated by immobilized fish trypsin and bovine trypsin regained part of its activity during storage at 4ºC. The initial PME concentration affected the reactivation period. The kinetic studies indicated that the inactivation rate constants increased and D-values (time to inactivate 90% of the enzyme) decreased with increasing temperature for both immobilized fish trypsin and bovine trypsin. The activation energy (Ea) of PME inactivation by the immobilized fish trypsin was lower than that by the immobilized bovine trypsin, which explains why the immobilized fish trypsin had higher catalytic capacity at various temperatures than immobilized bovine trypsin.</description><creator>Li, Dan, 1971-</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Cunner.</subject><subject>Trypsin.</subject><subject>Pectin.</subject><subject>Immobilized enzymes.</subject><title>Immobilization, characterization and use of fish protease</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Dan Li, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rn3015619.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8c97kv49g</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n009w647h</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:46:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The focus of this study is the dynamic behaviour of a novel aerial positioning system, which consists of a lighter-than-air aerostat attached to a series of actuated tethers in the form of a tripod. The objective of the positioning system is to achieve accurate station-keeping of a payload at heights up to 500 m. This work encompasses comprehensive dynamics modeling, experimental investigation, and advanced controller development and analysis of the tri-tethered aerostat system. The system's characteristics and positioning objectives are targeted to receiver placement during the operation of a large-scale radio telescope. The experimental test facility, built at one-third scale of the proposed radio telescope, was constructed for the dual purpose of measuring the precision of the positioning system and providing a basis for validating our computational model. The main components of the experimental apparatus are a 18-m helium aerostat, three synthetic braided tethers---hundreds of meters in length, an instrumented payload, and three computer-controlled winches. The dynamics model of the tri-tethered aerostat system is achieved by discretizing it into a series of lumped-masses, and estimating the aerodynamic properties of each of its physical elements. The disturbance input to the model is provided by a wind model that includes stochastic turbulent gusts. A series of experimental flight tests were conducted over a two-year period to study both the uncontrolled and controlled response of the system. This leads to an incremental model validation process where the passive elements of the model, such as the tethers and the aerostat are validated prior to the verification of the entire closed-loop system. The tether model shows excellent agreement with the measured response at a temporal level, while the validation of the aerostat model is conducted at a statistical level due to the uncertainty associated with recreating the actual test wind conditions. The controlled experiments were performed using basic proportional, integral, and derivative (PID) feedback gains applied to the position error of the payload. The closedloop system effectively reduces the standard deviation of the payload deflections to less than 10 cm over the range of operating conditions tested. A comparison of the predicted closed-loop behaviour of the dynamics shows favourable agreement to the experimental results, indicating that the tether actuation system is modeled appropriately. To improve on the PID controller tested in the field, various optimal control strategies are investigated that exploit the availability of our validated dynamics model. The optimal controllers, which are designed and simulated using linear time invariant versions of the dynamics model, result in approximately double the precision of the PID controller. The control system is improved further by incorporating a feedforward control input based on measurements of the primary disturbance force acting on the system. In general the advanced control techniques, tested in simulation, offer encouraging results that suggest the positioning system should exceed the requirements of the radio telescope application.</description><creator>Lambert, Casey.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Dynamics and control of a multi-tethered aerostat positioning system</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Casey Lambert, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fx719r386.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n009w647h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:w6634771f</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:46:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Hot tearing is a common defect during DC casting of some commercial aluminum alloys and can result in considerable productivity loss in the cast-house. In order to better understand the hot tearing, a novel technique, dubbed DCSS for Direct Chill Surface Simulator, has been developed to reproduce the cooling conditions at the mould/liquid metal interface and to generate the unique surface and sub-surface microstructure of the DC ingot. The apparatus has been designed also to apply and measure a tensile load and the surface strain. These mechanical quantities were then used to derive the stress-strain curves that best represent the material behaviour during solidification and its capacity to resist hot tearing. The present work describes the approach used to determine the mechanical resistance of three different aluminum-silicon binary alloys (AI-0.5wt%Si, Al-1.5wt%Si, and Al-2.5wt%Si). In addition, the present work covers the modeling of the heat transfer encountered during the test using commercial software (ProCAST(TM)) to better understand the temperature field upon solidification and tracking the solid fraction. Microstructure analyses were made to obtain various metallurgical quantities (e.g., grain morphology, size), physical measurements and thorough investigation of the torn surfaces. Information was used as inputs to the various models developed and used in the present work. A theoretical model was updated from previous work using more realistic metallurgical quantities. This research led also to the development of a probalistic model (cellular automata) to simulate the microstructure of the cast sample. The model has been used to determine a crack propagation coefficient (CPC) that was used in the theoretical model to better represent the hot tear propagation. Work to include even more complex coupled phenomena such as creep phenomena and microsegregation are not covered in the present scope of this work. Hypotheses are raised according to experimental work and observations made that suggest their most probable contributions. These studies have advanced to a certain degree the scientific understanding of hot tearing such as the inherent mechanical behaviour during solidification. In addition, the DCSS was used successfully to rank DC cast commercial wrought alloys in terms of hot tearing susceptibility.</description><creator>Langlais, Joseph.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</subject><title>Fundamental study of hot tearing mechanisms of aluminium-silicon alloys</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Joseph Langlais, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kh04dt61x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w6634771f</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kk91fr068</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:46:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis, new approaches to direct trace metals analysis of solid samples by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy were investigated using laser ablation and thermal vaporization systems for solid sample introduction of biological, environmental, and pharmaceutical samples. Laser ablation with inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was applied to pharmaceutical tablets. Precision of analysis depended on laser parameters and could be improved using signal ratios. The feasibility of using laser ablation-ICP-MS for detecting natural levels of mercury along a single human hair strand was also demonstrated. As well, the use of an induction-heating electrothermal vaporizer (IH-ETV) coupled to an ICP-MS was successful in determining mercury concentrations in a single human hair strand. Methodologies for multielement analysis of powdered hair were also explored using IH-ETV-ICP-MS. While calibration by reference hair materials showed promise, calibration methods by liquid standards were not suitable for any element. Detection limits achieved for most elements were below natural levels found in human hair. IH-ETV-ICP-AES was also applied to the analysis of analyze-laden chromatographic powder. This study showed potential problems that may arise due to the methodology taken to analyze such materials. Finally, recommendations for future investigations and methodologies for laser ablation and thermal vaporization are discussed.</description><creator>Lam, Rebecca.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Inductively coupled plasma spectrometry.</subject><subject>Trace elements -- Analysis.</subject><subject>Metals -- Analysis.</subject><subject>Laser ablation.</subject><title>Investigation of two solid sample introduction techniques for the analysis of biological, environmental, and pharmaceutical samples by inductively coupled plasma spectrometry</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Rebecca Lam, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dn39x5416.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kk91fr068</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kd17cz472</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:46:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Under consideration is the finite-size scaling of two thermomechanical responses of random heterogeneous materials. Stochastic mechanics is applied here to the modeling of heterogeneous materials in order to construct the constitutive relations. Such relations (e.g. Hooke's Law in elasticity or Fourier's Law in heat transfer) are well-established under spatial homogeneity assumption of continuum mechanics, where the Representative Volume Element (RVE) is the fundamental concept. The key question is what is the size L of RVE? According to the separation of scales assumption, L must be bounded according to d&lt;L&lt;&lt;LMacro where d is the microscale (or average size of heterogeneity), and LMacro is the macroscale of a continuum mechanics problem. Statistically, for spatially ergodic heterogeneous materials, when the mesoscale is equal to or bigger than the scale of the RVE, the elements of the material can be considered homogenized. In order to attain the said homogenization, two conditions must be satisfied: (a) the microstructure's statistics must be spatially homogeneous and ergodic; and (b) the material's effective constitutive response must be the same under uniform boundary conditions of essential (Dirichlet) and natural (Neumann) types. In the first part of this work, the finite-size scaling trend to RVE of the Darcy law for Stokesian flow is studied for the case of random porous media, without invoking any periodic structure assumptions, but only assuming the microstructure's statistics to be spatially homogeneous and ergodic. By analogy to the existing methodology in thermomechanics of solid random media, the Hill-Mandel condition for the Darcy flow velocity and pressure gradient fields was first formulated. Under uniform essential and natural boundary conditions, two variational principles are developed based on minimum potential energy and complementary energy. Then, the partitioning method was applied, leading to scale dependent hierarchies on effective (RVE level) permeability. The proof shows that the ensemble average of permeability has an upper bound under essential boundary conditions and a lower bound under uniform natural boundary conditions. To quantitatively assess the scaling convergence towards the RVE, these hierarchical trends were numerically obtained for various porosities of random disk systems, where the disk centers were generated by a planar Poisson process with inhibition. Overall, the results showed that the higher the density of random disks---or, equivalently, the narrower the micro-channels in the system---the smaller the size of RVE pertaining to the Darcy law. In the second part of this work, the finite-size scaling of effective thermoelastic properties of random microstructures were considered from Statistical to Representative Volume Element (RVE). Similarly, under the assumption that the microstructure's statistics are spatially homogeneous and ergodic, the SVE is set-up on a mesoscale, i.e. any scale finite relative to the microstructural length scale. The Hill condition generalized to thermoelasticity dictates uniform essential and natural boundary conditions, which, with the help of two variational principles, led to scale dependent hierarchies of mesoscale bounds on effective (RVE level) properties: thermal expansion strain coefficient and stress coefficient, effective stiffness, and specific heats. Due to the presence of a non-quadratic term in the energy formulas, the mesoscale bounds for the thermal expansion are more complicated than those for the stiffness tensor and the heat capacity. To quantitatively assess the scaling trend towards the RVE, the hierarchies are computed for a planar matrix-inclusion composite, with inclusions (of circular disk shape) located at points of a planar, hard-core Poisson point field. Overall, while the RVE is attained exactly on scales infinitely large relative to microscale, depending on the microstructural parameters, the random fluctuations in the SVE response become very weak on scales an order of magnitude larger than the microscale, thus already approximating the RVE. Based on the above studies, further work on homogenization of heterogeneous materials is outlined at the end of the thesis.

Hence, controller design aims at achieving an acceptable tradeoff between the conflicting goals of tracking or regulation performance versus robustness to plant uncertainty. This thesis investigates the tradeoff between robustness and performance for single-input single-output (SISO) systems and a tuning strategy for robust control of multiple-input multiple-out (MIMO) systems. Robust Hinfinity or mu controller design is based on a set of weighting functions representing performance specifications and uncertainty sets with the goal of achieving the desired trade off between performance and robustness. However, once the robust controller is implemented, its parameters are fixed and no tuning is possible. Yet, plant uncertainty arises from the inevitable discrepancy between the true plant and its model. Thus, the capability of tuning the controller is often required in order to re-establish a favorable tradeoff between performance and robustness on-line. Using a framework based on the internal model control (IMC) structure, we consider the fundamental tradeoff between performance and robustness by analyzing the tradeoff (|Wp(jo)|, | Wa(jo)|) where |W p(jo)| is the weighting for specifying performance and |Wa(jo)| is the maximum magnitude of the additive plant perturbation. In SISO systems and in certain MIMO systems, using only |Wp( jo)|, |Wa(jo)| and the nominal plant model Pn(jo) as input data, the optimal frequency response of the IMC controller Qopt(o) minimizing the structured singular value at each frequency can be obtained. This result provides the tradeoff (| Wp(jo)|, |Wa( jo)|) that yields the minimum of the structured singular value, which can help the control designer in the selection of appropriate weighting functions, and in judging different controller designs against the best achievable level of robust performance. Furthermore, the tradeoff theorem for SISO systems and the optimization algorithm for MIMO systems allow the computation of the optimal performance versus robustness tradeoff (rp(o),| Wa(jo)|), where r p(o) is the largest performance weight for which robust performance can be achieved for fixed |Wa( jo)|. On the other hand, the robust tuning requirement is achieved by fixing a |Wp(jo)| and adjusting |Wa(jo)| and therefore the tuned robust controller can be computed in a simple calculation which can be handled by plant engineers. MIMO plants with a linear fractional uncertainty model are considered as a more general case for robust tuning design requirement. The framework is to reconfigure an interconnection of the Q-parameter and the uncertainty weights into the IMC-based structure. By defining a matrix H that maps Q into K in a linear fractional transformation, K □ F1( H,Q), the robust controller K can be obtained via a Q-parameter. The tuning strategy of the MIMO robust control design depends on this IMC structure. A systematic design procedure is presented to achieve a sub-optimal Q-parameter along with a tuning technique. A numerical example illustrates the MIMO robust control design and tuning procedure based on the optimization.</description><creator>Duan, Yingxuan, 1966-</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Fundamental tradeoff between performance and robustness in control design : Yingxuan Duan.</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Yingxuan Duan, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6108vg69h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/00000425p</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5x21tk710</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:46:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis, we present a strongly coupled data fusion architecture within a Bayesian framework for modeling the bi-directional influences between the scene and object classification mechanisms. A number of psychophysical studies provide experimental evidence that the object and the scene perception mechanisms are not functionally separate in the human visual system. Object recognition facilitates the recognition of the scene background and also knowledge of the scene context facilitates the recognition of the individual objects in the scene. The evidence indicating a bi-directional exchange between the two processes has motivated us to build a computational model where object and scene classification proceed in an interdependent manner, while no hierarchical relationship is imposed between the two processes. We propose a strongly coupled data fusion model for implementing the feedback relationship between the scene and object classification processes. We present novel schemes for modifying the Bayesian solutions for the scene and object classification tasks which allow data fusion between the two modules based on the constraining of the priors or the likelihoods. We have implemented and tested the two proposed models using a database of natural images created for this purpose. The Receiver Operator Curves (ROC) depicting the scene classification performance of the likelihood coupling and the prior coupling models show that scene classification performance improves significantly in both models as a result of the strong coupling of the scene and object modules. ROC curves depicting the scene classification performance of the two models also show that the likelihood coupling model achieves a higher detection rate compared to the prior coupling model. We have also computed the average rise times of the models' outputs as a measure of comparing the speed of the two models. The results show that the likelihood coupling model outputs have a shorter rise time. Based on these experimental findings one can conclude that imposing constraints on the likelihood models provides better solutions to the scene classification problems compared to imposing constraints on the prior models. We have also proposed an attentional feature modulation scheme, which consists of tuning the input image responses to the bank of Gabor filters based on the scene class probabilities estimated by the model and the energy profiles of the Gabor filters for different scene categories. Experimental results based on combining the attentional feature tuning scheme with the likelihood coupling and the prior coupling methods show a significant improvement in the scene classification performances of both models.</description><creator>Ehtiati, Tina.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Computer vision -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Visual perception.</subject><subject>Bayesian statistical decision theory.</subject><title>Strongly coupled Bayesian models for interacting object and scene classification processes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Tina Ehtiati, 2007</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9s161b419.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5x21tk710</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6w924g853</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:46:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Earthworms have an important role in the decomposition of organic matter, mineralization of nutrients and physical mixing of soils. Despite a large number of laboratory and greenhouse-level studies investigating how earthworms modify soil properties and promote soil fertility, we lack reliable methods to scale-up and quantify earthworm contributions to nutrient cycling at the agroecosystem level. The objective of this thesis is to determine the influence of earthworm communities on nitrogen (N) transformations in soils and to quantify their contribution to nitrogen flux through soils for soybean and maize cropping systems of Quebec. Laboratory growth rates were used to predict how earthworm growth responded to seasonal fluctuations in soil temperature and moisture. The relationships between earthworm populations, soil-N pools and annual crop production were evaluated in a field experiment. When favourable conditions occurred in 2004 (temperatures &lt;20°C, and rainfall at least once a week), a positive relationship was found between earthworm numbers and the plant available-N, including soil mineral-N, microbial biomass-N and total-N removed in soybean grain. In 2005, soil conditions were unfavourable (temperatures &gt; 20°C and little or no rainfall) to earthworm survival and growth, and no relationship was found between earthworm populations, soil N pools and corn production. These data permitted me to make assumptions about earthworm activity and life histories under field conditions, which were used to estimate N flux through earthworm communities with two models. The models were tested for their sensitivity to varying parameter values within the range reported in the scientific literature. During a crop growing period with favourable climate conditions, a large earthworm population (100 g fresh weight biomass m-2 or greater) is predicted to cycle as much as 120 kg N ha-1. Model predictions were very sensitive to input parameters and did not correspond to the partial N budget calculated at the site. Accurate predictions of N mineralization by earthworms require more species- and site-specific parameter values. Further investigation using stable 15N isotopes as tracers would help us to follow the N transformations and evaluate the N flux mediated by earthworms at the field scale.</description><creator>Eriksen-Hamel, Nikita S.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Corn -- Yields -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Earthworms -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Soybean -- Yields -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Soils -- Nitrogen content -- Québec (Province)</subject><title>The contribution of earthworm communities to nitrogen cycling in agroecosystems of Québec /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Nikita S.

Le design expérimental de toutes les études décrites ici comprenait unparadigme de 'delayed-discrimination' et l'imagerie par résonance magnétiquefonctionnelle (IRMf). L'étude #1 visait à élucider les corrélats cérébraux de l'attention etde la localisation spatiale des stimuli vibrotactiles inoffensifs présentés à la faceantérieure de l'avant-bras droit. Dans cette étude, nous avons trouvé que des degrésélevés d'attention portée aux stimuli vibrotactiles étaient associés à des niveaux accrusd'activation dans plusieurs zones du cerveau. Dans l'étude #2, nous avons enquêté surla mémoire à court-terme des caractéristiques sensorielles (intensité et emplacement)de la chaleur douloureuse cutanée présentée à deux endroits (éminences thénar ethypothénar) de la paume de la main droite. Dans cette étude, les essais mémoire etcontrôle étaient présentés en bloc, ou de sorte que les participants pouvaient prévoir dequel type serait le prochain essai. Cette étude a révélé que la présentation des stimulidouloureux a évoqué une activation de différentes régions cérébrales que celles quiétaient activées lors de la rétention de l'intensité et de l'emplacement des stimulationsdurant l'intervalle inter-stimuli (liS); un processus que je qualifierai de mémoire à courtterme.Dans l'étude #3, nous avons également enquêté sur la 'mémoire à court-termedes aspects sensoriels de la chaleur douloureuse (tout comme dans l'étude #2), maisdans ce cas, les essais mémoire et contrôle étaient présentés de façon aléatoire. Danscette étude, nous avons trouvé que la perception de la douleur ainsi que la mémoire àcourt-terme de la douleur étaient traitées par un réseau de régions semblable. Laprévisibilité des essais mémoire et contrôle peut avoir contribué à ce résultat.</description><description>Distinct brain regions process innocuous vibration and cutaneous heat pain. The role of these areas in the perception of pain is still a matter of debate; and the role of these areas in the mediation of memory of somatosensory stimuli is uncertain and has not been studied with brain imaging in healthy human volunteers. All experiments described here, involved an experimental design, which included a delayed-discrimination paradigm and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In manuscript #1, we aimed at unraveling the cerebral correlates of attention and spatial localization of innocuous vibrotactile stimuli applied to the right volar surface of the forearm. In this study, we report that increased degrees of attention to the vibrotactile stimuli were associated with heightened levels of activation in several brain areas. In manuscript #2, we investigated the short-term memory for sensory aspects (intensity and location) of cutaneous heat pain delivered to two areas (thenar and hypothenar eminences) of the palm of the right hand. In this experiment, the memory and control trials were presented in blocks, whereby the subjects could predict what trials were going to follow. This study revealed that the presentation of painful stimuli evoked activation in different brain regions than those activated during the online maintenance (interstimulus interval or ISI) of the intensity and spatial features of those stimuli; a process, which I will refer to short-term memory. In manuscript #3, we investigated again short-term memory for sensory aspects of heat pain (as in manuscript #2), but in this case, the memory and control trials were presented in a randomized order. In this study, we found that the perception and short-term memory of pain were processed by a comparable network of areas. The predictability of the memory and control trials may have contributed to these findings.</description><creator>Albanese, Marie-Claire.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Somatosensory evoked potentials.</subject><subject>Brain -- Psychophysiology.</subject><subject>Magnetic Resonance Imaging.</subject><subject>Memory -- physiology.</subject><subject>Brain -- Magnetic resonance imaging.</subject><subject>Pain -- Physiological aspects.</subject><subject>Memory -- Physiological aspects.</subject><title>FMRI evidence of memory representations of somatosensory stimuli in the human brain</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Marie-Claire Albanese, 2007</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xd07gx87k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8w32r954m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7h149t80c</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:46:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Energy modulated electron therapy (EMET) is a promising treatment modality that has the fundamental capabilities to enhance the treatment planning and delivery of superficially located targets. Although it offers advantages over x-ray intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), EMET has not been widely implemented to the same level of accuracy, automation, and clinical routine as its x-ray counterpart. This lack of implementation is attributed to the absence of a remotely automated beam shaping system as well as the deficiency in dosimetric accuracy of clinical electron pencil beam algorithms in the presence of beam modifiers and tissue heterogeneities. In this study, we present a novel technique for treatment planning and delivery of EMET. The delivery is achieved using a prototype of an automated "few leaf electron collimator" (FLEC). It consists of four copper leaves driven by stepper motors which are synchronized with the x-ray jaws in order to form a series of collimated rectangular openings or "fieldlets". Based on Monte Carlo studies, the FLEC has been designed to serve as an accessory tool to the current accelerator equipment. The FLEC was constructed and its operation was fully automated and integrated with the accelerator through an in-house assembled control unit. The control unit is a portable computer system accompanied with customized software that delivers EMET plans after acquiring them from the optimization station. EMET plans are produced based on dose volume constraints that employ Monte Carlo pre-generated and patient-specific kernels which are utilized by an in-house developed optimization algorithm. The structure of the optimization software is demonstrated. Using Monte Carlo techniques to calculate dose allows for accurate modeling of the collimation system as well as the patient heterogeneous geometry and take into account their impact on optimization. The Monte Carlo calculations were validated by comparing them against output measurements with an ionization chamber. Comparisons with measurements using nearly energy-independent radiochromic films were performed to confirm the Monte Carlo calculation accuracy for 1-D and 2-D dose distributions. We investigated the clinical significance of EMET on cancer sites that are inherently difficult to plan with IMRT. Several parameters were used to analyze treatment plans where they show that EMET provides significant overall improvements over IMRT.</description><creator>Al-Yahya, Khalid S.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Electron beams -- Therapeutic use.</subject><subject>Radiation dosimetry.</subject><title>Energy modulated electron therapy : design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel method of treatment planning and delivery</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Khalid S.

The objective of this work was to investigate the nature of phenolic compounds in oil-bearing plants and the effects of phenolic compounds on protein isolates from soybean and flaxseed. Proteins were isolated from full-fat and defatted soybean and flaxseed using sodium hydroxide extraction and isoelectric precipitation. Free phenolic compounds were extracted from the oil-bearing plants and protein isolates using methanol; for bound phenolic compounds the oil-bearing plants and proteins were subjected to basic and acidic hydrolysis followed by methanol extraction. Total free and bound phenolic compounds were determined by spectrophotometric analysis. Reversed phase-HPLC was used for separation of individual phenolic compounds, which were identified by mass spectrometry (MS). Molecular characteristics and biological properties of the protein isolates were studied using RP-HPLC, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and MS. Thermal and gelation properties of protein isolates were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and rheometry. Generally, bound phenolic compounds (20%-30% of total phenolic content) were higher in protein isolates from flaxseed than in protein isolates from soybean (10%-20% of total phenolic content). With flaxseed protein isolates, removal of phenolic compounds showed little effect on the electropherotic behavior of the proteins or the protein subunits. Native-PAGE. SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC for the peptides profiles of hydrolyzed protein isolates from both full-fat and defatted soybean revealed the removal of free and bound phenolic compounds affect on the biological properties of protein isolates. Removal of free and bound phenolic compounds affected the thermal stability and gelation properties of protein isolates from flaxseed and soybean.</description><creator>Alu'datt, Muhammad Hussein.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Flaxseed.</subject><subject>Phenols.</subject><subject>Soybean.</subject><title>Phenolic compounds in oil-bearing plants and their interactions with oilseed protein isolates</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Muhammad Hussein Alu'datt, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r781wm44g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/028711255</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xp68km32z</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:46:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Gradient-based junctions form key features in such applications as object classification, motion segmentation, and image enhancement. Asymmetric junctions arise from the merging of an odd number of contour end-points such as at a 'Y' junction. Without an asymmetric representation of such a structure, it will be identified in the same category as 'X' junctions. This has severe consequences when distinguishing between features in object classification, discerning occlusion from disocclusion in motion segmentation and in properly modeling smoothing boundaries in image enhancement. Current junction analysis methods include convolution, which applies a mask over a sub-region of the image, and diffusion, which propagates gradient information from point-to-point based on a set of rules. A novel method is proposed that results in an improved approximation of the underlying contours, through the use of asymmetric junctions. The method combines the ability to represent asymmetric information, as do a number of convolution methods, with the robustness of local support obtained from diffusion schemes. This work investigates several different design paradigms of the asymmetric tensor diffusion algorithm. The proposed approach proved superior to existing techniques by properly accounting for asymmetric junctions over a wide range of scenarios.</description><creator>Arseneau, Shawn.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Computer vision.</subject><subject>Convolutions (Mathematics)</subject><title>Representing junctions through asymmetric tensor diffusion</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Shawn Arseneau, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vt150p27v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xp68km32z</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2f75rd115</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:47:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study examines the communication habits of the pilgrim Church with focus upon Vatican documents on mass media and social communication. Attention is given to the historical context of Vatican Councils I and II. As the Church engaged modernity, it shifted ecclesial organization from closed to become open. This study documents the importance of sociology, especially communication theory and cybernetics for Catholicism today. It is argued that the pivotal event in the Roman Catholic Church's self-exploration for self-awareness and realization was the Second Vatican Council. At that Council, the Church re-examined itself and its own identity to come to grips with the modern world. The teachings of the Council were concerned mainly with the pastoral dimension of the Church and its self-realization. Reflexivity is an important theme of this study as it speaks about understanding the very identity of the modern Church. It is explained that the process of communication within the Roman Catholic Church is itself linked to this insight of reflexivity. The first chapter shows that behind the pilgrim Church lies an emerging vision of the threefold offices of priest, prophet, and king. The history behind the Roman Catholic Church's transition from the First to the Second Vatican Council is provided. John Henry Cardinal Newman influenced nineteenth-century Catholic theology with his own study of the threefold office. In chapter four we return to the threefold office and examine the contribution of John Paul II. It includes an analysis of how the politics of the magisterium shapes Catholic social teaching. Chapter two examines the text and context of the Second Vatican Council's pastoral decree "Inter Mirifica". Chapter three provides a documented history of the Vatican's Pontifical Council for Social Communication and its teachings. Chapter five develops major tenets of a critical analysis of the communication of the post-Vatican II Church: attention is given to the discursive aspects of religious authority, argumentation, bureaucratization, and market culture. Chapter six takes a step towards examining the pragmatics of contemporary Vatican teaching. This study concludes that there are three basic sociological and theological aspects of the pilgrim Church. These include a ritual approach to communication, the generational experience of Catholics and their respective attitudes toward Church teaching, and the important link in the faith's praxis between reflexivity and forming habits of communication.</description><creator>Kappeler, Warren.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Communication -- Religious aspects -- Catholic Church.</subject><subject>Christian sociology -- Catholic Church.</subject><title>Communication habits for the pilgrim Church : Vatican teaching on media and social communication</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Warren Kappeler, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3t945w128.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2f75rd115</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Religious Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1831cq01j</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:47:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The dissertation examines the close but overlooked relationship between male poetry societies and the sharp rise of literary courtesans in the late Ming. I attempt to identify a particular group of men who devoted exclusive efforts to the promotion of courtesan culture, that is, urban dwellers of prosperous Jiangnan, who fashioned themselves as retired literati, devoting themselves to art, recreation, and self-invention, instead of government office. I also offer a new interpretation for the decline of courtesan culture after the Ming-Qing transition. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the social-cultural context in which late Ming courtesans flourished. I emphasize office-holding as losing its appeal for late Ming nonconformists who sought other alternative means of self-realization. Chapter 2 examines the importance of poetry by courtesans in literati culture as demonstrated by their visible inclusion in late Ming and early Qing anthologies of women's writings. Chapter 3 examines the life and poetry of individual courtesans through three case studies. Together, these three chapters illustrate the strong identification between nonconformist literati and the courtesans they extolled at both collective and individual levels. In Chapter 4, by focusing on the context and texts of the poetry collection of the courtesan Chen Susu and on writings about her, I illustrate the efforts by both male and female literati in the early Qing to reproduce the cultural glory of late Ming courtesans. However, despite their cooperative efforts, courtesans became inevitably marginalized in literati culture as talented women of the gentry flourished. This dissertation as a whole explores how male literati and courtesans responded to the social and literary milieu of late Ming Jiangnan to shed light on aspects of the intersection of self and society in this floating world. This courtesan culture was a counterculture in that: (1) it was deep-rooted in male poetry societies, a cultural space that was formed in opposition to government office; (2) in valuing romantic relationship and friendship, the promoters of this culture deliberately deemphasized the most primary human relations as defined in the Confucian tradition; (3) this culture conditioned, motivated, and promoted serious relationships between literati and courtesans, which fundamentally undermined orthodox values.</description><creator>Xu, Sufeng.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Courtesans -- China -- 17th century.</subject><subject>Women and literature -- China -- History -- 17th century.</subject><subject>Chinese poetry -- 17th century -- History and criticism.</subject><subject>Women authors, Chinese -- 17th century.</subject><title>Lotus flowers rising from the dark mud : late Ming courtesans and their poetry</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Sufeng Xu, 2007</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/736669012.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1831cq01j</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of East Asian Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n009w648s</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:47:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation presents a new perspective on the history of conservation in North America. In contrast to historiography that locates conservation-oriented approaches to the North American environment as the product of late-nineteenth-century concerns within Canada and the United States, this study links wildlife conservation in Quebec directly to longstanding European land tenure, estate management, and associational strategies. Through a range of materials including state documents, associational records and personal and family papers, I show how advocates of fish and game protection in the province drew heavily on Old World customs and traditions, particularly those of British landowners, who displayed in their varied social, economic, and political commitments an ongoing engagement with improvement. These 'patrician sensibilities,' I argue, formed the basis of the regulatory system that developed in Quebec during the period 1850-1914, first on the remote salmon rivers of the north shore and Gaspe peninsula, and by the First World War on the bulk of the province's best and most easily accessible hunting and fishing territories. In addition to the regulatory strategies that developed during this period, the dissertation deals with forms and limits of resistance on the part of aboriginal and non-aboriginal subsistence, commercial, and sport hunters and fishers. The dissertation's major contribution lies in its demonstration of the longstanding patterns that underpinned the development of conservation strategies in North America. Class and gender are central to the project, and it also has important implications for our understanding of civil society and state formation.</description><creator>Ingram, Darcy.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Wildlife conservation -- Québec (Province) -- History.</subject><title>Nature's improvement : wildlife, conservation, and conflict in Quebec, 1850-1914</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Darcy Ingram, 2007</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8s45qd94b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n009w648s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of History</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wm117t023</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:47:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Central planners and citizens, conservatives and reformers, 19th-century liberal statisticians and today's advocates of sustainable development all draw on statistics for the elaboration and communication of political visions. Yet, this striking phenomenon has so far largely escaped the attention of political philosophers in the English-speaking world. As politics has come to be informed and shaped by statistics, there is a need to scrutinize omnipresent statistical accounts for their political vision. Taking as its political vision the idea of society as a fair system of co-operation, this thesis offers a series of essays towards a political philosophy of statistics. To this end, the thesis retrieves the statistical macro-scopic point of view in the vision of co-operation as spelled out by John Rawls and contrasts this uptake of statistics with the one in Martin Heidegger's phenomenology of everydayness. The goal is to make explicit the implicit role of statistics in the philosophical reflection of these thinkers. This thesis then argues for the place of statistics in a system of co-operation in terms of accountability institutions. It also engages the contemporary political issue of sustainable development, which has seen the rapid development and use of statistics. It argues that the Index for Sustainable Development is not a measure of sustainable development, but rather a debunking index. As such, it is a stepping stone for more systematic accounts, such as the eco-space proposal. For these proposals to make a positive contribution to sustainable development, they must be situated within a vision of large-scale political society.</description><creator>Ziegler, Rafael.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Political statistics.</subject><subject>Sustainable development -- Statistics.</subject><subject>Statistics -- Philosophy.</subject><subject>Responsibility -- Political aspects.</subject><title>Visions need accounts : essays on political perception and action in a statistical age</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Rafael Ziegler, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/08612s835.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wm117t023</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Philosophy</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gq67jw30c</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:47:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Current water-cooling technology used in the metallurgical industry poses a major safety concern. In addition, these systems are expensive to operate and result in significant energy losses. The purpose of the research presented in this thesis was to develop a viable cooling system based on novel heat pipe technology which addresses these problems. This technology employs boiling as the means to store and transfer heat energy. The large heat extraction capacity of the device is owed to two design features: firstly, a separate return line that generates a column of liquid working fluid which drains into the evaporator by gravity, and secondly, a helical flow modifier in the evaporator that stabilizes annular two-phase flow. A full-scale copper tapblock and launder were designed with water-based heat pipe cooling systems. These systems were successfully tested under industrial heat loading conditions, using a gas burner to simulate the heat loads. The tapblock cooling system was able to dissipate 142 kW per heat pipe, at heat fluxes as high as 2.4 MW/m2. These values are the largest to date using the novel water-based heat pipe technology. The launder system was the first to incorporate horizontal heat pipes, as well as have multiple evaporators feeding a single condenser. The cooling systems used in both experiments were fundamentally safer than watercooling systems, being operated at low pressures and with only several kilograms of water exposed to the heat source. The cooling water requirements of these systems represent a reduction of 80-95% compared to conventional water-cooling, with increased potential for energy recovery. During the testing, dry-out and film boiling were identified as the main limitations. It was found that film boiling occurs when the flow in the evaporator is not great enough to generate a helical motion. The dry-out limitation was achieved when the velocity of the flow within the evaporator was too great, causing a large pressure gradient that opposes the gravity head of the return line. Both of these limitations are related to the configuration of the evaporator, i.e. the return line and the flow modifier. A methodology was developed to model the evaporator numerically using computational fluid dynamics. This methodology can be used to understand how the design parameters of the evaporator affect the flow patterns during operation.</description><creator>Navarra, Pietro, 1979-</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Heat pipes.</subject><subject>Metallurgical furnaces -- Cooling.</subject><title>Heat pipe cooling of metallurgical furnace equipment</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Pietro Navarra, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xw42nd14h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gq67jw30c</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:c534fs88q</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:47:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation draws from and contributes to many traditions within the (interdisciplinary) discipline of communication studies. Serving the two primary objectives of the examination of the figure of the BMX freestyle cycling Pro and the analysis of the role of the magazines within this particular culture or field in the construction and maintenance of this figure, this project brings together studies of cultural intermediaries, magazine history, advertising history and theory, subcultures, audiences, commodification, cultural industries, celebrity, stars and professional athletes. The culture of BMX freestyle cycling is an interesting and heretofore unexamined phenomenon, and a focused examination allows the exploration and investigation of larger questions within the discipline. As such, this dissertation provides an informed interpretation of the culture of BMX freestyle, allows the examination of a number of other issues concerning the mediation of cultural practices, and suggests a theory of the special-interest magazine, thus contributing substantively to various literatures. Special-interest magazines are a part of a larger system and industries within which the ultimate goal is the sale of commodities. At the same time, they function as a site of credibility within a larger field, both conferring star status on particular individuals and approving particular commodities that are being offered to the readers. Special-interest magazines construct and sell audiences to advertisers, create star systems, propose candidates for stardom, help build image careers, contribute substantially to a "star currency" within the particular field, negotiate (i.e.; mediate) tensions between the advertisers, the stars, and the readers, help organize the time of a culture and work to infuse it with a sense of vitality through the punctual and ritualistic appearance of novel content, assist the consumer with their desires for commodities and stars by standing as catalogues of commodities (serving to educate newcomers in the protocol of the culture), provide new financial opportunities (such as the commodity form of the photo contingency), and in their complicity with the needs of those that provide their primary source of revenue, give more value to the advertising dollar in the construction of editorial content that could be seen as advertising.</description><creator>Nelson, Wade Gordon James.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Bicycle motocross.</subject><subject>Mass media -- Social aspects.</subject><title>Reading cycles : the culture of BMX freestyle</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Wade Gordon James Nelson, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/73666902b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fs88q</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Art History and Communication Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:m039k9459</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:47:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>From the artistic experience of Saint-Denys Garneau, who decided to devote himself to painting and writing at the beginning of the 1930's, to the poetry and essays on art of Claude Gauvreau, Roland Giguere, Jacques Brault or Robert Melancon, Quebec's poetry maintains a fertile dialogue with the art of painting. Whatever form it takes, discourse on art allows the poet to reinforce or refine aesthetic sensibilities, to question the links or the disparities between texts and images, but also to conceive a theory about visual perceptions. Despite all that separates these two expressive modes, literature and painting both produce "visibility": even if some pictures are not figurative or some poems do not contain imagery, visual arts, beyond the topics or themes they provide to writers (landscape, portrait, still life, etc.), contribute to the development of "ways of seeing", ways of perceiving sensitive reality and of inserting oneself as a subject in the world. This is particularly true in the works of the three poets around which the main parts of this study are centered: Saint-Denys Garneau, for whom painting is a way of "learning to see" (apprendre a voir), Roland Giguere, whose poetic and artistic works share a desire to "give to see" (donner a voir), and finally Robert Melancon, who borrows from painters ways to "make see" (faire voir). By using notions and concepts that come from disciplines close to Aesthetics, this work proposes to circumscribe those "ways of seeing" and to assess how painting acts as a "seeing school" (ecole du regard) for these three authors. More broadly, since discourse on painting can be found throughout Quebec's modern poetry, this study also constitutes a point of view on the history of poetry in Quebec since Saint-Denys Garneau. Keywords: Quebec poetry, painting, Aesthetics, visual perception, history of literature.</description><creator>Papillon-Boisclair, Antoine.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>Giguère, Roland, 1929- -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><subject>Garneau, Saint-Denys, 1912-1943 -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><subject>Mélançon, Robert -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><subject>Painting in literature.</subject><title>L'école du regard : poésie et peinture chez Saint-Denys Garneau, Roland Giguère et Robert Melançon</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Antoine Papillon-Boisclair, 2006</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7m01bq69m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m039k9459</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xd07gx88v</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:47:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation explores the factors shaping American foreign policy toward secessionist crises since the end of the Cold War. The main research puzzle is the following: Why is it that, facing the resurgence of secessionist movements in the last 15 years, the United States reacted to it by supporting the territorial integrity of central states in some cases (Serbia, Somalia, Moldova), while recognizing the independence of secessionist states in other cases (Croatia, Eritrea, East Timor)? How can this apparent inconsistency be explained? This dissertation argues that regional stability is the main U.S. interest when responding to secessionism. It asserts that, when facing a secessionist crisis, the American government will choose the option (i.e. supporting state integrity or secessionism) that provides the greatest expected gain of regional stability depending on the evolution of the crisis. This explains why the American government's response to secessionism fluctuates from one case to another. The performed qualitative analysis, which includes cases taken from two regional settings, the Balkans and the Horn of Africa, confirms the effect of the regional stability factor on the formulation of U.S. foreign policy. It shows that the fluctuation of the U.S. response is not caused by political inconsistency but by a coherent set of regional stability interests. The research also proceeds to the measurement of two competing arguments---namely ethnic politics and business interests. Case studies show that these domestic arguments fail to account for the research puzzle under investigation and that the regional stability argument consistently offers better explanations and predictions. Thus, this dissertation challenges liberal claims that domestic politics define foreign policy.</description><creator>Paquin, Jonathan.</creator><date>2006</date><subject>United States -- Relations -- Balkan Peninsula.</subject><subject>United States -- Relations -- Africa, Eastern.</subject><subject>Balkan Peninsula -- History -- Autonomy and independence movements.</subject><title>Recognizing the obvious? : the United States response to secessionist ambitions since the end of the Cold War</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>© Jonathan Paquin, 2006</rights><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6h440x853.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xd07gx88v</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:m326m598c</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:47:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>La voie de la polarité cellulaire planaire (PCP), conservée de la mouche aux vertébrés, contrôle plusieurs processus cellulaires au cours du développement embryonnaire telle que la neurulation qui permet le développement du cerveau et de la moelle épinière. Des mutations des gènes de la PCP chez la souris causent une forme très sévère des anomalies du tube neuronal (ATN), le craniorachischisis, suggérant ainsi que la PCP est un régulateur important de la fermeture du tube neuronal. Les ATN sont la deuxième malformation congénitale la plus courante chez les humains. Vu que l'étiologie des ATN chez les humains est complexe et implique à la fois des facteurs génétiques et environnementaux, l'identification des gènes/facteurs responsables s'avère difficile. Toutefois, les études récentes ont mis en évidence que les mutations des gènes de la PCP, Vangl1 et Vangl2, chez les humains contribuent à la pathogenèse de certains cas d'ATN (~2%), ce qui suggère que d'autres gènes de la même voie peuvent aussi être tenus responsable de certains cas d'ATN chez les humains. Les études de knock-out, dans les modèles animaux, d'un autre gène de la PCP, Fuzzy, ont révélé un large éventail de phénotypes dont les ATN, l'extension convergente aberrante, la signalisation Sonic hedgehog (Shh) anormale et les défauts dans la ciliogenèse. Dans ce projet, nous avons étudié le rôle de Fuzzy dans le développement du tube neuronal chez les mammifères ainsi que des mécanismes moléculaires Fuzzy-dépendant impliqués dans la formation du cil primaire. Nous avons examiné des mutations dans le gène Fuzzy dans une cohorte humaine d'ATN provenant d'Italie et identifié cinq substitutions non synonymes d'acides aminés associées à des maladies. Nous avons conçu de nouvelles méthodes pour déterminer l'impact des mutations sur la ciliogenène. Nous reportons, dans cette étude, qu'au moins une mutation dans le gène Fuzzy affecte la formation du cil primaire ainsi que sa longueur et les mouvements directionnels des cellules. Par conséquent, nous proposons que les mutations du gène Fuzzy peuvent être tenus responsable de certains cas d'ATN chez les humains.Dans ce travail, nous avons établi que Fuzzy recrute et/ou séquestre Rab8, un régulateur essentiel de la ciliogenène, et nous suggérons que la perte des cils observée chez les mutants de Fuzzy est en partie causée par l'absence du Rab8 au niveau du cil. De plus, nous avons découvert un nouveau mécanisme moléculaire via lequel Fuzzy affecte la signalisation de Wnt. Cette étude montre que Fuzzy interagit avec DVL2, une protéine de la PCP. Ainsi, Fuzzy recrute et délivre DVL2 au niveau du cil primaire limitant ainsi la voie canonique de la PCP.</description><description>The planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway is evolutionally conserved from flies to vertebrate; it controls multiple cellular processes during embryonic development. One of such processes is neurulation, which gives rise to the brain and spinal cord. Mutations in the PCP genes in mice cause a very severe neural tube defect (NTD), called craniorachischisis, establishing that the PCP pathway is an important regulator of neural tube closure. NTDs are the second most common congenital malformation in humans. Since the etiology of NTDs in humans is complex and involves both genetic and environmental factors, the identifying of the causative genes/factors has been very difficult. Recently, however, mutations in the PCP genes, Vangl1 and Vangl2, were reported to contribute to the pathogenesis of a subset (~2%) of human NTDs, suggesting that other genes in the same pathway may account for some cases of NTDs in humans. Knockdown studies of another PCP gene, Fuzzy, in model animals revealed a wide spectrum of phenotypes including NTDs, defective convergent extension, abnormal Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signalling, and defects in ciliogenesis. In this project, we studied the role of Fuzzy in neural tube development in mammals as well as Fuzzy-dependent molecular mechanisms that contribute to the generation of primary cilium. We screened a human NTD cohort from Italy for mutations in Fuzzy and identified five non-synonymous disease-associated amino-acid variants. We have designed novel methods to ascertain an impact of mutations on ciliogenesis. We report here that Fuzzy mutations affect formation of primary cilium and ciliary length and impact directional cell movements. We therefore propose that mutations in Fuzzy may account for the subset of NTDs in humans. We established that Fuzzy delivers Rab8, an essential regulator of ciliogenesis, to the cilium and propose that loss of cilia seen in Fuzzy mutant is, at least partly, due to the loss of Rab8 at the cilium. In addition, we uncovered novel molecular mechanisms whereby Fuzzy affects canonical Wnt signalling. We report here that Fuzzy interacts with DVL2, a PCP protein. Fuzzy both recruits and delivers DVL2 to the primary cilium, consequently limiting the canonical PCP pathway.</description><creator>Seo, Jung Hwa</creator><contributor>Elena Torban (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2012</date><subject>Biology - Genetics</subject><title>Mutations in the Planar Cell Polarity gene, Fuzzy, are associated with neural tube defects in humans</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vd66w389n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m326m598c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2f75rd026</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:47:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Le transport d'éléments nutritifs tels que le fer et la vitamine B12 au travers de la membrane externe (ME) des bactéries Gram-négatives tel Escherichia coli, dépend d'un complexe protéique intégral de la membrane cytoplasmique (MC): TonB-ExbB-ExbD. La force proton motrice qui traverse la MC est transmise par ce complexe aux récepteurs de la ME  qui dépendent de TonB pour leur interaction. Les structures des domaines C-terminal périplasmique de TonB et ExbD  ont été déterminées à haute résolution; mais, de l'information structurelle manque toujours sur les régions de ces deux protéines recouvertes par la MC et sur ExdB. La stœchiométrie du complexe, l'organisation indigène de TonB-ExbB-ExbD et le mécanisme moléculaire de la translocation des protons demeurent indéterminés. Pour étudier les propriétés du complexe d'ExbB-ExbD d'E. coli, nous avons cloné exbB et exbD dans différents vecteurs et optimisé leur expression. Par la chromatographie d'affinité de métal immobilisé, la co-purification de ExbB avec ExbD démontrait des interactions in vitro. La chromatographie d'exclusion stérique a identifié un complexe protéine-détergent d'une masse moléculaire approximative de 350 kDa pour ExbB-ExbD et de 270 kDa pour ExbB seul. L'utilisation d'un microscope électronique (MÉ) en coloration négative révèle des particules de taille uniformes d'approximativement 10 nm de diamètre pour le complexe d'ExbB-ExbD. Des reconstructions en 2D et 3D ont été générées pour le complexe d'ExbB-ExbD et d'ExbB seul. Ces reconstructions sont basées sur un total de 45,321 particules pour le complexe d'ExbB-ExbD et de 72,327 pour ExbB assemblées par un système informatique pour la sélection de particules individuelles (SIGNATURE).  ExbB démontrait des particules d'approximativement 9 nm de diamètre et, tout comme le complexe d'ExbB-ExbD, semble suggérer un arrangement pentamérique. L'analyse préliminaire du complexe d'ExbB-ExbD par cryo-MÉ confirme les observations par MÉ en coloration négative. En obtenant la structure du complexe d'ExbB-ExbD, nous pouvons amélioré notre compréhension des mécanismes moléculaires du transport des nutriments rares parmi les bactéries Gram-négatives.</description><description>Transport of scarce nutrients such as iron and vitamin B12 across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria depends on an integral cytoplasmic membrane protein complex: TonB-ExbB-ExbD. The proton motive force across the cytoplasmic membrane is transduced by this complex to TonB-dependent outer membrane receptors. High resolution structures of the C-terminal periplasmic domains of TonB and ExbD have been solved; structural information is lacking for the membrane-spanning regions of these two proteins and for ExbB. The stoichiometry of the complex, the native organization of TonB-ExbB-ExbD and the molecular mechanism of proton translocation remain undetermined. To investigate properties of ExbB-ExbD from Escherichia coli, we cloned exbB and exbD into different vectors and optimized expression of the recombinant proteins. By immobilized metal affinity chromatography in dodecyl maltoside, ExbB co-purified with His6-tagged ExbD, thereby demonstrating their interactions in vitro. Size-exclusion chromatography identified a protein-detergent complex with a molecular weight of approximately 350 kDa. The molecular weight of His6-tagged ExbB, also purified in dodecyl maltoside, was approximately 270 kDa. Negative-staining electron microscopy (EM) revealed uniform particles approximately 10 nm in diameter for the ExbB-ExbD complex.  By low-dose single-particle analysis from high-resolution EM images, 2D averages and 3D reconstructions were generated for the ExbB-ExbD complex and for ExbB alone. A total of 45,321 particles for the ExbB-ExbD complex and 72,327 particles for ExbB alone were collected by a computational single-particle selection system (SIGNATURE). Computational single particle analysis for resolution extension (SPARX) refined the 3D reconstructions.  His6-tagged ExbB showed particles approximately 9 nm in diameter and matched pentameric organization for the ExbB-ExbD complex. Preliminary analysis of the ExbB-ExbD complex by cryo-EM confirmed findings by negative-staining EM.  Knowing the structural organization of the ExbB-ExbD complex will provide insights into the mechanism of energy-dependent nutrient import in bacteria.</description><creator>Cottreau, Andrew</creator><contributor>James W Coulton (Internal/Supervisor)</contributor><date>2012</date><subject>Biology - Microbiology</subject><title>High-resolution electron microscopy of energy-transducing proteins of «Escherichia coli»</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fn107316k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2f75rd026</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h702qb42g</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:47:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this study was to determine if any differences in gaze characteristics existed between accurate and inaccurate shooting groups. A total of twelve subjects participated in this study; five of which were placed in the AS group (accurate) and seven in the IS group (inaccurate) post-hoc. The task required the subjects to receive a pass from an assistant, followed by the execution of a wrist shot at one of two targets on net. Each subject performed 90 total shots which included 60 shots with a time pressure condition and 30 shots without any time constraints. Passes were directed to either the forehand or backhand of the subject for the time pressure task, while during the task with no time pressure passes were only directed to the forehand. Each subject executed the protocol wearing an eye tracking system which identified their eye-line-of-gaze which was recorded at 60 Hz. The results indicated that for the forehand reception / time pressure condition the AS group gazed at the net and target (combined time) for a significantly longer (p &lt; 0.049) duration (0.191 s ± 0.020) prior to the shot release, than the IS group (0.136 s ± 0.017). The backhand reception / time pressure condition yielded similar results regarding this gaze characteristic. The results of the forehand reception / time pressure condition also revealed that the AS group was able to shift their gaze from the puck (on the ice) to the net in a significantly shorter (p &lt; 0.014) duration of time (0.157 s ± 0.023) than the IS group (0.238 s ± 0.019). When no time constraints were placed on the subjects, no significant differences in gaze characteristics were found between the two accuracy groups. However, the AS group was able to significantly improve (p&lt; 0.042) their accuracy results in the no time pressure condition (M=57.3% to 70.7%) while the IS group (M=28.1% to 30.0%) was not able to do so. The results of the present study suggest that accurate shooters in ice hockey are able to transfer their gaze to the net in a significantly shorter duration of time which ultimately allows them to gaze at the net and target for a significantly longer duration of time in comparison to an inaccurate shooter. These factors in combination with the kinematics of the shooter may help to determine the accuracy of a shooter in ice hockey. Verifying if these same differences exist, or if there are any more discrepancies when a goaltender is present in the net may be the next step for future studies.</description><description>Le but de cette étude était de déterminer si des différences existaient entre des joueurs de hockey de précision différente au niveau des caractéristiques visuelles lors de tirs du poignet. Un total de douze sujets ont participé à cette étude; cinq ont été placés dans le groupe AS (précis) et sept dans le groupe IS (inexactes) post-hoc. La tâche des sujets consistait à recevoir une passe à partir d'un assistant, suivie par l'exécution d'un tir des poignets à l'une des deux cibles sur le filet. Chaque sujet a effectué 90 tirs au total, parmi ces derniers 60 étaient effectuer avec une limite de temps (pression) et 30 tirs sans aucune contrainte de temps. Chaque sujet a exécuté le protocole portant un modèle 501 Head Mounted Eye Tracker (Applied Science Laboratories, Bedford, MA) qui a permis d'identifier et d'enregistrer la ligne de vision, enregistré à 60 Hz. Les résultats indiquent que pour la condition sous pression, le groupe AS regardait la cible à atteindre pour une plus longue durée que le groupe IS avant la rondelle ne quitte le bâton. Les résultats ont également révélé que le groupe AS a été capable de déplacer leur regard de la rondelle (sur la glace) au filet plus rapidement. Quand aucune contrainte de temps n'était imposée aux sujets, aucune différence significative dans les caractéristiques des regards ont été trouvés entre les deux groupes de précision. Cependant, le groupe AS a été en mesure d'améliorer considérablement la précision de leurs résultats lors des lancers sans pression. Pour de futures études, il serait important de déterminer si ces mêmes différences existent, ou s'il ya des écarts plus grand lorsqu'un gardien de but se trouve devant le filet. </description><creator>Goodreau, Robin</creator><contributor>David J Pearsall (Internal/Cosupervisor2)</contributor><contributor>Rene A Turcotte (Internal/Supervisor)</contributor><date>2012</date><subject>Health Sciences - Recreation</subject><title>The use of vision during offensive ice hockey skills</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5t34sp47p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h702qb42g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8s45qd82j</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:47:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Les octocoralliaires sont des espèces sessiles marines fondatrices, communes dans des milieux très actifs du Pacifique Est Tropical (PET). Bien qu'elles dominent dans leurs communautés et entretiennent de très fortes relations avec les autres espèces, il existe très peu d'études sur leur biologie et leur écologie. Cette thèse est la première tentative d'étude de la biologie de base et de la structure des communautés octocoralliaires présentes dans la partie panaméenne du PET: le Parc National Coiba, zone chaude d'une grande diversité en espèces endémiques.Le premier chapitre passe en revue la littérature scientifique sur les octocoralliaires du PET et les compare aux études faites dans d'autres régions. Ce chapitre révèle de manière évidente l'absence d'études sur ces communautés écologiquement importantes et suggère des études futures. Le second chapitre étudie la dynamique de la population de base (naissance, mortalité et survie) de 15 espèces d'eau peu profonde dans 6 genres, le taux de croissance de quatre espèces, et identifie des espèces avec des stratégies écologiques « r » et « k ». Ce chapitre fait également état d'un important déclin de population dans tous les sites étudiés. Le troisième chapitre analyse la structure de quatre communautés octocoralliaires. Différents descripteurs écologiques sont utilisés (Diversité Rényi, distribution d'abondance par rangs, spectre d'abondance et analyse de similitudes par ordre) pour évaluer si la structure de la communauté a changé durant le déclin de population mentionné dans le chapitre deux ou suite à une perturbation anthropogénique aiguë. Le déclin de population n'a changé la structure de la communauté en aucun des sites étudiés. Cependant, après la perturbation, la récupération des communautés s'est effectuée d'une manière différente en chacun de ces sites. Les graphiques RAD et Rényi ont décrit la tendance du changement, l'analyse de similitudes par ordre l'ampleur du changement, et le spectre d'abondance la nature de ce changement.</description><description>Octocorals (Alcyonacea) are sessile marine foundation species common in very active environments in the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP). Although they are a dominant part of the community and have strong interspecific relationships, there have been very few studies of their biology and ecology. This thesis is the first attempt to study the basic biology and community structure of shallow water octocorals present in Coiba National Park in Pacific Panama, a hotspot for species richness and endemism in the TEP.  The first chapter reviews the existing scientific literature on octocorals in the TEP and compares this literature to studies in other regions. This Chapter demonstrates the lack of research on these ecologically important communities and suggests future studies.  Chapter 2 studies basic population dynamics (recruitment, mortality, and survivorship rates) for 15 shallow water octocoral species in 6 genera, the growth rate of 4 species of different genera, and identifies « r » and « k » selected species. Chapter 2 also reports a significant natural population decline in all study sites. Chapter 3 presents an analysis of the structure of four octocoral communities. This Chapter uses different community ecological descriptors (Rényi diversity profiles, Rank Abundance Distribution Plots (RAD), Abundance Spectrums, and ordination analysis of similarities) to evaluate changes in community structure during the population decline reported in Chapter 2 or after a punctuated anthropogenic disturbance. The population decline was not found to have changed the structure of the community, however, different recovery trajectories were observed after the disturbance. RAD and Rényi plots described the trend of the change, ordination analysis of similarities described the extent of the change, and abundance spectrums described the nature of the change.</description><creator>Gómez Gómez, Catalina</creator><contributor>Andrew Gonzalez (Supervisor1)</contributor><contributor>Hector Guzman (Supervisor2)</contributor><date>2012</date><subject>Biology - Ecology</subject><title>Population dynamics and community structure of octocoral species (coelesterate: anthozoa: octocorallia) at Coiba National park, pacific Panama</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2v23vx98p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8s45qd82j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gf06g655f</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:47:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>La néphrine, un composant clé du diaphragme de fente, subit des modifications post-traductionnelles dans le réticulum endoplasmique (RE). Des mutations de la néphrine provoquent une protéinurie. Nous avons examiné les effets des mutations faux-sens de la néphrine sur le repliement de cette protéine dans RE, sur son trafic cellulaire et sur l'induction de réponse déplié protéines (UPR). Le type sauvage (TS) de la néphrine et les mutants d'ADNc, I171N, G270C, S366R, S724C et R743C ont été exprimés dans des cellules 293T ou cellules glomérulaires épithéliales (GECs) par une transfection transitoire. Association de néphrine avec le chaperon de RE, la calnexine, a été étudiée par la co-immunoprécipitation. Activation de l'UPR a été évaluée par l'étude de l'expression du chaperon du RE, Grp94, la phosphorylation de la sous-unité (eIF2α) du facteur 2α d'initiation de la traduction eucaryote, et l'induction de C/EBP homologue de la protéine-10 (CHOP), ainsi que l'activation du facteur-6 de la transcription (ATF6)- l'activité luciférase du gène rapporteur. Tous les mutants de la néphrine ont montré l'association accrue avec la calnexine, par rapport au TS de la néphrine. Les mutants I171N et le G270C ont augmenté l'expression du Grp94 dans les cellules 293T, ont stimulé  l'ATF6-activité luciférase dans les deux cellules 293T et GECs. Néphrine S366R et S724C ont tendance à induire l'UPR, mais les changements dans le Grp94 et l'activité ATF6-luciférase ont été moins cohérents. Le mutant R743C n'a pas amélioré l'expression de Grp94, ni l'ATF6-activité luciférase. Tous les mutants de la néphrine n'ont pas augmenté ni la phosphorylation d'eIF2α, ni l'expression de CHOP. La microscopie en immunofluorescence a montré la localisation du TS néphrine à la membrane plasmique, tandis que les mutants I171N et S366R à la partie périnucléaire, colocalisés avec la calnexine. Par ailleurs, les deux mutants de néphrine ont provoqué l'agrégation du chaperon du RE, la calréticuline, par rapport au TS. Le traitement des cellules avec la castanospermine (qui réduit l'interaction de la néphrine avec la calnexine) a entraîné la localisation d'une partie des mutants I171N et S366R de la néphrine à la membrane plasmique. Ainsi, certains mutants de néphrine montrent une déficience du repliment de la protéine dans RE et activent la branche ATF6 de l'UPR. L'induction de chaperons du RE peut représenter une réponse cytoprotectrice, permettant aux cellules de résister aux lesions protéotoxique. Le blocage de l'interaction de la néphrine avec la calnexine resulte à un retour partiel au TS de certains mutants de néphrine, et donc à la localisation de néphrine à la membrane plasmique.</description><description>Nephrin, a key component of the filtration slit diaphragm, undergoes post-translational modifications in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mutations in nephrin lead to proteinuria. We examined the effects of missense mutations in nephrin on protein folding in the ER, cellular trafficking, and induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Wild type (WT) nephrin and the I171N, G270C, S366R, S724C and R743C mutant cDNAs were expressed in 293T cells or glomerular epithelial cells (GECs) by transient transfection. Association of nephrin with the ER chaperone, calnexin, was studied by co-immunoprecipitation. Activation of the UPR was assessed by monitoring expression of the ER chaperone, Grp94, phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2α subunit (eIF2α), and induction of C/EBP homologous protein-10 (CHOP), as well as activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6)-luciferase reporter activity. All nephrin mutants showed increased association with calnexin, compared with WT nephrin. The I171N and G270C mutants increased expression of Grp94 in 293T cells, and stimulated ATF6-luciferase activity in both 293T cells and GECs. Nephrin S366R and S724C tended to induce the UPR, but changes in Grp94 and ATF6-luciferase activity were less consistent. The R743C mutant did not enhance Grp94 expression, nor ATF6-luciferase activity. All nephrin mutants did not increase eIF2α phosphorylation, nor CHOP expression. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed WT nephrin at the plasma membrane, while the I171N and S366R mutants were perinuclear, colocalized with calnexin. Moreover, the two nephrin mutants induced aggregation of the ER chaperone, calreticulin, compared with WT. Treatment of cells with castanospermine (which reduces the interaction of nephrin with calnexin) resulted in a portion of nephrin I171N and S366R appearing at the plasma membrane. Thus, certain nephrin mutants show impaired folding in the ER, and activate the ATF6 branch of the UPR. Induction of ER chaperones may represent a cytoprotective response, allowing cells to withstand proteotoxic injury. Blocking the interaction of nephrin with calnexin results in a partial rescue of certain nephrin mutants to the plasma membrane. </description><creator>Drozdova, Tetyana</creator><contributor>Andrey V E Cybulsky (Internal/Supervisor)</contributor><date>2012</date><subject>Biology - Molecular</subject><title>Nephrin missense mutations altez cellular trafficking and induce endoplasmic retioulum stress</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pv63g4205.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gf06g655f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):37875</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
