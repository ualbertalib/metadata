as well as the need for safety screening for side effects. The present study reports the results of the investigation of effects of buspirone in 57 primary chronic alcoholics, using a double blind method with a placebo control group. Buspirone was administered in doses of 20 mg/day after a two-week wash-out period during which patients in both groups received placebo capsules. After a further two weeks of the study, the buspirone dose was increased to 40 mg/day until completion of the investigation after twelve weeks. Five out of 36 subjects, who completed the study, became abstinent. Detailed characteristics of the study group were obtained, including socio-demographic data, alcohol consumption, Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST), Alcohol-Use-Inventory (AUI), Drinking Behavior Interview (DBI), and psychometric assessment: Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) and Hopkins Symptoms Checklist 90-Revised (SCL-90-R). Statistical analysis of the results was carried out using multivariate analysis of covariance on repeated measures. The HAM-A scale results were improved significantly in patients receiving buspirone. Marked improvement was also observed in Interpersonal Sensitivity Scale (a subscale of SCL-90-R). MENTALIM subscale of AUI demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the buspirone group, when compared to patients receiving placebo. The validity of self reports on alcohol consumption by patient was confirmed by a change in liver enzyme levels: Gamma-Glutamyl Transpeptidase (GGT), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALAT) and the results of the Edwards Hardship Scale. The scores on HAM-A and MADRS scales were higher among the drop-outs than in those who completed the study. The side effects of buspirone were minimal and a good tolerance of the drug was observed.</description><creator>Malec, Elizabeth Anna</creator><contributor>Dongier, M.

A maximum mean concentration of 67 mg/l occurred in the forest floor, which decreased to 11 mg/l in the B horizon, as DOC was sequestered in the soil. High DOC concentrations were measured in an ephemeral stream draining the upland, as a result of saturated overland flow, and the leaching of litter and woody material. Porewater DOC concentrations decreased with depth in two bogs. The porewater DOC was comprised primarily of acidic fractions (70 to 87%), with a predominance of hydrophobic acids. The bogs were significant sources of DOC, exporting between 17.2 and 29.4 g DOC/m$ sp2$ over the study period. In 1993, a bog was flooded simulating the creation of a hydroelectric reservoir, and resulting in significant increases in porewater DOC concentrations at the surface. A maximum surface concentration of 223 mg/l was measured in late September. The flooding of the bog also resulted in significant increases in DOC concentrations in the draining waters, with the outflow of the watershed increasing from a mean of 20.5 mg/l in 1992, to 14.7 mg/l in 1993.</description><creator>Matos, Laudalino</creator><contributor>Moore, Tim (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Wetlands -- Ontario, Northern</subject><subject>Soils -- Carbon content -- Ontario, Northern</subject><subject>Carbon cycle (Biogeochemistry) -- Ontario, Northern</subject><title>The dynamics and chemistry of dissolved organic carbon in upland and wetland catchments, Experimental Lakes Area, Ontario /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3t945s09b.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/70795896j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7w62f964k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:19:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The gene encoding chicken growth hormone (GH) was isolated from a chicken genomic library. The size of the gene was 4 kb. It was digested with PstI and subcloned into pUC18. Three of the PstI fragments were used for restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) analysis at the GH locus in two chicken strains (fat and lean line). Four polymorphic sites were detected using a PstI fragment (PII) as a probe. One polymorphism was located at a SacI restriction site (PS1), and three at MspI sites (PM1, PM2 and PM3). A method based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed for detecting polymorphisms at PM3 site. A fragment of 823 base pairs which contained the PM3 polymorphic site was amplified. Three genotypes (+/+,$-$/$-$ and +/$-$) were distinguished by examining the MspI digested PCR products in either agarose or polyacrylamide gel. Ten anonymous cDNA clones were also isolated from a chicken liver cDNA library and used for RFLPs analysis. Three of these clones were found to be able to detected RFLPs at MspI sites in chicken strains (strain 7, 8, 9, 8R, S and K) indicating that a high frequency of genes are polymorphic and can be used as markers in mapping experiments. One of the three clones was present on a haploid genetic element. Segregation analysis showed that the inheritance of this haploid gene was determined by the genotype of the female parent.</description><creator>Liu, Ni</creator><contributor>Kuhnlein, Urs (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Chickens -- Physiology.</subject><subject>Genetic polymorphisms.</subject><subject>Chickens -- Genome mapping.</subject><title>Detection of trait-associated restriction fragment length polymorphisms in chicken</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pr76f477f.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7w62f964k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Animal Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jd472x647</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:19:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study explored the utilization and evaluation of formal support services among caregivers of the elderly who suffer from dementia. Data for the analyses were obtained from the Canadian Study on Health and Aging, funded by Health and Welfare Canada (1991-92). The sample consisted of 327 informal caregivers of non-institutionalized elderly with dementia. Results indicated that formal support service users cared for demented elderly who had greater ADL/IADL functional limitations, reported more burden, tended to be husbands, tended not to live with the care recipient, reported less informal support, and tended to live in the Prairie region. They also tended to perceive their health to be better than a year ago. Service users' reports indicated that utilization of in-home services was considerably greater than that of out-of-home services. Out-of-home respite and caregiver support groups had the largest number of barriers to use. The most common barriers identified for all services included cost and perceived lack of effectiveness.</description><creator>Lett, Judy</creator><contributor>Gooding, B. A.

Twenty-seven adolescents living with mothers who had persistent chronic pain were matched on age, gender and maternal education with 26 adolescents whose mothers had no chronic illness. The two groups of adolescents completed questionnaires measuring their levels of depression (Beck Depression Inventory), life satisfaction (Cantril Ladder) and perceived level of maternal support (Maternal Support Questionnaire). Mothers completed questionnaires measuring pain intensity (VAS), pain distress (VAS), disability (3 item questionnaire) and depression (Beck Depression Inventory). The two adolescent groups did not differ in terms of depression, life satisfaction or perceived maternal support. Maternal support, however, was demonstrated to be related to the level of depression and life satisfaction for adolescents whose mothers had chronic pain. The results of this study demonstrated that the health status of the adolescent whose mothers had chronic pain was comparable to those adolescents whose mothers had no chronic illness. Possible explanations for the results may be related to the sample, measurement issues or the age of the adolescents. The study extends current research findings by considering maternal support to be associated with the maternal chronic pain experience and the adolescent health status.</description><creator>Bees, Fiona</creator><contributor>Rowat, Kathleen (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Sociology, Individual and Family Studies.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Nursing.</subject><subject>Psychology, Developmental.</subject><title>Depression, life satisfaction and perceived maternal support in adolescents of mothers with chronic pain</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1r66j221x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t435gf23h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Nursing</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5999n4622</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:19:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>One postulated prerequisite for phenotypic plasticity to evolve in a population is gene flow among its members. To test this hypothesis, I compared the phenotypic plasticity of 3 congeneric nut-sedges (Cyperus: Cyperaceae) that are similar in size, cohabit sandy beaches, yet differ in their reproductive strategies. Cyperus strigosus reproduces sexually by seed, C. dentatus asexually by bulbils, tubers, and rhizomes, and C. esculentus by a combination of sexual seed and asexual rhizomes and tubers. I predicted that C. strigosus and C. esculentus would be most plastic due to their potential for gene migration, while the asexual C. dentatus would be less plastic. Progeny arrays from nine genotypes of each species were grown in a series of eight environments in growth chambers. I measured 15 vegetative and reproductive traits at maturity. Analysis of covariance indicated a plastic response to the environment for all traits as well as genetic variation in phenotypic plasticity for all but vegetative allocation traits. Indices of plasticity for each genotype were highest for C. esculentus genotypes for vegetative traits and for C. strigosus genotypes for reproductive traits. These results support the hypothesis that non-zero gene migration enables the evolution of phenotypic plasticity.</description><creator>Aldous, Allison</creator><contributor>Waterway, Marcia J.

HPC injection is a promising therapy for several diseases but a heterologous production system would be preferred over purifying HPC from human plasma because of its low concentration (4-5 $ mu$g/ml). A cDNA clone coding for HPC was inserted downstream of the CaMV 35S promoter and of a dimer of the CaMV 35S promoter. Tobacco plants were transformed using Agrobacterium and a binary vector strategy. Kanamycin resistant plants were regenerated and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay determined that HPC, in crude plant extracts, accounted for up to 0.03% of plant soluble proteins. HPC was found to be expressed by R$ sb1$ seedlings suggesting successful integration of the T-DNA into plant genome. A partial protein purification system was developed in order to enrich the protein mixture for HPC. HPC was found to bind tightly at pH 6.0 to Fast Flow Q Sepharose resin.</description><creator>Piché, Christian.</creator><contributor>Fortin, Marc G.

Based on an experimental mouse model, the hypothesis was that a human recessive susceptibility gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 and has a major effect on the development of disease. Clinical and genetic data from family members were used in linkage analyses with the lod score method to test for co-segregation of genetic markers and the susceptibility trait. Evidence for linkage to the candidate chromosome region was obtained for a large, multiplex Aboriginal Canadian family who experienced a tuberculosis epidemic in 1987-1989. Evidence against linkage was found in 16 smaller families from Colombia and Hong Kong, who had endemic but not epidemic exposure. The results suggested that the function of a chromosome 2 susceptibility gene may be more important in an epidemic situation.</description><creator>Boothroyd, Lucy J.

In June and August 1992, six golden eagles, of which 5 adults (4$ rm sp{o}$ + 1 sex unknown), were caught and fixed with transmitters in order to follow their movements over one year. The golden eagles fed on various animal species, i.e. 8 mammals, 15 birds and one fish, during the breeding season, however Canada geese (Branta canadensis) were the main item in their diet. Four of the adult eagles undertook their fall migration in October 1992. The other adult eagle died of an unknown cause while the fate of the nestling could not be determined. All the migratory birds moved south to the United States, but they used different migration routes. The four golden eagles reached their wintering grounds in November and December, 1992. After a three to four month stay in the wintering area, three eagles undertook their spring migration in March 1993. When returning to the breeding area, two of the eagles followed the same migration routes used in fall, while the third one flew off course to the west into Ontario.

Protein isolates with different microstructures (crystalline and amorphous) were prepared from four varieties of Phaseolus beans; white kidney bean and navy bean (P. vulgaris), and large lima and baby lima beans (P. lunatus). The protein isolates were subjected to tryptic hydrolysis at various time intervals, and the effect of hydrolysis on the functional properties of the protein isolates was studied, using bovine casein as control. Reversed phase HPLC with UV detection was used to generate peptide maps of the tryptic hydrolysates, and electrospray mass spectrometry was used to characterize the peptide profile of the protein hydrolysates. There was no difference between the susceptibility of the crystalline and amorphous protein isolates to tryptic hydrolysis, however, the hydrolytic products of the crystalline isolates showed higher solubility and functional properties compared with those of the amorphous isolates. Limited hydrolysis markedly improved the functional properties of both crystalline and amorphous protein isolates. The effect of hydrolysis on the functionality of the bean protein isolates was higher compared with casein. In general the hydrolysates of the bean protein isolates showed higher functional properties than casein and its hydrolysates. Reversed phase HPLC peptide mapping of the tryptic digests and ESI/MS of the RP-HPLC fractions showed structural and compositional difference between crystalline and amorphous protein isolates prepared from the same bean variety. The results also showed that off-line ESI/MS, and ESI/MS/MS of RP-HPLC fractions of the tryptic hydrolysates could be used for the structural characterization of the protein isolates.</description><creator>Yeboah, Faustinus Kwabena</creator><contributor>Alli, I.

Reductions in NH$ sb3$ volatilization have significance both in economic and ecological aspects. Calcium lignosulphonate (CaLS), an acidic, water-soluble organic waste product of the pulp and paper industry, is expected to reduce NH$ sb3$ volatilization from liquid hog (Sus scrofa dometicus) manure (LHM) and consequently increase fertilizer value of LHM. Reduction of NH$ sb3$ loss from LHM was studied using added CaLS at 0, 6% 12% and 18% CaLS (based on fresh LHM weight) during 21 d incubation. Cumulative losses of NH$ sb3$-N ranged between 0 to 46% of initial total N. Compared to untreated LHM, the 6% CaLS treatment control N loss for 7 d and promoted N loss thereafter, while 12% and 18% CaLS treatments effectively reduced N losses throughout the 21 d incubation period. The N availability and the effect of CaLS-LHM mixtures on ryegrass (Lolium multiform Lamb.) growth were assessed on two soils mapped as St. Amable (sandy loam) and Ste. Rosalie (clay loam) from eastern Canada. Calcium lignosulphonate showed adverse effect on ryegrass plant growth, while as an amendment it did not reduce the effectiveness of LHM-N for ryegrass dry matter yield (DMY) and chemical composition at application rate up to 12% of LHM for the sandy loam soil and 18% of LHM for the clay loam soil. These findings suggested that CaLS may be used as an amendment for controlling N losses from animal manures.</description><creator>Zou, Guangyong</creator><contributor>Fyles, J. W.

MV is one of the members of Paramyxoviridae, a family of non-segmented negative-stranded RNA viruses family. We have expressed the MV NP in procaryotic systems and by in vitro translation. We have created a number of carboxy-terminal deletions of NP to use in mapping the domains involved in RNA and protein binding. We have transcribed the 5$ sp prime$ end antigenome sequences (positive leader) in vitro. We have metabolically labeled viral and MV-infected cellular proteins. We have applied different RNA-protein and protein-protein binding assays in order to study the postulated binding. We were not able to unequivocally detect specific binding between NP and the RNA. However, we have observed significant binding between NP and each of three MV-specific proteins NP, P, and M. Furthermore, we have found that the carboxy terminus of NP is important in this binding. Deletions in that domain will abolish M binding, and further deletions towards the amino terminus will abolish P binding, and eventually NP binding. Successively larger carboxy-terminal deletions first abolish NP binding to M, then to P, and then eventually to itself.</description><creator>Batal, Rami</creator><contributor>Brieolis, Dalius J.
