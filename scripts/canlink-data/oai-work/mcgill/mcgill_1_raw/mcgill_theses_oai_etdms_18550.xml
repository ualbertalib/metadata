Tests on various windscreens of cylindrical and spherical shape, composed of single and multiple sections, indicate that the most effective windscreens are those constructed of several layers of separated sheer nylon cloth. The supporting framework for the cloth as well as the cloth itself, have a marked effect on both the reduction of wind noise and on the attenuation of the desired sound.</description><creator>Bredahl, Arve.</creator><contributor>Howes, F.

Space charge spreading due to the repulsion of the like charges in the beam must be eliminated by an external focusing field. Sets of widely spaced electrostatic or magnetostatic lenses (15) have been used where charge densities were low, while uniform longitudinal magnetic fields (2, 15) have been used where charge densities were high. J.R. Pierce (5), in a Letter to the Editor of the Journal of Applied Physics, September 1953, suggested that spatially alternating magnetic fields could be used to advantage in place of the uniform magnetic fields.</description><creator>Blevis, Earl.

The rate at which it proceeds depends on several factors, the most significant probably being the temperature, for a combustible mixture will not usually burn unless the temperature is raised to a critical value (other factors constant). Closely associated with “spontaneous ignition temperature”, as it is called, is the phenomenon of ignition delay, which represents the time interval between the attainment of conditions suitable for combustion and the onset of ignition.</description><creator>Bernard, Ernest.

The specialization of labour and the large-scale use of capital have not only led to a manifold increase in labour productivity, but they have also raised the problem of maintaining price stability and avoiding severe depressions and inflations. In contrast, the economics of underdeveloped countries are characterized by stability. We may say, therefore, that economic equilibrium and stability are not synonymous with prosperity.

Second, the heat given out in the sorption process can be measured either by direct calorimetry or indirectly determined from the variation of pressure with temperature for constant amount sorbed.</description><creator>Barton, Stuart.

Elève de Roger Martin du Gard, ami et protégé d'André Gide, i l mourut subitement en Russie avant d'avoir pu donner toute sa mesure. Faussement étiqueté "populiste", Dabit dépasse ses contemporains des années 1930-1936 par le témoignage objectif et frémissant de son œuvre romanesque, Il a subi, depuis vingt ans, un injuste oubli que notre travail a l'ambition de réparer.</description><creator>Andrews, Oliver.</creator><contributor>Launay, J.

The oldest exposed rocks are sedimentary and are presumed to be Ordovician in age. Overlying these are Silurian sediments, which contain the iron and manganese deposits of the Woodstook area. The Ordovician and Silurian sediments indicate deposition in an unstable marine geosynclinal environment. Granite and allied rocks intruded the Silurian and older strata during the Devonian period.</description><creator>Anderson, Francis. D.</creator><contributor>Clark, T.

Young ‘Ali's primary education followed the custom of his class. Under a pedagogue he read a few Persian classics, learned to read -- without understanding the Qur’an in Arabic, and absorbed the routine of the religious rituals practised in his Sunni home.</description><creator>Watson, William.

From where he lay on his cot he could see the clock through the open door. As it was only four o'clock in the afternoon, neither the beginning nor the end of night, the sailing ship which followed round the hours on its own turning disc had not yet poked its bow-sprit up; it rode quite over-turned above the numeral six, nor would it begin to right itself again until the hour came round to six.</description><creator>Waterhouse, John.</creator><contributor>Files, H.

It is imperative, therefore, to clarify the terminology at the outset. In experiments on time estimation, the subject (S) is required to make judgments about temporal durations. The duration that S is asked to judge is called the standard. The estimate of the standard made by S is called the judgment.</description><creator>Waksberg, Helene.</creator><contributor>Bindra, D.

One may say that the development of civilization and the evolution of all its main attributes (economic, political, cultural, and social) rest upon man-made means of communication. Among the many factors which have conditioned and at the same time shaped the history of mankind, transportation and communication have been not causes, but certainly essential elements of the progressive development of society.</description><creator>Vlasic, Ivan.</creator><contributor>Cooper, J.

This phenomenon was reported to occur upon the immersion of an ampule of pure degassed cyclohexane in a dry ice-acetone freezing mixture. A solid crust first formed on the surface of the liquid, while a thin sheath of glassy solid appeared below the liquid level next to the walls of the ampule - the rest of the cyclohexane remaining liquid.</description><creator>Verschingel, Roger.

"An economic study of the Schuman plan", we would first like to introduce the reader to the Schuman plan itself. When we refer to an economic plan, we generally have in mind a program of action aiming at certain modifications of the economy for a given period of time. The Schuman plan is not a plan of this kind. It is a treaty, which has been signed for a duration of 50 years. It represents in fact the Constitution which will regulate the action of a new independent power "The European Community of Coal and Steel", and also provides a statement of the basic principles which are to regulate and inspire the policy of this new power.</description><creator>Velay, Clément.
