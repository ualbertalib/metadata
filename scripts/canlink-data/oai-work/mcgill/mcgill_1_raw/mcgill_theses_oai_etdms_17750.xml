Recognition of its significance dates from the publication of a paper by Moruzzi and Magoun (1949) on electrical stimulation of the brainstem reticular formation, and from the appearance of Lindsley's "activation theory" of emotion in the psychological literature.

There are those people who have regarded the system as one of nuisance-value only, and those who have regarded it as a blessing, and yet others who have regarded its principles and objectives as being synonymous with the best of colonial principles and practices and, for that reason, no innovation.</description><creator>Chidzero, Bernard T.G.</creator><contributor>Pratt, R.C.

The particular problem investigated was the control of a servomechanism with one nonlinearity, the saturation of the driving element. As a result of the work a twofold purpose was fulfilled. An insight was gained into the problem of utilizing nonlinear control to optimise the transient response, and test equipment and procedures were developed to facilitate complete testing of all aspects of servomechanisms.</description><creator>Caswell, Charles F.</creator><contributor>Pavlasek, T.J.F.

This isomer decays with a half-life of 15.5 hours predominantly by electron capture to Br76 and is followed by a strong Ml gamma ray of 45.6 kev in energy. Indeed the conversion lines for six gamma rays were observed to decay with the 15.5 hour half-life. An isomeric transition in Kr76 was not definitely recognized among the many weak conversion lines.

By comparison with Lower Ordovician strata elsewhere, the Beekmantown in southern Quebec is relatively unfossiliferous. As a result, interest in the group has been slight. This study is a dissertation on the stratigraphy and palaeontology of the Beekmantown group as exposed in the Quebec portion of the St. Lawrence Lowlands.</description><creator>Byrne, Anthony W.</creator><contributor>Stearn, C.
