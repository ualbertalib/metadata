The proportion of p,p'-DDT appearing in the crude product is constant during the progress of a given reaction, and is independent of all factors other than temperature. The intermediate in the formation of p,p'-DDT from chloral and chlorobenzene is 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2,2- trichloroethanol. Unreacted chloral remains after all the DDT is formed when the theoretical amounts of chloral and chlorobenzene are used. Excess chlorobenzene raises the yield of DDT based on chloral. The major side-reaction competing with DDT formation is the sulfonation of chlorobenzene.[...]</description><creator>Garmaise, David Lyon.</creator><contributor>Boyer, R.

During the later part of the reaction, a more rapid disappearance rate occurred. The rate of disappearance increased with decreasing chain-length of the mercaptan. The intrinsic viscosities and the molecular weight distribution of polymers obtained at different conversions generally agreed with the activity of each mercaptan as a modifying agent.

The aseptic nature, however, often is not assured until the meningitis has uneventfully passed, v\^en the causative agent is attributed then to blood in the subarachnoid space. Of great concern to many neurosurgeons is a recurrent form of aseptic meningitis following certain intracranial procedures. Finlayson and Penfield in 1941 postulated that the cause of this form of meningitis is due to the presence of breakdown products of a blood clot entering the subarachnoid space. They stated that after removal of a neoplasm or atrophic epileptogenic lesion, a blood clot is left behind, which soon undergoes degeneration and liquefaction.[...]</description><creator>Jackson, I. </creator><contributor>Penfield, W.

It has a low toxicity for the sheep and has proved of great commercial value in the production of wool and mutton. The potential consumption of Australia and New Zealand was estimated by Gordon(63) in 1941, to be 1500 tons per year and the present day consumption on the North American continent is enormous. The value of any anthelmintic must be appraised in terms of the benefit derived by the host from the prevention of parasitic infestation. For instance, no one has shown that adult tapeworms are pathogenic and a drug which removes tapeworms, while of scientific interest, is commercially unimportant. However, many nematode species have been shown to have a harmful effect upon various hosts and a large number of these are removed by phenothiazine.[...]</description><creator>Harpur, Robert Peter.</creator><contributor>Denstedt, O.

Whey has approximately the following composition: fat .3%, protein .8%, lactose 5.1%, ash .6%, and water 93%. It may be seen that the valuable components of whey constitute a relatively minor portion of the total material. Due to this fact, transportation of whey is a costly item and with cheese factories widely dispersed throughout the country, the accumulation of the liquid at one centre is an expensive proposition.[...]</description><creator>Hare, John Harold.</creator><contributor>McFarlane, W.

Since all these areas are associated with either Wacouno lake or Wacouno river, the entire area mapped will in future be referred to as “The Wacouno Region”. The region lies between 65 and 120 miles north northeast ot Sept-Iles (Seven Islands) a town on the North Shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The map areas are aligned in a north-south direction, each straddling the railroad which joins Sept-Iles to the iron ore deposits of Schefferville (Knob Lake). The most southerly area, 65 miles north of the coast, is the Wacouno River Area, bounded by longitudes 65° 40’ and 66° 00’ and by latitudes 51° 00’ and 51° 15’. To the northeast lies the middle map-area, the Wace Lake area, bounded by longitudes 65° 30’ and 65° 50’ and by latitudes 51° 15’ and 51° 30’. Directly to the north is the third map-area, the Mule Lake Area, bounded by the same longitudes as the Waco Lake Area and by latitudes 51° 30’ and 51° 45’. Finally, the fourth area lies adjacent to the eastern boundary of the Waco Lake Area and is bounded by longitudes 65° 15’ and 65° 30’ and by latitudes 51° 08’ and 51° 31’. All these longitudes read west and all the latitudes read north (see Diagram 1).[...]</description><creator>Emo, Wallace B.</creator><contributor>Kranck, E.

Land is farmed and mined in order to produce natural resources. Out of these resources industries are created. Some of the products go directly to the consumer, others are transformed into capital goods. The latter serve as materials for further processes of production, the output of which is again divided between capital and consumer goods. In a modern economy this development goes on through many stages which may be called the diversification of production. The final result in all cases is the production of goods and services which can be used in order to satisfy human wants. In other words, all economic activity is directed towards the creation of a supply of economic values which is able to satisfy the demand of the consumers.[...]</description><creator>Guter, Ernest.</creator><contributor>Higgins, B.

Values of surface conductivity were computed from the conductance data obtained for the different fibres, using an equation which described the complex internal pore structure of the pad. An alternate modal of the electrical double layer was proposed to account for the difference between the experimentally determined values of surface conductivity and those predicted by classical double layer theory. This model was used to calculate approximate values for surface roughness and for the total surface potential of the fibre. An investigation of the low-frequency resistance dispersion effect previously observed in pads of swollen fibres was carried out.</description><creator>Mossman, Carolyn Emily.</creator><contributor>Mason, S.

This acid is also obtained from the ozonolysls of vitamin A, Karrer (30). The mode of attack by ozone appears to be the primary formation of a heterocyclic five membered ring, at one of the double bonds, resembling a peroxide and epioxide. Recently, Hunter and Williams (28) have succeeded in converting carotene to vitamin A aldehyde by the carefully controlled oxidation with hydrogen peroxide, and subsequently converting this to the alcohol by reducing it with aluminium isopropoxide. Their yield (0.5 per cent) would not appear to justify their assumption that two molecules of vitamin A aldehyde are formed from one molecule of carotene.</description><creator>Goss, George Charles Louis.</creator><contributor>McFarlane, W.

Of these mothers 78 participated in Child Study Groups sponsored by the Parent Education Department of the Mental Hygiene Institute in conjunction with the Quebec Federation of Home and School Associations. The remaining 32 mothers never participated in any Child Study Group. These two groups were compared in order to determine the effect of experience in Child Study Groups on parental concepts. The study also seeks to obtain knowledge concerning sources of information most frequently used by mothers and the direct opinion of mothers regarding their conception of the value of Child Study Groups. The data was collected by the use of a Sentence Completion Inventory and by an interview. It was found that the values of mothers who had attended Child Study Groups differed from those who had not attended such groups. There was also an indication that mothers’ values varied according to differences in religious and socio-economic background. Evidence revealed that mothers were helped in their roles as mothers through attendance at Child Study Groups.</description><creator>Brodeur, Ruth.</creator><creator>Cooper, Shirley.</creator><creator>Folliott, Betty.</creator><creator>Peritz, Fraidie.</creator><creator>Lubin, Sheila.</creator><creator>Kouri, Eileen.</creator><creator>Wu, Franees.</creator><date>1955</date><subject>Social Work.</subject><title>Parental values towards children’s behaviour.</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/js956k09s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c534fs03d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wp988p081</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T18:07:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>[...] With these thoughts in mind, the present work on five species of Canadian deciduous trees, which fall into three distinct groups as regards changes in water content, has been undertaken.

E. Kuntz and Mr. G. M. Malakatis was made up of Cestodes, Trematodes and Nematodes from ten genera of rodents. This thesis deals with two of these genera of rodents and has for its subject matter the nematode parasites of the house mouse (Mus musculus) and the house rat (Rattus rattus) in Egypt.  [...] The study of parasites found in the house mouse and the house rat has more than a purely scientific significance, for the direct association of these rodents with man, his dwellings, and his domesticated animals, gives them a prominence in his economic and public health aspects of life. This prominence is shared by only a few other animals. Not only do rats and mice carry arthropods which serve as vectors of human parasites but also they carry parasites directly to man and his domesticated animals by contamination of food and drink; in fact, they also share certain parasites or very closely related forms with man. Their economic importance is more or less inseparable from the health problems which their closeness to man and his domestic animals brings. A solution of the problems arising from this close association depends in part on a knowledge of the parasites harboured by these rodents. This thesis is concerned with the classification of some of the common nematode parasites found inhabiting the digestive tract of the Egyptian house rats (Rattus rattus) and house mice (mus musculus).</description><creator>Mensah-Dappa, W.

Few others are more vital to the welfare of the whole population. The sanitation of the physical environment, the control of communicable infections, the education of the individual in personal hygiene and the organization of medical and nursing services for the early diagnosis and preventive treatment of certain diseases - all these health functions and many more are the concern of the various levels of government in Canada. [...] The purpose of this thesis is to examine and compare the pattern of local public health organization in the various provinces with special reference to problems of provincial-local relations. This involves consideration of the different types of organization, the size of administrative: unite, administrative structure and relationships, methods of financing and the problem of personnel.
