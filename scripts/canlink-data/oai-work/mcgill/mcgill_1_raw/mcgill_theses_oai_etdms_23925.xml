A comprehensive thermodynamic analysis is performed to identify suitable causticizing metal oxides and process configurations. TiO$ sb2$ is found to be the only metal oxide which can be used for kraft black liquor recovery. Of two possible process configurations, the two-step combustion and reduction process is selected for further experimental study in the present work. The kinetics of the direct causticization reaction between Na$ sb2$CO$ sb3$ and TiO$ sb2$ in a mixture with Na$ sb2$SO$ sb4$ are studied in a tube furnace from 750 to 925$ sp circ$C. It is found that complete conversion of Na$ sb2$CO$ sb3$ can easily be achieved when using a TiO$ sb2$/Na$ sb2$CO$ sb3$ molar ratio of at least 1.25, leading to the formation of 4Na$ sb2$O$ cdot$5TiO$ sb2.$ The formation kinetics of 4Na$ sb2$O$ cdot$5TiO$ sb2$ are well described by a reaction model with product layer control. Insoluble Na$ sb2$ O$ cdot$3TiO$ sb2,$ obtained from hydrolysis of 4Na$ sb2$O$ cdot$5TiO$ sb2,$ can be recycled and reused for CO$ sb2$ release from fresh Na$ sb2$CO$ sb3.$ The influence of TiO$ sb2$ addition on kraft black liquor combustion is investigated using thermoanalytical techniques. The combustion of kraft black liquor is improved despite the large mass fraction of TiO$ sb2.$ The melting point of the combustion product of a mixture of kraft black liquor and TiO$ sb2$ is much higher than that of pure kraft black liquor. Similar to the experiments with the model mixtures, it is also found that complete conversion of Na$ sb2$CO$ sb3$ during kraft black liquor combustion can easily be achieved when the TiO$ sb2$/Na$ sb2$CO$ sb3$, molar ratio is at least 1.25. The presence of TiO$ sb2$ reduces the sulfur loss during combustion. A high causticizing efficiency is obtained with recycled Na$ sb2$O$ cdot$3TiO$ sb2.$ The kinetics of the reduction of sodium sulfate mixed with sodium titanate by both CO and H$ sb2$ are studied in a thermogravimetric system. The H$ sb2$ reduction kinetics are described by the nucleation and growth model up to 60% conversion and by the shrinking core model for higher conversions. The CO reduction kinetics are described by nucleation and growth model up to 95%. Both the H$ sb2$ and CO reduction are accelerated by the initial presence of Na$ sb2$S and are catalyzed by iron oxide. The influence of H$ sb2$ and CO concentrations, H$ sb2$O and CO$ sb2$ concentrations and mass fraction of sodium titanate is also investigated. The combustion product of a mixture of kraft black liquor and TiO$ sb2$ is even faster reduced by H$ sb2$ and CO than the model mixtures.</description><creator>Zou, Xuejun</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Recovery of kraft black liquor including direct causticization</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g732d982z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dv13zv17t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:t435gd78w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:05:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Urease was microencapsulated via interfacial polymerization within polyamide membranes with high yields of protein (83.1%) and specific activity (92.5%) observed. Intracapsular urease concentration was determined spectrophotometrically and represented 6.2 mg/ml of microcapsule volume. The activity distribution analysis of urease microcapsules indicated that 94% of total intracapsular urease was in a soluble form. The balance (6%) was observed to be incorporated into the encapsulating membrane. The specific activities of microcapsule homogenate (131.7 IU/mg) were similar to that of the intact microcapsules (123.2 IU/mg) suggesting minimal mass transfer and diffusional limitations on the overall rate of urea conversion. Urease was co-encapsulated with hemoglobin with high yields of mass (91.5%) and specific activity (84%). The specific activity yield was 10% lover than that observed when pure urease was microencapsulated. Thus, the protective role of hemoglobin against urease interfacial denaturation did not appear to be significant. The pH activity profiles of both free and intracapsular urease were similar with pH optima of 6.0. Thus, effects of charge interactions between ammonia product and the encapsulating nylon membrane were not observed. Similar K$ sb{ rm M}$ values for free (7.6 mM) and intracapsular urease (8.4 mM) suggested that substrate diffusion through the encapsulating membrane did not affect initial rates of catalysis. This was further confirmed by application of the data to a model (Sundaram, 1973) considering the effects of diffusion and mass transfer on the overall reaction rate of intracapsular urease. Under the conditions examined, kinetic rates were slower than the mass transfer rate and thus rate limiting.</description><creator>Monshipouri, Mariam</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Activity distribution and Michaelis-menten parameters of urease microencapsulated within polyamide membranes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/br86b421t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t435gd78w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:08612p411</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:05:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Early identification of mutant embryos prior to the manifestation of a defect facilitates the study of dysmorphogenesis. The In(l)lRk inversion was used as a cytogenetic marker to distinguish embryonic day 9 (D9) splotch (Sp) and splotch-delayed $(Sp sp{d})$ mouse mutants from heterozygous and wild-type littermates, and cellular aspects of abnormal neurulation and NCC migration were examined before inherent neural tube defects (NTDs) and deficiencies in neural crest cell (NCC) derivatives developed. In vitro analysis of NCC emigration from D9 neural tube explants revealed a delay in the release of NCCs from mutant neural tubes compared to controls, suggesting that the primary effect of the mutation was intrinsic to the neuroepithelium. Immunofluorescent localization of the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) antibody in situ demonstrated an increased intensity of antibody fluorescence in mutant tissue compared to controls, and further characterization by immunoblot analysis showed an altered embryonic N-CAM profile in both Sp and $Sp sp{d}$ mutants at D9 of gestation. The importance of N-CAMs in mediating cellular organization and communication has been well documented, supporting the idea that an alteration in this adhesion mechanism could result in the types of defects seen in splotch locus mouse mutants.</description><creator>Moase, Connie E.

That Rubisco remains pyrenoid-localized at photosynthetically-saturating irradiance in the green alga Chlorella pyrenoidosa indicates a catalytic, rather than storage function for pyrenoid-localized Rubisco. This is further supported by the immunolocalization of Rubisco activase to the pyrenoids of two species of green algae. The exclusion of phosphoribulokinase from the pyrenoids of a red and a green alga indicates that pyrenoids do not possess the full complement of Calvin cycle enzymes. Thylakoid lamellae traverse the pyrenoids of many algae. The absence of light-harvesting phycoerythrin and of photosystem (PS) II activity, but not PSI activity, from the intrapyrenoid thylakoids of the red alga Porphyridium cruentum indicates a structural and functional heterogeneity between these lamellae and those located in the chloroplast stroma. In contrast, the intrapyrenoid thylakoids of cryptomonads, algae whose chloroplast is thought to have evolved from red algae, possess both PSI and PSII protein complexes. These results are discussed with reference to Rubisco being mainly pyrenoid-localized in these algae.</description><creator>McKay, R. Michael L.

The sequence analysis of this clone (pKS36) indicated that it has originated from the tandem amplification of pentameric repeats that were derived from satellite II and III canonical consensus sequence 5$ sp prime$ TTCCA 3$ sp prime$. A two-stage decay mechanism, based on the methylation and subsequent deamination of cytosine residues within the pentamers, was proposed to explain the non-random base substitutions that were observed in pKS36, as well as in other sequenced members of the satellite II and III DNA families. In addition, this two-stage decay model correlated with the Tag1 and Hinf1 polymorphisms that were observed between related satellite DNA members. Clone pKS36 also contains a region of 49 bp devoid of satellite sequences that was found, by southern hybridization, to be present in pKS36 closely related (pKS36-like) but absent from more divergent (pKS36-related) cloned satellite II and III DNAs. pKS36-related satellite DNAs represent up to 2% of the genomes of HeLa and MeWo cells, and are organized mostly in tandem arrays of 1.8 Kb EcoR1, Kpn1, and Sau3A DNA fragments. pKS36-like satellite DNAs represent less than 1% of the genome of HeLa cells, and are found mainly organized as 1.65 Kb, 1.95 Kb and 3.6 Kb EcoR1 elements, though their Kpn1 and Sau3A distributions resemble that of pKS36-related satellite DNAs. Cell specific organization of satellite DNAs, that may be the result of chromosomal translocations inherent to cultured cells, was observed in the two human (HeLa and MeWo) cell lines. The analysis, by southern hybridization, of satellite DNAs using field inversion gel electrophoresis revealed the presence, in HeLa cells, of satellite DNA clusters ranging from 150 Kb to 500 Kb in length. Using rodent-human hybrid cell DNAs, the members of the pKS36 satellite II DNA family were found to reside mainly on human chromosomes 7, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 22.</description><creator>Sol, Katia</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Biology, Genetics.</subject><title>Isolation and characterization of human highly repeated satellite II and III DNAs</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g158bj02r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mg74qm804</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pv63g0987</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:05:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>L'evaporation d'eau d'une couche mince (film) de la liqueur noire a ete etudiee en utilisant l'injection par jet; d'air chaud ou de la vapeur. L'epaisseur du film est variee entre 0.8 et 1.2 mm et la temperature du sechage est echelonnee de 180 a 250$ sp circ$C. Autres parametres ont ete etudies; le pourcentage du solide dans la liqueur noire (60-74%) et le debit du fluide du sechage (0.8-1.0 kg/s m$ sp2$). Les caracteristiques du transfert du systeme de sechage ont ete determinees en utilisant la technique de sublimation du naphthalene. Les procedures et les techniques experimentales ont ete verifiees par le sechage d'une pate d'oxyde d'aluminium avec l'air chaud et avec la vapeur. Pour ce systeme la temperature d'inversion obtenue est entre 210 et 230$ sp circ$C. Le taux de sechage de la liqueur noire avec la vapeur etait plus eleve que celui avec l'air pour une temperature d'injection superieure a 200$ sp circ$C. Le sechage par la vapeur presente des caracteristiques differentes du sechage par l'air: (a) une condensation initiale de la vapeur, (b) une courte periode de croissance, (c) un retour graduel; par consequent, le taux de sechage le plus eleve est atteint quand la liqueur renferme le minimum d'eau, (d) une augmentation rapide de la temperature du film pour atteindre la temperature d'ebullition. Les faibles taux de sechage avec l'air peuvent etre expliques par la formation d'une peau flexible sur la surface exposee du film alors qu'avec la vapeur, la peau est absente. Le sechage par la vapeur a temperatures elevees est caracterise par une ebullition a la surface du film alors que le sechage par l'air provoque un enflement extensif. La liqueur noire oxydee presente des taux eleves de sechage par la vapeur et des taux faibles de sechage par l'air. Une analyse numerique du probleme de sechage avec la vapeur est presentee. Une bonne correlation est obtenue avec les resultats experimentaux pour les conditions ou le taux de sechage est limite par la diffusion de l'eau dans le film de la liqueur noire. Des nouvelles techniques sont utilisees pour mesurer la viscosite et la conductivite thermique de la liqueur noir pour des taux eleves de solide.</description><creator>Ramamurthy, Pritham</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Concentration of black liquor to high solids</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cz30pt56w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pv63g0987</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ft848r461</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:05:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Cryptic plasmids ranging from 2.0 to 10C kb in size were isolated from 25 out of 122 Listeria monocytogenes strains, and from 7 out of 11 strains of other Listeria species. Of 2500 clones of a genomic library of L. monocytogenes 81-861 generated in Escherichia coli cells, 5 clones were identified in which $ beta$-hemolytic activity was stably expressed. Testing by intraperitoneal injection showed that these clones were lethal to mice. Restriction mapping of the inserts of the recombinant plasmids showed that, apart from a 650-bp internal Hind III fragment in 2 inserts, there were no other common sites. No homology was demonstrated between the DNAs of the inserts when Southern blots of restriction digests of the 5 plasmids were probed, though homology was demonstrated between the L. monocytogenes listeriolysin O gene and the DNA of one insert. The evidence suggests that at least one additional $ beta$-hemolysin, other than listeriolysin O, exists in this strain of L. monocytogenes, and that it may be a virulence factor. Using a direct colony hybridization procedure on hydrophobic grid-membrane filters (HGMFs), the inserts of the recombinant plasmids were screened, and a DNA probe specific for L. monocytogenes was identified. After labelling with horseradish peroxidase and colour development of the chromogen, a commercial counter (HGMF Interpreter) was able to detect and count the organism electronically. When the efficacy of the chromogen-labelled DNA probe method on HGMFs was compared with the conventional method for three artificially-inoculated foods, there were no significant differences ($ alpha$ = 0.05) shown in the recovery of L. monocytogenes from the foods.</description><creator>Peterkin, Pearl I.</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Listeria monocytogenes -- Molecular genetics.</subject><subject>Listeriosis -- Pathogenesis.</subject><title>Use of molecular genetics to study the detection and pathogenicity of foodborne Listeria monocytogenes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5138jf59s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ft848r461</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n009w309g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:05:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The characteristics and inheritance of maize silk resistance to Fusarium graminearum ear rot were investigated. In an in vitro test, genotypic differences in the degradation of detached silk tissue by F. graminearum were correlated to field evaluations of resistance. Susceptibility to infection decreased with silk age. Total phenolics of silk channel silk tissue increased in response to infection in resistant inbreds but decreased in susceptible inbreds. The flavones iso-orientin, iso-vitexin, maysin, luteolin, and apigenin were identified in the silk. No significant genotype by isolate interaction effects were found when 13 inbred lines were inoculated with three F. graminearum isolates. Simple models of quantitative and qualitative inheritance were not adequate to explain the inheritance of resistance. Disease severity ratings were bimodally distributed in the F$ sb1$, F$ sb2$, and backcross generations. In a complete diallel cross among 12 inbred lines, general and specific combining ability effects were significant for both disease incidence and disease severity. A screening of 12 accessions of exotic maize germplasm with resistance to either Aspergillus flavus or Heliothis zeae, identified several possible new sources of resistance to F. graminearum. Visual evaluations of resistance were correlated to deoxynivalenol levels of the ear.</description><creator>Reid, Lana M.

The growth traits (asymptotic weight (A), rate parameter (k), inflection parameter (m), average lifetime absolute growth rate (AGR), average lifetime absolute maturing rate (AMR) and average lifetime relative growth rate (RGR)) were estimated by fitting the nonlinear equation, W$ sb1$ = A(1 $ pm$ be$ sp{ rm -kt}) sp{ rm M}$, to the observed weight-age data of 3076 individual females. Results from the analyses of growth traits indicated that the H line exceeded the A line in addition genetic effects for individual performance (a$ sp{ rm I}$) for both A and AGR. The H line also exceeded the A line in additive effects for maternal performance (a$ sp{ rm M}$) in trait A. Both dominance (d) and additive x additive (aa) epistatic effects were statistically important in most cases. Individual heterosis (h$ sp{ rm I}$ = d$ sp{ rm I}$ $-$ 0.5aa$ sp{ rm I}$) was positive for traits A and AGR, whereas maternal heterosis (h$ sp{ rm M}$ = d$ sp{ rm M}$ $-$ 0.5aa$ sp{ rm M}$) was negative for A and positive for AMR. Total heterosis (TH = h$ sp{ rm I}$ + h$ sp{ rm M}$) had positive effects on AGR and AMR. For all growth traits, heterosis retained in advanced crossbred generations was statistically irrelevant. The overall conclusion was that crossbreeding systems designed to capitalize on TH would produce faster growing and earlier maturing animals. The analyses of production traits found the additive effect of the H line for individual performance to be a major factor to increase yields of milk, protein and fat. On the other hand, line maternal and cytoplasmic source tended to favour the A line, but none reached statistical significance in any of the traits. Results indicate that two-line specific crosses or synthetic development would be sound breeding strategies for taking advantage of first cross heterosis or of line additive differences, respectively. Estimates of crossbreeding parameters from mixed-model analyses, were found to be more reliable than those from ordinary least squares analyses.

Reduction in the average energy because of using the region ${ cal C}$ as the boundary instead of a hypercube is called the shape gain of ${ cal C}$. The price to be paid for shaping is: (i) an increase in the factor CER$ sb{s}$ (Constellation-Expansion-Ratio), (ii) an increase in the factor PAR (Peak-to-Average-power-Ratio), and (iii) an increase in the addressing complexity. In this thesis, the structure of the region which optimizes the tradeoff between the shape gain and the CER$ sb{s}$ and also between the shape gain and the PAR in a finite dimensional space is found. Analytical expressions are derived for the optimum tradeoff. The optimum shaping region can be mapped to a hypercube truncated within a simplex. This mapping has properties which facilitate the addressing of the signal points. We introduce several addressing schemes with low complexity and good performance. The concept of the unsymmetrical shaping is discussed. This is the selection of the boundary of a constellation which has different values of power along different dimensions. The rate of the constellation is maximized subject to some constraints on its power spectrum. This spectral shaping also involves the selection of an appropriate basis (modulating waveform) for the space. Finally, we discuss the selection a signal constellation of signaling over a partial-response channel. In the continuous approximation, we introduce a method to select the nonempty dimensions. This method is based on minimizing the degradation caused by the channel memory. In the discrete case, shaping and coding depend on each other.

Both isocratic and gradient-elution separations of these compounds were investigated. The enantiomers of twelve racemic dinitrophenyl amino acid derivatives were separated on a $ beta$-cyclodextrin-bonded phase column. The effects of pH, methanol and triethylammonium acetate (TEAA) buffer concentrations on the retention and resolution were investigated. The chiral recognition mechanism was studied by means of UV-visible, circular dichroism and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic methods. A multiple-interaction type of chiral stationary phase was developed by bonding $ beta$-cyclodextrin to silica gel and modifying the cyclodextrin cavity by flexibly capping its primary hydroxyl or small side. These modified $ beta$ cyclodextrin stationary phases contain a hydrophobic cavity, capable of inclusion complexation; aromatic groups, capable of $ pi$-$ pi$ interaction; and polar hydrogen-bonding sites, capable of forming hydrogen-bonding with the polar functional groups of the solutes. These stationary phases exhibit a high stereoselectivity toward a wide variety of chiral compounds. The preparation and properties of these modified $ beta$-cyclodextrin stationary phases are described. The enantiomeric separation of amino acids and their derivatives, of carboxylic acids, of phenothiazine drugs, and of other chiral compounds are reported. The effects of mobile phase composition on the retention and resolution are discussed.</description><creator>Li, Song, 1957-</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Chemistry, Pharmaceutical.</subject><title>Liquid chromatographic separation of enantiomers and structurally-related compounds on b-cyclodextrin stationary phases</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8w32r6515.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q524jp48w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hh63sw64g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:06:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Organometallic reactions, including allylation, alkylation, aldol and Reformatsky type reactions of carbonyl compounds in aqueous media mediated by Sn, Zn, Mn, and In were studied.

A series of experiments first established that disadvantaged group members faced with open access to an advantaged group (meritocracy) choose either inaction or attempts at individual upward mobility. Conversely, those faced with an advantaged group that is closed (complete discrimination) engage primarily in collective nonnormative action. However, when faced with severe, but not total, discriminatory restrictions (tokenism), disadvantaged group members consistently prefer individual nonnormative action. This preference is unaffected by increases in ingroup identification, increased prior ingroup interaction, and removal of direct self-interest. Some support was found for the role of situational ambiguity in maintaining the preference for individual action in conditions of tokenism. In two final experiments the behavioral responses of "successful tokens" were investigated. These experiments show that successful tokens shift their allegiance from the disadvantaged group to the advantaged group and choose action in support of this new high-status ingroup at the expense of the disadvantaged group.</description><creator>Wright, Stephen C.</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Group identity.</subject><subject>Discrimination.</subject><title>Responding to intergroup discrimination : an analysis of tokenism</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9306t005v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9306t004k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:t435gd795</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:06:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The aim of the thesis is to analyze the relationship between British guerrilla warfare and espionage operations as well as their impact upon the Greek resistance.

It was found that the transport of macromolecules, including low density lipoproteins, from flowing blood to a semi-permeable vessel wall is greatly enhanced in regions of disturbed flow with a local maximum locating around the reattachment (stagnation) point. The surface concentration of macromolecules increases with increasing the filtration velocity and decreasing the flow rate. The disturbed flows also facilitated the transport of low molecular weight substances such as biochemicals but not macromolecules from arterial walls to flowing blood. These results strongly suggest that disturbed flows with slow recirculation flow provide favorable conditions for the genesis and development of atherosclerotic lesions by affecting local mass transport phenomena at the blood-vessel wall boundary.</description><creator>Deng, Xiaoyan</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Biophysics, Medical.</subject><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</subject><title>The effects of disturbed flows on mass transfer to and from an arterial wall /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gq67jr96n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9s161699w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rr171z009</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:06:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The gluing and tensor product constructions of lattices are reviewed.

The mechanisms of copper activity linked to neovascular and neoplastic growth are largely unknown. Copper ion was shown to be a cofactor for angiogenesis. We tested the effect of copper depletion achieved by a low copper diet and a copper chelator D-penicillamine, on the intracerebral growth of two experimental brain tumors. We developed in in vivo brain tumor model using the VX2 carcinoma. Implantation of 5 $ times$ 10$ sp5$ VX2 carcinoma cells into the parietal lobe of normocupremic rabbits consistently yielded large hemorrhagic, necrotic, vascularized tumors. The cortical surface revealed numerous, hypertrophied, tortuous new vessels with feeding arteries and draining veins similar to the angioarchitecture of malignant human brain tumors. We report here that copper depletion prevents tumor neovascularization and restricts tumor growth of the VX2 carcinoma in the rabbit brain. Low copper diet and penicillamine are both necessary to achieve angiogenic inhibition. We also tested the effect of copper depletion on the 9L gliosarcoma. We observed that invasive growth of the tumor was blocked in rats depleted of copper. Electron microscopy revealed the absence of cytoplasmic extensions, including pseudopodia, by contrast, in normocupremic controls, cytoplasmic extensions, typical of mobile cells, invaded the surrounding neuropil. Our findings link the activity of copper in vascular and neoplastic growth. We found an increase in the peritumoral brain water content in the copper depleted animals and that copper depletion by itself in nontumor implanted animal has no effect on brain water content. Because of the ability to pharmacologically suppress capillary growth induced by the VX2 carcinoma, we could test the relative contribution of breakdown of the blood-brain barrier compared with that of angiogenesis in the appearance of contrast enhancement in computed tomographic examinations. We conclude from our data that tumor neovascularization, in our brain tumor model, is the key determinant for the appearance of contrast enhancement. The same protocol used in the brain failed to prevent tumor neovascularization and growth of the VX2 carcinoma in the muscle of the rabbit thigh indicating the crucial role played by the milieu (muscle versus brain) for the growth of malignant tumor. In the same manner, lung metastases were not prevented.</description><creator>Zagzag, David.</creator><date>1988</date><subject>Brain Neoplasms.</subject><subject>Angiogenesis Inducing Agents.</subject><subject>Copper -- deficiency.</subject><title>The effects of copper depletion on intracerebral angiogenesis and growth of experimental brain tumors /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8k71nh868.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qr46r178c</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n009w312s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:06:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The mechanism of benzimidazole (BZ) anthelmintic resistance in Haemonchus contortus was investigated. The total binding (TB), low-affinity binding (LAB) and high-affinity (specific) binding (HAB) of ($ sp3$H) BZs (mebendazole (MBZ), oxibendazole (OBZ), albendazole (ABZ) and oxfendazole (OFZ)) in supernatants derived from BZ-susceptible (S) and BZ-resistant (R) strains were examined and compared. The TB of all ($ sp3$H) BZs was reduced for the R strain. The TB of OBZ, MBZ and ABZ was separated into LAB and HAB. However, OFZ bound with low-affinity. The binding affinity, K$ sb{ rm a},$ and maximum binding, B$ sb{ rm max},$ for the HAB of OBZ and MBZ were calculated using computer programs. Compared with the S strain, the B$ sb{ rm max}$ of the R strain was reduced but the K$ sb{ rm a}$ was not affected. LAB to parasite preparations devoid of tubulin was observed but HAB occurred to preparations containing tubulin only. The HAB per mg protein decreased from egg through larva to adult stage. It was shown by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis that the tubulin content per mg protein decreased from egg, through larva to adult worm. The ability of various BZs--OBZ, MBZ, ABZ, OFZ, fenbendazole (FBZ), albendazole sulphoxide (ABZSO), albendazole sulphone (ABZSO$ sb2),$ and thiabendazole (TBZ)--to bind tubulin was compared by displacement analysis and their IC$ sb{50}$ ( (BZ) required to inhibit 50% of the ($ sp3$H) BZ binding) and K$ sb{ rm a}$ values were determined. The IC$ sb{50}$ and K$ sb{ rm a}$ values approximately correlated with the known anthelmintic potency (recommended therapeutic doses) of the BZs except for OFZ and ABZSO.

Our first attempt at obtaining such strains was made by using an in vitro approach in which a lymphoid cell line, chronically infected with HIV-1, was exposed to various drug concentrations. Although this system has never generated such mutants, we found that the progeny virus population, present in the culture fluids of these chronically infected drug-treated cells lost infectivity. These results suggest a potential post-integrational role for zidovudine, possibly acting at the level of viral assembly or budding. However, we were successful in isolating zidovudine-resistant HIV-1 strains from the blood of patients undergoing AZT treatment. Our work shows that a minimum of 27 weeks of treatment is necessary for the appearance of the resistant phenotype and that the majority (75%) of patients treated with AZT for more than one year will generate such resistant strains. No correlation between the clinical status of the patients and the occurrence of resistant variants can be drawn from our work. However, in vitro experiments have shown that the resistant isolates are more cytopathic, although less infectious, than the sensitive strains. Reverse transcriptase enzymes from both AZT-resistant and -sensitive strains were virtually identical when their respective enzymatic activities or their affinity for the substrate or the inhibitor were compared. Finally, some zidovudine-resistant isolates demonstrate cross-resistance to other nucleoside analogs with potential clinical applications.</description><creator>Rooke, Ronald</creator><date>1991</date><subject>HIV-1.</subject><subject>Zidovudine.</subject><title>Studies on mechanism of action of AZT and HIV-1 drug resistance</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rf55z866f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3j333309j</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k35695320</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:06:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The promoter region of the rat gene encoding the enzyme carbamyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS) has been cloned and characterized. The start of transcription was positioned to 138-140 nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation codon. From transient transfection analyses, the functional promoter region of the CPS gene extends 5$ sp prime$ to about 525 nucleotides of the start site of transcription. This promoter region contains six footprinted regions when analyzed in liver nuclear extracts. All sites can be recognized by endogenous C/EBP from liver nuclear extracts while the endogenous DBP binds to all sites except site II. Either C/EBP or DBP can trans-activate the CPS promoter in Hep G2 cells. Sites I, III and IV seem to be significantly protected only in the presence of liver nuclear extracts as opposed to brain, kidney or spleen extracts.

Efficiency strategies involve minor changes to existing activities, resulting in more efficient resource use. Substitution strategies involve replacing one product, technique or activity with another. Redesign strategies require solutions and institutional activities that mimic ecological processes.

The Eu$ sp{3+}$ ions were found to exhibit spectra which could be categorized into three types of emitting centres. These emitting centres are related to the crystallographic sites available for Eu$ sp{3+}$ in $ beta sp{ prime prime}$-alumina, namely the mid-Oxygen and Beevers-Ross sites. The fluorescent lifetimes were measured and were found to be consistent with the site assignments, particularly in the variations possible in the Eu$ sp{3+}$ coordination in mid-Oxygen sites. Analysis of the emission intensities reveals that the calculated site populations are in agreement with previously published X-ray results. Crystal-field analysis of the spectra indicates that the different types of centres are subject to different crystal-field strengths and that effects such as J-mixing play an important role in the observed spectra. Point-charge lattice sum calculations on an idealized structure of the $ beta sp{ prime prime}$-alumina crystal are in qualitative agreement with the crystal-field analysis and also provide a model for the observed inhomogeneous linewidths based on the number of residual sodium atoms in the unit cell. In addition, several anomalous features of the Eu$ sp{3+}$ spectra are described and discussed in terms of the structure of the crystal and its influence on the Eu$ sp{3+}$ ion's energy levels.</description><creator>Brown, Andrew P.

This is accomplished by designing and investigating joint delay estimation and adaptive filtering algorithms. First, joint maximum likelihood estimator is derived for input Gaussian signals. It is used to define a readily implementable joint estimator, composed of an adaptive delay element and an adaptive filter. Next, two estimation criteria are investigated with that structure. The minimum mean squared error criterion is used with a joint steepest-descent adaptive algorithm and with a joint least-mean-square adaptive algorithm. The general convergence conditions of the joint steepest-descent algorithm are derived. The joint LMS algorithm is analysed in terms of joint convergence in the mean and in the mean square. Finally, a joint recursive least squares adaptive algorithm is investigated in conjunction with the exponentially weighted least squares criterion. Experimental results are obtained for these different adaptive algorithms, in order to verify the analyses. The results show that the joint algorithms improve the performance of the conventional adaptive filtering techniques.</description><creator>Boudreau, Daniel</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Joint time delay estimation and adaptive filtering techniques</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j3860782b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v692t715p</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1c18dg548</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:06:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Two prospective investigations of periodicity of sexual behavior, well-being and testosterone (T) levels in women using and not using oral contraceptives (OCs) found no relationship between daily ratings of sexual desire and well-being across one pill and menstrual cycle. T, but not estradiol or progesterone, was positively correlated with sexual desire and sexual enjoyment in OC-users when T levels were below normal menstrual values. Other evidence suggested on association between post-ovulatory decreases in T and sexual desire in women. A bias to attend to sexual stimuli on a dichotic listening task was associated with sexual arousability in men. Moreover, task performance indicated T may enhance attention to relevant stimuli. While social variables are clearly important determinants of sexual behavior, these findings suggest a relationship between T and cognitive aspects of sexual behavior in young, healthy individuals.</description><creator>Alexander, Gerianne M.</creator><date>1990</date><subject>Testosterone.</subject><subject>Sexology -- Research.</subject><subject>Sex</subject><subject>Oral contraceptives.</subject><title>Testosterone and cognitive aspects of sexual behavior in women and men</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8s45q9772.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1c18dg548</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3197xm615</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T03:06:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><creator>Ng, Ang-Ser.</creator><date>1967</date><subject>Dermatophytes</subject><title>The isolations and structures of vioxanthin and viopurpurin and the partial structure of vioviriden.</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9w032384h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3197xm615</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):23950</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
