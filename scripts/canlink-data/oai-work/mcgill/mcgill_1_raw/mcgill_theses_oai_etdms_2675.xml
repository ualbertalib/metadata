In chapter 1,1 identify and describe the social modes exhibited by adult blue tangs and include the first description of adult territoriality in this species. Adults in the population were either territorial or nonterritorial. Non-territorial fish formed schools and wandered, while territorial fish never schooled but sometimes wandered from their territory. In chapter 2,1 explore potential determinants of the variation in the social organization in an attempt to explain the coexistence of the territorial and non-territorial modes. I examine the distribution of territorial, schooling and wandering tangs in relation to life history stage, habitat, time of day, competitor density, food abundance and population density. Life history stage, density of competitor damselfishes and conspecific population density appear to be key determinants of this social organization.</description><creator>Morgan, Ingrid</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Surgeonfishes -- Ecology -- Caribbean Sea.</subject><subject>Surgeonfishes -- Behavior -- Caribbean Sea.</subject><title>The behaviour and ecology of social organization in a Caribbean surgeonfish</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ft848s66q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/r781wj221</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2z10ws57g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:24:55Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Using a vertical Bridgman method, ingots of the chalcopyrite semiconductor CuInSe2 were prepared containing monocrystals of the compound with dimensions of several millimetres. The ingots were grown from both stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric proportions of the starting elements copper, indium and selenium. Material prepared with excess selenium (CuInSe2 2) showed increased p-type conductivity in the last zone to freeze of the ingot, while material grown with a deficiency (CuInSei 8) of this element showed n-type behaviour , with extra binary phases, such as InSe, in the last zone to freeze. Ingots with excess copper (CuxInSe2), where x was 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3, showed precipitated copper phase regions in the last zone to freeze and thin copper phase filaments emerging from the ingot end face . The electrical resistivity immediately adjacent to the copper precipitate regions was found to be higher than elsewhere. Photovoltaic cells were fabricated from wafers cut from the p-type Bridgman-grown ingots with a layer structure Au-CuInSe2-CdS-ZnO-In. The gold was evaporated on the back of the wafer, the CdS was deposited by a chemical bath method, the ZnO by rf sputtering and the indium contact stripes on the ZnO were deposited by evaporation. Measurements of dark and illuminated current-voltage characteristics, photoresponse and capacitance-voltage characteristics were made on the fabricated cells. One of these devices indicated a conversion efficiency, without an antireflection coating, of 12.5 % under sunlight on a cell area of 12.6 mm2, which is better than on any previous monocrystalline cell. Among the cells, it was found that better photovoltaic performance correlated with a higher hole concentration, as estimated from Mott-Schottky plots.</description><creator>Du, Hui</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</subject><title>Study of photovoltaic cells fabricated with monocrystalline bridgman-grown culnSe2</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9p290c72n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2z10ws57g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4t64gq427</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:24:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In the central highlands of Iceland, the implementation of new measures to delimit property rights spatially and to establish new regional management plans have caused debates over the use of natural resources with regard to their exploitation, protection and ownership. This study has tried to highlight how to resolve the debate over the use of natural resources and over the definition of land ownership in Iceland with respect to traditional user-rights and ownership practised by local communities. The answer to these questions are particularly important for marginal local communities that use the commons as pasture for sheep grazing because they will directly be affected by hydropower plants and ecotourism projected by the regional development plans. Collecting data through personal interviews and analyzing legal documents with regard to ownership rights and regional planning have been the principal approaches. Firstly, the thesis discusses the theoretical context of conflict resolution within the future developmental plans for Iceland's central highlands. Secondly, the historical and traditional aspects of locally based agricultural production and the social System practiced in the commons are explored. Thirdly, the new rules for the application of the management of resources, ownership rights as well as for the management of national hydropower energy projects are analyzed. In this case, the tools for territorial conflict resolution and the process of territorial planning are discussed in their relation to the construction of hydropower plants in the commons of the Fljótsdalur valley, located between the highlands and the fjords of the eastern region. Finally, the case of Fljótsdalur is presented by focussing on the conflicting interactions between interests in and values given to either the traditional ownership rights or the regional plans for developing tourism and hydroelectric power. The results indicate tensions over how natural resources of the central highlands should be used. There is also a noticeable difference among the various lobby groups with respect to the level of comprehension of what is the area's significance for the country and its resource development. The results obtained show that monetary compensation or clarification of ownership rights is not sufficient for territorial conflict resolution. More important, rather, is the coordination of regional planning procedures, in a way which enhances cooperation among local institutions, and recognizes the interests and values that local community's associate with their environment.</description><creator>Roy, Christine</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Regional planning -- Citizen participation -- Iceland</subject><subject>Commons -- Iceland.</subject><subject>Natural resources -- Iceland.</subject><title>Débat sur les réclamations des ressources naturelles et des terres communales dans les montagnes centrales de l'Islande</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1544br670.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4t64gq427</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hh63sz10k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:24:56Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In North America, the acceleration of the eutrophication of surface waters due to nutrient pollution is still present. Soil studies have not entirely succeeded in linking nutrient and sediment losses to field hydrology because relationships between discharge and dissolved ions/sediments are complicated by a hysteresis effect which has been only described qualitatively. The objective of this thesis was to better understand the effects of hydrology on N, P, and sediment transfer from agricultural and forest soils to surface waters. This was done by developing a technique, called the H index, to quantify the hysteretic behaviour of ion and sediment transport in stream/overland water. The chemical and sediment  concentrations in a stream of a forested watershed in the Sierra Nevada during snowmelt and in overland runoff of two agricultural fields during rain events in the Montreal area were examined. In the stream of the forested watershed, H indices for suspended sediment increased (looser hysteresis loop) with the availability of sediments and the lag between peaks in suspended sediment concentrations and discharge. In agricultural fields, nutrient concentrations increased with time during each event with presence of counterclockwise and clockwise hysteresis. The hysteretic behaviour of suspended sediments was not significantly related with either prior soil moisture content or rainfall characteristics. In order to simultaneously monitor P and N in the stream and soils of the forested watershed, a laboratory study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of various mixedbed exchange resins in absorbing dissolved organic and inorganic N and P. Results showed that mixed-bed resin was adequate for characterizing P on a short-time scale but longer exposure periods were required for N. Results from the resin exchange reveal the possibility that the spring time pulse of NOs'-N in stream water was due to the melting of the snowpack.</description><creator>Langlois, Jacques</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Nutrient pollution of water -- Tahoe, Lake, Watershed (Calif. and Nev.).</subject><subject>Sediment transport -- Tahoe, Lake, Watershed (Calif. and Nev.).</subject><subject>Nutrient pollution of water -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal Region.</subject><subject>Agricultural pollution -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal Region.</subject><subject>Forest soils -- Tahoe, Lake, Watershed (Calif. and Nev.).</subject><subject>Sediment transport -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal Region.</subject><title>Nutrient and sediment movements from soil to surface water in a forested watershed and two agricultural fields</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2514nn64t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hh63sz10k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2514nn653</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:24:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In our current education system learning is organized as a series of sequential steps and the curriculum is constituted by a set of independent objects.

The three characteristics of modernity: time-space separation, disembedding of social systems, and reflexivity have all been intensified in the last twenty years. Globalization is, on one hand, pulling different cultures together to form a global world; on the other hand, diversifying and fragmenting the social contexts of human activities. The modern individual struggles to adapt to the different social milieux he is involved in and finds it difficult to form a coherent identity. Modern social systems provide more security; it also creates risks of high-consequence. Human life is threatened with a sense of meaninglessness. Giddens suggests, in order to liberate themselves, human individuals should take more responsibility to make decisions on their own lifestyles and on social issues. Education should aim to develop the individual's ability to make rational choices.</description><creator>Zhao, Xu</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Education, Philosophy of</subject><title>The self in a globalizing world : a study of globalization and its impact on identity</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hd76s235c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hf364</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Integrated Studies in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:d791sj41g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:24:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The declaration of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932 marked the end of a fbirty-year process to unify the peninsula. Under the authority of Ibn Saud, the conquest movement which began in 1902 came to control most of current Saudi Arabia by 1932. Throughout this period, Ibn Saud used the legitimacy he gained from the historical association of his family with the Wahhabi movement to help solidify his political authority. However, in order to properly understand how this occurred, Ibn Saud's conquest movement and the effects of the Wahhabi ideology more generally need to be contextualized in terms of tribal political norms and practices. Thus, rather than providing a historical narrative for the period under review, the focus here will be on the construction of Ibn Saud's political authority, using two conceptual tools. First, what role was played by his leadership over, and embodiment of, the Wahhabi movement in the creation of his political authority, and second, how did the tribal political context facilitate such a process.</description><creator>Beatty, Adam</creator><date>2003</date><subject>History, Middle Eastern</subject><title>The Wahhabi tribe : an analysis authority in the unification of the arabian peninsula, 1902-1932</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q811km91m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d791sj41g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Islamic Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rb68xd921</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:00Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis investigates different spaces in the lives of a group of adults living with long-term mental illness in Montreal. In particular, it is interested in exploring the role and functions of an alternative mental health resource that they all attend, using their narratives as the basis of meaning construction. My intention is to illuminate the complex interplay of identity, social participation, and physical place itself in the 'space' of experience for individuals. The way that a description of one of these elements is often in relationship with the other two, and that these connections can be useful in understanding descriptions of experiences by individuals, which, in David Morris' terms occur in a, "realm beyond language" (1997:p29). Finally, the concept of the 'border' is proposed as a tool to reexamine culture, identity and space, and one that is particularly useful in the context of self-help groups.</description><creator>Sharples, Rosemary</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Mentally ill -- Social conditions -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</subject><subject>Community mental health services -- Social aspects -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</subject><title>Negotiating 'normal' : space, illness and identity in an alternative mental health resource in Montreal</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sb397b42t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rb68xd921</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anthropology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:t148fk251</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:01Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The influence of energy restriction on the transmission dynamics of a direct life cycle nematode, Heligmosomoides polygyrus, within free-running arena Systems has to date remained unexplored. Indoor populations of CD-1 outbred mice were established for 12 weeks in arenas and fed either energy-suffi ci ent (ES) or energy-restricted (ER-20% réduction in metabolizable energy) diets. Infection was introduced to ail arenas following 3 weeks of diet treatment. Contrary to previous findings, the mice fed the ER diets compensated for the deficiency by increasing food consumption and thus, while early in the experiment energy restriction was evident, dietary effects were no longer observed after 6 weeks. Worm burdens, measured at 4 time points over the course of the experiment, were higher in mice fed the ES diets. Although mice fed the ER diets had greater contact with infected areas, the mice fed the ES diets increased the duration of behaviours that heighten ingestion of the parasite - self and allogrooming. Dietary effects on behaviour were observed only after infection was introduced and were more pronounced in the durations of individual bouts rather than in overall durations or time budgets. Nesting bouts were prolonged in mice in the ER arenas perhaps as a means of thermoregulation to counteract the combined effects of infection and energy restriction. The duration of exploratory bouts was also higher in the ER mice possibly due to an inability to receive or process information in their environment. Social interactions, predominantly involving sniffing, increased after infection was introduced, supporting the rôle of odour in communicating infection status in same-sex conspecifics. Together these results provide a more comprehensive ethogram of mice in a semi-natural setting and highlight those behaviours where adaptive plasticity allows response to dietary and infection stresses.</description><creator>Dare, Oluwayemisi Katherine</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Mice -- Parasites.</subject><subject>Helminthiasis -- Nutritional aspects.</subject><subject>Heligmosomatidae.</subject><subject>Mice -- Feeding and feeds.</subject><title>The influence of energy-restriction on accumulation of Heligmosomoides polygyrus (Nematoda) in outbred CD-1 mice in free-running arenas</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mg74qp29k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t148fk251</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Parasitology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cj82k940b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:02Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We review several properties of string theory and introduce the Brandenberger-Vafa mechanism.

Effectiveness of treatment was assessed by characterization of the films produced. When O2 gas incoming to the chamber was 0.1%, the optimum conditions for deposition of thin film ZnO were two hours of line flushing prior to sputtering, deposition duration of eight hours, applied voltage of 32 V ac and Ar-02 gas inflow rate of 131.5 mm/min. Sputtered from Zn with dopant unincorporated, sheet resistance of the best ZnO film obtained was 3.09 x 10 Q/D. Sputtering with dopant incorporated within the target, sheet resistance of the best ZnO film obtained was 2.57 x 102 Q/D. O2 gas admission of 1% produced, over the 400-1600 nm wavelength range studied, the highest optical transmission, in excess on the average of 80% through the films. Films that transmitted the most light, tended to have the largest sheet resistances, 10 Q/D or above. For constant O2 admission concentration, it was found that optical transmission tended to increase as ac applied voltage was lowered during deposition. During Hall effect measurement, carrier concentration of the films was found to increase with increase of the dopant concentration, with mean carrier concentration for the most highly doped ZnO film sample being 2.22 x 10 cm" . Carrier mobility obtained with a combination of film treatments was approximately nine times greater than by doping alone, suggesting that carrier mobility can be altered by combining treatments. After a combination of treatments, highest sample mean carrier mobility was 21.79 cm2V" V1. After doping alone, with other conditions not optimized, the most highly doped sample had mean carrier mobility of 2.41 cm V" s" . A decrease in sheet resistance of the order of magnitude of 104 Q/D was obtained after 320 minutes of sample annealing at 200° C. Following heat treatment, the highest carrier concentration obtained was 7.70 x 10 cm" . The highest mean mobility was 5.89 c m W .</description><creator>Maniate, Janet</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</subject><title>Fabrication and characterization of DC magnetron sputtered ZnO films</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n870zs76v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8049g724c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:794080336</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A new method of drug discovery, the pseudo-dynamic combinatorial library, is described. The technique involves expanding on the dynamic combinatorial library method, where a reversible synthetic reaction is carried out in the presence of a target. In the pseudo-dynamic combinatorial library, this reversible reaction is separated into two irreversible steps. The independent control of the two steps leads to superior selectivity in the screening process. A model system based on peptidic inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase was developed and studied. The synthesis of a series of new carbonic anhydrase inhibitors is described. Amino acids with sulfonamide and sulfamide functional groups, which are known to bind to carbonic anhydrase, were prepared. The synthesis of a series of active esters attached to solid support are described. The tetrafluorophenyl esters are shown to be ideal for amide bond formation in aqueous media. The properties of this class of active esters were investigated. Initial studies on a static library screening method are reported.

It has been demonstrated that clk-2 affects telomere length also in worms and human cells. By now the exact biochemical function of CLK-2 is unknown. In order to shed light onto the function of the gene clk-2, a two-hybrid screen was carried out to identify the interactors of the protein CLK-2. A potential interactor of CLK-2, Y105C5B.19, was identified in the screen. Y105C5B.19 is a novel gene and does not have homologues in other species. Y105C5B.19 contains an MSP (major sperm protein) domain, therefore it is possible that it could be involved in the processes that regulate oocyte maturation, gonadal sheath contractions, or sperm mobility. Interestingly, given that clk-2 is required for subsequent embryogenesis at some point during a narrow time between the end of oocyte maturation and the 2-cell stage, it is tempting to speculate that the interaction between CLK-2 and Y105C5B.19 might be functionally relevant. The lethality of clk-2(qm37) mutants might result from delayed consequences of defects in ovulation and/or fertilization, and perhaps such defects could result from the disruption of the interaction between CLK-2 and Y105C5B.19. The amino acid substitution C772Y resulting from the clk-2(qm37) mutation was found to disrupt the interaction between CLK-2 and Y105C5B.19 in a two-hybrid assay, lending support to the idea that the interaction between CLK-2 and Y105C5B.19 takes place in vivo.</description><creator>Wang, Ying</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Caenorhabditis elegans -- Genetics.</subject><subject>Caenorhabditis elegans -- Longevity.</subject><title>Identification of a protein that interacts with Caenorhadbitis elegans CLK-2 in a yeast two-hybrid assay</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k643b3294.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5m60qv102</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:v692t851r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A new sampling method that decouples spatial and environmental correlations was developed and applied to a temperate forest understory. Data were used to contrast niche theory with neutral theory, and only showed support for niche theory. A spatial and environmental partitioning analysis indicated that the effects of dispersal are primarily important within the spatial extent of environments suitable for a given species. The same sampling data were used to test correlates of non-native species invasion at a species level and as a group. The distributions of non-native plant species are also better explained by the niche model; however, non-native species do not appear to negatively impact native species, nor to be negatively impacted by native species. Together, these results suggest that the forest understory is strongly niche-structured, but likely not saturated. Diversity in this forest appears to be primarily determined by regional processes, and only secondarily by local species interactions.</description><creator>Gilbert, Benjamin</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Endemic plants -- Geographical distribution. -- Québec (Province) -- Mont-Saint-Hilaire.</subject><subject>Niche (Ecology) -- Québec (Province) -- Mont-Saint-Hilaire.</subject><subject>Invasive plants -- Geographical distribution. -- Québec (Province) -- Mont-Saint-Hilaire</subject><title>Determinants of native and non-native plant distributions in a temperate forest understory</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d791sj42r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v692t851r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:f1881p24b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:06Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A system is implemented that optimizes two-dimensional magnetostatic devices.

As a resuit, of the complexity of those fields, the theoretical treatment of turbulence is a long-standing challenge of fluid mechanics. An empirical study of stochastic fluctuations in atmospheric aerosol concentration using state of the art lidar data is the subject of this thesis. The statistics of the fluctuations in the scalar field are closely related to those of the turbulent Avind field. Initially, a detailed review of the treatments of such turbulent atmospheric fields that is commonly found in the littérature is given. The main strands of research relevant to a statistical understanding of atmospheric dynamics are (1) isotropic hydrodynamic turbulence in 2D and 3D (with extensions), (2) buoyancy driven flows (3) gravity wave theories, (4) closures, (5) direct numerical simulations. It is argued that all current approaches treat the anisotropy of the dynamics and the characteristic intermittency inappropriately. Already existing - albeit limited - empirical evidence is then used to motivate the relevance of Generalized Scale Invariance and the Unified Scaling Model (e.g. [Schertzer and Lovejoy, 1983, 1984, 1985]) Avhich models turbulent atmospheric fields as anisotropic multifractal cascade processes. This model implies the anisotropic multiscaling of the fields over the entire range of spatial scales and that variability increases algebraically downscale leading to a highly intermittent field.</description><creator>Lilley, Marc</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Physics, Fluid and Plasma</subject><title>Study of anisotropic scaling and intermittency of aerosols using airborne lidar</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7d278w42h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v405sc58g</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gt54kq29f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:08Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Metal-contamination of lakes simplifies food webs and reduces the efficiency of energy transfer to top trophic organisms, such as yellow perch (Perca flavescens). Benthic invertebrate community composition and yellow perch diet, growth and activity levels from lakes along a metal-contamination gradient were used to assess the importance of a naturally diverse prey base for maintaining energy transfer to growing fish, and how this is disrupted by metal-contamination. As perch grow larger, they shift their diet to larger prey; otherwise, the activity costs of foraging for many, small prey, instead of a few large prey, become too high and the fish stop growing. Metal contaminated lakes have less diverse zoobenthic communities, particularly the lack of large bodied invertebrate taxa, forcing perch to rely on smaller benthic prey. Perch from metal-contaminated lakes display slow growth and poor condition during benthivory. Estimates of fish activity, using the activity of the glycolytic enzyme Lactate dehydrogenase in perch white muscle tissue as a proxy, suggest that diet shifts to larger prey lower activity costs and may explain how diet shifts maintain growth efficiency as perch grow larger. Perch from metal-contaminated lakes cannot benefit from the energetic advantages of switching to larger prey and thus exhibit poor growth.</description><creator>Iles, Alison</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Food chains (Ecology) -- Ontario -- Greater Sudbury Region.</subject><subject>Yellow perch -- Effect of heavy metals on -- Ontario -- Greater Sudbury Region.</subject><subject>Yellow perch -- Effect of water pollution on -- Ontario -- Greater Sudbury Region.</subject><title>Indirect effects of metal-contamination on energetics of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) in Sudbury area lakes, resulting from food web simplification</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zk51vj95z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gt54kq29f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2227ms06w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:08Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A quantification of local energy dispersion is employed to distinguish cases of downstream baroclinic development, as described by Orlanski and Sheldon, from among 41 cold-season cyclones that intensified strongly over the eastern North Pacific Ocean. Complete summaries of the eddy energy budget are calculated for each event, and about half are found to be in general accord with the proposed evolution. Almost all of this subset appear to have been influenced by a dispersion of energy from separate cyclones developing over the western North Pacific a day or two earlier. The primary source for eddy energy dispersion downstream and subsequent generation near the eastern cases is a baroclinic conversion associated with ascent in the warm sector of the upstream cyclones. The importance of downstream baroclinic development is confirmed for one eastern North Pacific cyclone in two complementary ways. First, the original eddy energy diagnosis is compared to one based on wave activity. In terms of local group velocity, only minor differences are found during much of the initial evolution. It is only once the tropopause undulations lose their wave-like appearance that the group velocity calculated using eddy energy becomes faster than that depicted by wave activity. Second, by employing numerical simulations, the importance of downstream baroclinic development to the intensification of this cyclone is quantified. Various initial conditions are produced using potential vorticity inversion. Simulations in which an upstream trough/ridge couplet are removed from the initial conditions result in both the absence of a downstream baroclinic development and a weakening of the downstream surface cyclone. The remainder of this study investigates the relationship between cold-season cyclones and sea surface temperature anomalies for small groups of strong cyclones occurring in the western North Pacific region. Previous studies have emphasized the importance of the western ocean boundary currents and their strong sea surface temperature gradients to rapid cyclone development. Physical mechanisms governing this relationship have been studied extensively elsewhere. Here, proxy evidence of systematic changes in the role of surface heat and moisture fluxes during the cold season is presented. Cyclones of similar intensification rates are grouped according to their occurrence either during midwinter or during the early and late cold season. Systematic differences in sea surface temperature anomalies beneath these two groups are interpreted as a proxy for corresponding differences in preconditioning by the upperoceanic mixed layer. Submonthly sea level pressure variations for the same North Pacific cyclones appear to support an interpretation in terms of an upward oceanic influence. It is suggested that the role of preconditioning heat fluxes in cyclones varies because of large-scale seasonal changes in baroclinicity and in the availabilitv of water vapour already in the atmosphere. Similar differences are obtained using a group of strong western North Atlantic cyclones.</description><creator>Danielson, Richard E.</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Earth Sciences, Physical Oceanography</subject><title>Environmental influences on cold-season cyclones over the North Pacific Ocean</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f4752j97w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2227ms06w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9w032518b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This work is a historical re-evaluation of the 1988 Outremont dispute that began as a small municipal affair involving two Hasidic congregations, Congregation Amour Pour Israel and Congregation Munchos Elozar-Munkatz. Both groups failed in their attempts to change a zoning bylaw that would allow the former to construct a synagogue at 1035 Saint-Viateur and the latter to retain its synagogue at 1030 Saint-Viateur. By the time it ended, the Canadian Jewish Congress and the Human Rights League of B'nai Brith had become involved in mediating the dispute and responding to the anti-Hasidic stance expressed by some francophone residents of Outremont and a number of journalists. Although several scholars have examined this incident, it has been secondary to other issues. Moreover, a comprehensive review of the scholarly literature written on the controversy shows that scholars' focus on the media fallout necessarily omits key elements of the incident: the historical narrative of the municipal vote, the extent of Jewish organizational involvement, the larger press reaction to the anti-Hasidic stance, and the positions taken by the Hasidim and the municipal officials themselves. This historical approach provides inclusion and analysis of these issues. Finally, a review of the literature written on Hasidim in Canada places this re-evaluation in its proper scholarly context.</description><creator>Herman, Dana</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Outremont (Québec) -- Ethnic relations</subject><subject>Jews -- Québec (Province) -- Outremont.</subject><subject>Hasidim -- Québec (Province) -- Outremont.</subject><title>In the shadow of the mountain : a historical re-evaluation of the 1988 Outremont dispute</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s4655j707.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9w032518b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Jewish Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:b2773x82r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:10Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study considers the phenomenon of the sudden and brief appearance of clay figurines in west-central Kyushu towards the end of the Jomon Period (13,000-2,300 14C years BP). The baked clay figurines representing humans were made throughout the Jomon Period, but mostly in central and northern Honshu. Following a review of previous interpretations of the Jomon clay figurines in general, the study focuses on the case of the numerous figurines recovered at the Kaminabe (ca. 2,800 14C years BP) site in Kyushu. Data on lithic assemblages and plant remains at Kaminabe and the sites in the surrounding area during the period under consideration indicate that small-scale cultivation was being practiced in the region.

The following criteria were developed to investigate these differences: quantity in production, the use of verbs and conjugations. Eleven boys and thirteen girls from the same fourth grade class located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, participated in this study. Both quantitative and qualitative data were gathered through one-on-one audiotaped story retelling sessions and questionnaires. This analysis did not reveal any gender differences but instead similarities were found in relation to the types of errors they made. Limitations, such as the number of participants, or the variation across participants' inhibition, memory, and creativity may have affected the results. It is suggested that these results may be linked to a lack of opportunity to speak French in the classroom, and that the use of a story retelling activity might be one way to encourage speaking.</description><creator>Gavard, Karen</creator><date>2003</date><subject>French language -- Study and teaching -- Immersion method.</subject><subject>Sex differences (Psychology) in children.</subject><title>Gender differences and oral production in French immersion</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pn89d8721.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jh343v18k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Second Language Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4x51hm38w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>National Identity, Ethnic Identity, Minoritiness...These are all categories which appear to have existed always already, categories which seem to be normative by nature. They are determinative, for they position human beings on different levels of the social ladder and organize strategically human interrelations. Yet, while these same apparently transcendental categories appropriate a position of universality, they also claim to be particular to a specific place, a specific people, a specific race etc. The disjunction inherent in these categories can be realized within this ideological contradiction. It is therefore this very disjunction that calls upon the rethinking of identity in relation to nation, ethnicity and minority. In this thesis I offer a translation of nine separate excerpts from Kobayashi Aya's account on Burakumin experience in Japan. The author's contemplation on Japaneseness and Minoritiness, her questioning of national identity as a category and of this category as predetermined become the focus of my work. While outlining the structure of Kobayashi's writing and the methods she chooses to employ, I analyze the concepts of performativity, repetition and disruption as potential options for rethinking Japaneseness and Minoritiness as categories of identity.</description><creator>Mutafchieva, Rositsa</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Japanese literature -- Women authors.</subject><subject>Kobayashi, Aya, 1928- -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><title>Minoritarian discourse in Japan : Kobayashi Aya's account of Burakumin experience</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bv73c284j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hm38w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of East Asian Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hq37vq635</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The religious tribulations which occurred in the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Northumbria, are often interpreted as beneficiary for the development of religious architecture and monasticism of this northern kingdom.

Due to its inter-disciplinary nature, the SRE implementation involves several cooperating daemons running over a heterogeneous network. As the system evolves, coordinating these daemons becomes a challenging task. Our early effort, a text-based controller, remains insufficient because of its command-line interface and lack of daemon launch capability. In order to facilitate easy daemon administration, we have developed a graphical interface known as the SRE control panel, or SRECPan. The SRECPan is designed to assist the user in manipulating the SRE daemons, monitoring their performance, managing the configuration, and visualizing a comprehensive working status from every cooperating daemon. In this thesis, we present our SRECPan design, covering structural decomposition,  naming convention, behavioural dynamics, graphical interface, and user configuration. As each design aspect is described with its advantages and limitations, we will refer to relevant alternative solutions investigated during the development process. For some design elements, possible extensions and potential to cope with the ongoing SRE effort are indicated.</description><creator>Gu, Jin Hua</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical</subject><title>A graphical control panel for the shared reality environment</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jm214r33x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2z10ws58r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:q524jr02p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T04:25:14Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Fiber reinforced concrete with postpeak strain hardening type of response contributes significantly to the load carrying capacity, the impact and fatigue resistance and the reduced crack opening width, and is developed for special applications when large energy absorption capacity is required. While the strain hardening fiber reinforced cement paste and mortar are extensively studied, the strain hardening fiber reinforced concrete (SHFRC) with large quantity of coarse aggregates is not readily achievable. In this research, two approaches were investigated to fabricate strain hardening fiber reinforced concrete with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fiber and steel fiber: One used polymer addition and the other employed hybrid fiber reinforcement. The results showed that both PVA fibers and steel fibers with hooked flat ends could be used to produce fiber reinforced concrete with strain hardening behavior. With polymer modification and hybrid fiber system, the hardening response was enhanced. Fiber reinforced concretes were tested under severe environmental condition: freeze-thaw cycling and drying shrinkage. The results indicated that PVA fibers were vulnerable to cold temperature change and the strain hardening behavior deteriorated under freeze-thaw cycling. Polymer modification could protect the polymer fibers from frost damage. The strain hardening fiber reinforced concrete did not show its ability to delay crack initiation under severe drying condition. Finally, a toughness method (Ductility factor) was proposed to quantify the strain-hardening behavior.</description><creator>Jiang, Liying</creator><date>2003</date><subject>Engineering, Civil</subject><title>Strain-hardening behavior of fiber reinforced concrete</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k930c048k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/q524jr02p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):2700</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
