For, in the past man's loyalty had been due not to the nation-state or nationality, but to differing forms of social authority, political organization and ideological cohesion such as tribe or clan, the city state or the feudal lord, the dynastic state, the church or the religious group. During the Middle Ages there are hardly any traces of nationalism, either in the Islamic World or Christendom. In those times, the abject of popular loyalty was not nationality but religion.

During May, June and September, 1957, a study of the bogs in the Knoh Lake area was made. The primary objective was to make a field check on a classification which had been made from air photographs during the winter of 1956-57. It is not intended as a Botanical study, but is a consideration of the physical characteristics and surface features, in an attempt to explain their mode of occurrence.

During the last decade or so, the phenomenon of the mechanization of material handling in modern industry has developed into immense proportions. But the problem of the handling of granular material through orifices lies, obviously, at the very root of this tremendous development. The present study is an attempt to contribute to the solution of this problem. Laboratory investigations were conducted with Ottawa Sand, glass bins, sand-paper bins and circular orifices. The effect of head, diameter of bin, diameter of orifice, roughness of bin walls and vibrations on the flow were studied. Graphs were plotted and the flow constants ascertained.</description><creator>Ahmed, Syed. I.</creator><contributor>Craig, C.

B. Yeats wrote, “Of all artistic forms that have had a large share of the world’s attention, the worst is the play about modern educated people. Except where it is super ficial or deliberately argumentative it fills one's soul with a sense of commonness as with dust.” Elsewhere he observed, “I think the theatre must be reformed in its plays, its speaking, its acting, and its scenery…. There is nothing good about it at present.” One can hardly doubt that T.S. Eliot was aware of the foregoing conclusions when, in 1939, he took his first step on the commercial stage; and for a “classicist in literature, royalist in politics, and anglo-catholic in religion" it was a bold step indeed.</description><creator>Winter, Jack.

The indirect method, widely used in public schools, involves learning the new language vocabulary by translation, through the presentation of foreign words together with their semantic equivalents in the native language. The direct method, favored by many theorists, is intended to approximate the method of learning a first language. Ideally, the native language is not used at all; new words are associated directly with environmental events or learned through the second-language context in which they appear.</description><creator>Wimer, Cynthia.

Our aim is to investigate the properties of the medium created in a relativistic nucleus-nucleus collision, using the electromagnetic decays of vector mesons as probe. To do so, we first layout the foundations of Regge theory, which is then used to calculate the in-medium properties of vector mesons. This methodology will be used to calculate for the first time the properties of the ϕ meson in a hadronic medium. The properties are contained within the imaginary part of the propagator (IMPP). Since it is related to electromagnetic decay via vector meson dominance, the IMPP is a probe of strongly interacting hadron gas created in the collision.</description><creator>Vujanovic, Gojko.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Quantum chromodynamics.</subject><subject>Regge theory.</subject><subject>Vector mesons.</subject><title>A theoretical model for the in-medium spectral density of vector mesons /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bc386p32z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k643b473w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:d504rp91p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:20:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The peripheral naive CD4 T cell pool is homeostatically regulated through a balance of thymic production, delivery of survival signals and homeostatic proliferation. CD4 recent thymic emigrants (RTEs) have a high T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) content and express high levels of CD31. We report premature thymic involution in RRMS, initiated by reduced numbers of naive CD4 T cells and various naive CD4 T cell subsets in peripheral blood. Further, CXCR4, a receptor involved in emigration from the thymus, and CD127 and Bcl-2 (survival signals) are upregulated in various naive CD4 T cell subsets in RRMS. As a compensatory process, naive CD4 T cells undergo homeostatic proliferation. This proliferation is a form of peripheral positive selection through self-MHC/self-antigen interaction and thus can contribute to the expansion of autoreactive T cells and predispose to development of RRMS.</description><creator>Williams, Julia Leigh.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting -- immunology.</subject><subject>T-Lymphocyte Subsets -- immunology.</subject><subject>Thymus Gland -- immunology.</subject><subject>CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes -- immunology.</subject><title>Evidence of a thymic abnormality in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xw42nc56t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/d504rp91p</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pathology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qb98mk109</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:20:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>After the terrorist attacks that took place on September 11, 2001, on American soil, a plethora of norms that enable military forces to shoot-down hijacked civil aircraft have been passed in several countries. Although these laws, decrees and executive orders are grounded on security reasons and they are allegedly aimed to protect people and vital interests on ground, this assertion does not emasculate the main difficulty they face in legal terms, which is the existence of an international provision that forbids the use of force against civilian aircraft. This thesis contains a detailed list of such domestic norms and conducts an analysis of their validity from the perspective of Article 3bis of the Chicago Convention and the right of self-defense granted to states by the Charter of the United Nations.</description><creator>Luongo, Norberto E., 1962-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Self-defense (International law)</subject><subject>Necessity (International law)</subject><subject>Terrorism -- Prevention -- Law and legislation.</subject><subject>Hijacking of aircraft.</subject><subject>Aeronautics -- Law and legislation.</subject><title>&amp;quot;Shooting-down laws&amp;quot; : a quest for their validity</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/p5547w159.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qb98mk109</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cv43p185w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:20:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The main objective of this thesis is to study and investigate the dynamics and stability of cantilevered structures subjected to internal, external, or simultaneous internal and external axial flows. This was accomplished, in some cases, by deriving the linear equations of motion using a Newtonian approach and, in other cases, by making the necessary modifications to existing theoretical models. The continuous cantilevered systems were then discretized using the Galerkin method in order to determine their complex eigenfrequencies. Moreover, numerous experiments were performed to compare and validate, or otherwise, the theoretical models proposed. More specifically, the four cantilevered systems studied were the following: (i) a pipe conveying fluid that is fitted with a stabilizing end-piece, which suppresses flutter by blocking the straight-through exit of flow at the downstream end; (ii) a pipe aspirating fluid, which flutters at low flow velocities in its first mode; (iii) a free-clamped cylinder (i.e. with the upstream end free and the downstream end clamped) in confined axial flow, which also flutters at low flow velocities in its first mode and eventually develops a buckling instability; and (iv) a pipe subjected to internal flow, which after exiting the pipe is transformed to a confined counter-current annular flow, that becomes unstable by flutter too.</description><creator>Rinaldi, Stephanie.</creator><date>2009</date><subject>Pipe -- Fluid dynamics -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Nonlinear oscillations -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Flutter (Aerodynamics) -- Mathematical models.</subject><title>Experiments on the dynamics of cantilevered pipes subjected to internal andor external axial flow</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1g05fg498.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cv43p185w</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6w924g37f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:20:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This research presents a new, more efficient computational scheme for complex periodic flows, and brings forward two novel ideas. The first consists in the use of a Fourier space time representation in conjunction with a high-order spatial discretization. The second is based on the efficient treatment of the resulting set of equations using a fast, implicit solver. This thesis describes the formulation and implementation of the proposed framework. Firstly, a high-order spectral difference scheme for the Euler equations is introduced. Secondly, the non-linear frequency domain method resolving the unsteady behavior of the flow is discussed. Thirdly, a mathematical and experimental validation of the proposed algorithm is carried out. Numerical experiments performed in this thesis suggest that the methodology could be an attractive new avenue for large scale time-dependent problems, alleviating the computational cost traditionally associated with such simulations.</description><creator>Cagnone, Jean-Sébastien.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Unsteady flow (Fluid dynamics) -- Mathematical models.</subject><title>A non linear frequency domain-spectral difference scheme for unsteady periodic flows /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c247dx08r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6w924g37f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g732dd68r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:20:14Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Photochromic Molecular Flow Visualization is an in vitro, experimental technique that uses high speed image acquisition combined with an ultraviolet laser to capture instantaneous flow profiles. It is particularly adept at measuring near wall velocities which are necessary for accurate wall shear rate measurements. This thesis describes the implementation and validation of the technique at McGill. The system was used to investigate the wall shear rate patterns in an idealized 50% asymmetric stenosis model under steady flow for Reynolds numbers 206, 99 and 50. A large recirculation zone with flow reattachment was seen downstream of the stenosis with maximum shear values occurring slightly upstream of peak stenosis for Reynolds number 206. This information is vital to ongoing dynamic cell culture experiments aimed at understanding the progression of atherosclerosis.</description><creator>Chin, David, 1982-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Spirobenzopyran.</subject><subject>Photochromic materials.</subject><subject>Arteries -- Stenosis.</subject><subject>Fluid-structure interaction -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Image analysis -- Mathematical models.</subject><title>Wall shear patterns of a 50% asymmetric stenosis model using photochromic molecular flow visualization</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sf268896k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/g732dd68r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2227mt58v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:20:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Renal failure uremia occurs when the kidneys fail to function properly. Despite being the main treatment, dialysis and other therapeutic approaches are not only associated with numerous long-term adverse complications often leading to morbidity and mortality events, but are also not affordable. Orally administrating Alginate-Poly-L-Lysine-Alginate microcapsules entrapping live yeast cells to treat renal failure uremia has not yet been investigated. In this thesis, the growth and microencapsulation of yeast were optimized. The efficacy of these microcapsules in removing unwanted electrolytes was tested in vitro in simulated gastro-intestinal media, in vitro in a column bioreactor and in vivo in an uremic rat model. Results showed that these novel microcapsules can not only maintain morphological stability and membrane integrity under gastro-intestinal environments and mechanical stresses, but also, preserve the viability of yeast. These microcapsules were successful in reducing urea concentrations while not harming the human GI tract's microbial flora.</description><creator>Coussa, Razek.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Kidney Failure -- therapy.</subject><subject>Capsules.</subject><subject>Uremia -- therapy.</subject><subject>Alginates.</subject><subject>Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</subject><title>Artificial cell live yeast microcapsule formulation for use in renal failure uremia</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3197xq36f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2227mt58v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biomedical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0p096b737</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:20:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this conceptual inquiry, I argue how and why homework contributes to inequality. Homework contributes to inequality systemically, as schools continue to rely heavily on it. Homework continues to contribute to inequality discursively and psychologically, as parents and educators encourage homework without fully realizing the consequences of homework for those students who have difficulty completing school tasks at home. The inequalities maintained by homework often persist unnoticed. This persistence is an example of a broader persistence of sociological problems even as technological advances are made. This imbalance in the two domains of society and technology is due partly to the differences in the nature of the knowledge content. Therefore, educators and policy makers must be vigilant against tendencies to be blind to possibilities for improvement. One such improvement is a ban on mandatory homework, which implies more school responsibility to enable student achievement in the school.</description><creator>Boychuk, Tuutalik.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Academic achievement.</subject><subject>Education -- Social aspects.</subject><subject>Homework.</subject><title>Homework and inequality : school responsibility and enabling student achievement in the school</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cn69m765x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0p096b737</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Curriculum and Instruction</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pr76f729d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:20:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Filipino youth in Montreal have one of the highest rates of not being in school. Reports of behavioural problems, difficulties integrating, school failure and parent-child relationship difficulties have been reported among Filipino Youth who came to Canada after their mothers came to work in Canada under the Live-In Caregiver Program and its predecessor, the Foreign Domestic Movement. Using a sociocultural framework, I interviewed seven Filipino youth to examine the factors that interact to influence their educational outcomes. I discovered that several of their problems were related to long periods of family separation. The inability to develop a close relationship with their mother, along with economic struggles was a source of difficulty and directly affected educational outcomes. The focus of learning French in order to do well in the Quebec High School system is another factor affecting the ability of Filipino youth to succeed in school.</description><creator>Caro, Josie Fely.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Filipinos -- Education -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><subject>Filipinos -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><title>The educational experiences of Filipino youth in Quebec in the context of global migration /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mk61rm91h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pr76f729d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):17575</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
