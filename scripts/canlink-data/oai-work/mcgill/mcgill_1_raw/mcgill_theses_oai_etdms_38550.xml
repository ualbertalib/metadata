For the combined process the inlet and both outlet air flow rates were held constant throughout drying, thereby providing results appropriate for analysis of the complex and interacting kinetics. Pure impingement drying rate curves were quantified with three parameters which were related to drying process conditions: constant drying rate, critical moisture content and the exponent for a power law relationship over the falling rate period. The Churchill - Usagi asymptotic approach model was tested and found not applicable. For pure through drying the constant drying rate period disappears at higher drying intensities leaving two drying rate periods, the increasing rate and falling rate periods. A theoretically based exponential relationship was obtained for the increasing rate period, where up to 47% of the drying may occur. Drying rate curves were quantified with no subjective judgements, using five parameters: moisture contents at the end of the increasing rate and constant rate periods, constant drying rate, and exponents for the increasing and falling rate period relations. A universal normalized drying rate curve was obtained. Through drying rates are the same with or without impinging jets. In combined impingement and through air drying, an adiabatic process, removal of impingement boundary layer humidity by through flow makes both components of the process nonadiabatic. Relative to pure impingement drying, impingement water removal rates are sensitively reduced by through flow. Because critical moisture content is intrinsically lower for through drying than impingement drying, through flow water removal rate curves can be strikingly different from pure through drying, with addition of a unique feature, a secondary increasing rate period when paper temperature is driven up by the falling rate period of impingement water removal. Parameters for quantitative representation were determined, analyzed and related to drying process conditions. Of two prior models for the combined impingement and through air drying of paper, trends assumed by Randall (1984) are now found contrary to actual rates while the Crotogino and Allenger (1979) model has the trends correct but over predicts the drying rates now measured. Results of the pilot plant work of Burgess et al. (1972) are consistent with the comprehensive model now developed to predict drying time and drying rate for combined impingement and through flow air drying of paper.</description><creator>Chen, Guohua, 1963-</creator><contributor>Douglas, W.

An in-line square array with pitch-to-diameter ratio P/d = l.5 has been tested in both water- (with low mass ratio, $m/pd sp2$ = 6.5) and air-flow (with high mass ratio, $m/pd sp2$ = 860). The effect of fluidelastic coupling between cylinders on the critical flow velocity for fluidelastic instability was investigated via frequency detuning experiments, including an extreme case of one flexible cylinder in an otherwise rigid cylinder array. The water tunnel experimental results showed that fluidelastic coupling between cylinders in water-flow has little effect on the critical flow velocity for fluidelastic instability, whereas the wind tunnel experimental results demonstrated that fluidelastic coupling between cylinders in airflow has a significant effect on the critical flow velocity. Therefore, for the cases with low mass ratio parameter the negative fluid damping mechanism dominated the fluidelastic instability of the array; however, for cases with high mass ratio, fluidelastic instability of the array was controlled by fluid stiffness effects. An in-line square array with P/d = l.5 was also tested in the wind tunnel, with cylinders with high and low levels of mechanical damping. The experimental results showed that fluidelastic coupling between cylinders with low mechanical damping has a more significant effect on the critical flow velocity for fluidelastic instability than with high mechanical damping in airflow (with high mass ratio, $m/pd sp2$ = 860); hence, fluid stiffness-controlled mechanism becomes more important for fluidelastic instability of the array with low mechanical damping in airflow. Next, an in-line square array with P/d = 3.0 was tested in the wind tunnel. The results showed that one flexible cylinder becomes unstable when positioned in row 2 of the array; however, it does not become unstable when positioned in rows 3 or 4. This suggests that P/d has a large effect on fluidelastic instability behaviour of in-line square arrays. Finally, a new constrained-mode approach, with a one-cylinder-kernel, has been developed for the instability analysis of both in-line and staggered arrays. The approach was developed to reduce the computational effort when a fully flexible cylinder array has to be analyzed, in order to take into account fluidelastic coupling; between cylinders.</description><creator>Cheng, Boqian</creator><date>1994</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>The mechanisms underlying flow-induced instability of cylinder arrays in cross-flow : an investigation of system parameters</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/73666650c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0g354h25m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6d56zz49f</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Itcha Volcanic Complex (IVC) is the easternmost shield of a series of bimodal central volcanic complexes which comprise the Anahim Volcanic Belt (AVB) in central British Columbia. The IVC lavas are distinctly bimodal, with a compositional gap between 52 and 58 wt% SiO$ sb2$ comprising late basaltic and hawaiitic lavas and early felsic lavas of Si-undersaturated to Si-oversaturated character. The hawaiite lavas dominate the late capping stage of the IVC. Their high Sr/Zr ratios indicate that they were derived by crystal fractionation of a clinopyroxene-dominated assemblage at high pressures ($ sim$10 kbar) from parental magmas with compositions similar to the most primitive alkali olivine basalts in the IVC. The majority of later evolved basalts have low Sr/Zr ratios indicating they formed by crystal fractionation at lower pressures. The similarity of isotopic and the incompatible element ratios suggests that the felsic and mafic magmas of the IVC are co-genetic. The early basal trachytes were derived by an AFC process in crustal magma chambers and appear to have assimilated a significant (15-20%) crustal component. Later, more evolved felsic lavas exhibit a wider range of Si-saturation, which appears to require parental basaltic magmas with a range of silica saturations with less, and more selective, crustal contamination. The compositional gap between the mafic and the felsic lavas of the Itcha shield appears to be related to the difficulty of erupting crystal-rich viscous lavas of intermediate composition. Viscosity models indicate that the rise in viscosity with decreasing Mg is slower at high pressures, which would favour the eruption of lavas of more evolved composition. Late balsanites have distinct Nb/Zr and isotopic signatures (low $ rm sp{87}Sr/ sp{86}$Sr), requiring a mantle source distinct from that of the alkali olivine basalts.</description><creator>Charland, Anne</creator><contributor>Francis, Don (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Geochemistry.</subject><subject>Geology.</subject><title>Stratigraphy, geochemistry and petrogenesis of the itcha volcanic complex, central British Columbia</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sq87bw46r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6d56zz49f</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p5547t44b</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis has examined the association between the expression of a cell adhesion molecule, epithelial-cadherin (E-cadherin), and rat embryo malformations induced by three model teratogens and an E-cadherin antisense oligonucleotide during organogenesis in vitro. The embryo malformations induced by phosphoramide mustard (PAM), an active metabolite of an anticancer drug, cyclophosphamide, were not associated with any change in the expression of E-cadherin. The embryo malformations induced by exposure to the phorbol ester, 12-0-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), were associated with an increased steady state concentration of E-cadherin mRNA in the embryo, but not in the yolk sac. This increase in E-cadherin mRNA did not seem to be the cause of the embryo malformations. Exposure of embryos to the heavy metal, cadmium chloride, resulted in an increase in the steady state concentration of E-cadherin protein in the yolk sac, but not in the embryo. The timing of this increase would suggest that it may be one of the factors leading to the embryo malformations. An 18-base E-cadherin antisense oligodeoxynucleotide, injected into the amniotic cavity of 5-7 somite stage rat embryo, down regulated the expression of E-cadherin in the yolk sac, and caused specific open anterior neuropore malformations. Together, these data would suggest that E-cadherin expression is regulated in a tissue-specific manner, and that altering the expression of E-cadherin in the yolk sac is associated with embryo malformations.</description><creator>Chen, Beiyun</creator><date>1994</date><subject>Health Sciences, Toxicology.</subject><title>Association between epithelial-cadherin and rat embryo malformations during organogenesis in vitro</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m613n0633.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p5547t44b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0r967569f</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Conventional and radical approaches alike to the anthropological study of social change and economic development have fallaciously attempted to examine complex and mutable underlying social and historical processes by means of abstract theoretical structures. Through a critical focus on the contemporary marxian debate over modes of production, a new and potentially more fruitful direction for economic anthropology and development studies is proposed here in the form of an hypothesis concerning imperialism. Imperialism is hypothesized to constitute such a complex and mutable process inseverably bound to that of capitalist development throughout the latter's history. Attempting in a gradually maturing manner to accumulate capital by any possible means, metropolitan ruling classes have persistently been forced to intervene in and distort local processes of class struggle and transformation in other social formations. But continuously changing processes of so-called economic "underdevelopment" must therefore necessarily have been imposed on peripheral areas of metropolitan nations and regions just as they have on colonies and neo-colonies of the Third World. An initial test of this hypothesis is thus afforded by the "domestic" case of the northern New England state of Vermont in the USA before 1870. Particular emphasis is placed on the crucial period of rapid U.S. capitalist development after 1830, as an incipient process of proletarianization was distorted and delayed in rural hinterland Vermont well beyond such processes taking place on the nearby northeastern seaboard. The initiation of peripheral capitalist development in Vermont is analyzed in terms of the substitution for native-born free peasants of an ethnically distinct, "super-exploited" immigrant proletariat in a few rural export enclaves, as the former direct producers began emigrating permanently instead to the established industrial cities on the seaboard. Vermont's changing relative economic "underdevelopment" within New England and within the USA as a whole from 1870 through the 1970's is discussed in a summary chapter. The initial confirmation in the Vermont case of this hypothesis concerning imperialism and capitalist development suggests it must be seriously considered in cases of contemporary economic "underdevelopment" elsewhere.</description><creator>Sloan, William N.</creator><contributor>Peter C.W.

Therefore, besides the predictions of thermomechanical history, the prediction of microstructure represents an important aspect of the modeling of plastics processing. A comprehensive model has been developed to describe the behaviour of thermoplastic polymer melts during the injection molding process. The model, which deals with the three stages of the process (filling, packing and cooling), employs a viscoelastic constitutive equation and incorporates crystallization kinetics. All the properties of the material employed are based on experimental data. The model predicts fill times, velocity, temperature and pressure distributions, the distribution of shear and normal stresses, and stress relaxation. The predictions of the model are compared to experimental data relating to pressure distributions and variation with time, fill times, and the distributions of crystallinity, orientation and tensile modulus.</description><creator>Lafleur, Pierre G.</creator><contributor>M.

The problems considered are in the area of clustering and classification. These problems are: (i) computing the diameter of a finite planar set, (ii) computing the maximum and minimum distance between two finite planar sets of points, (iii) testing for point inclusion in a convex polyhedron in d-dimensional space, and (iv) exact and inexact reference set thinning for the nearest neighbor decision rule. Algorithms to solve the above problems are presented and analyzed for worst-case and average-case situations. These algorithms are implemented and experimentally compared with the existing algorithms. In solving the above problems, a geometrical construct, known as the Voronoi diagram is used extensively. However, there exists no practical algorithm to construct the Voronoi diagram in d dimensional spaces when d &gt; 2. In this thesis an efficient algorithm to construct the Voronoi diagram in d-space is presented.</description><creator>Bhattacharya, Binay K.</creator><contributor>Godfried T.

This study had two objectives: to describe and analyse how McGill Students for Literacy tutors understand literacy and how they behave toward their learners and toward their organization, and to understand why many tutors distance themselves and their match from the organization. 18 McGill Students for Literacy tutors participated in semi-structured interviews with the researcher in this organizational case study. The hypothesis states that tutors choose autonomy from the literacy organization because of certain beliefs related to their attitudes as volunteers and to the organization's focus on individualized learning. These beliefs are: one-on-one instruction succeeds where classroom-based instruction has not, individual attention compensates for lack of training, good-will is better than good training, and volunteer activities can be justified on the basis of perceived need rather than demonstrable progress.</description><creator>Hambly, Catherine.</creator><contributor>Ghosh, Ratna (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Tutors and tutoring -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- Case studies.</subject><subject>Literacy programs -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- Case studies.</subject><subject>Peer-group tutoring of students -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- Case studies.</subject><title>Behaviour and beliefs of volunteer literacy tutors</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mg74qn967.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3j3334318</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Culture and Values in Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zg64tn92w</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In the development of Islam in India in the nineteenth century, the impact of the interaction between modernist Muslims and Christian administrators and missionaries can be seen in the writings of three Evangelical Christians on the role of the H&amp;dotbelow;adith and the responses of Indian Muslims.

These states, with their existence assured by international recognition, are not primarily concerned with externally generated threats. Their internal characteristics violate the tenants of the realist theory, because they have more than one nation within their borders. The domestic conditions of these states make them internally insecure and weak---the threat of ethnic conflict great. As such, placing security in the military sphere alone, ignores these contradictions which lead to an insecurity dilemma. Thus, the concept of security needs to be broadened to include, not merely the military but also the political, societal and economic factors. The threat posed to state security from dissenting ethnic groups is both a domestic and foreign policy issue. It is within this discussion, that the thesis examines Turkey's security predicament with regards to her Kurdish minority.</description><creator>Gavrielides, Stala M.</creator><contributor>Meadwell, H.

For Jabes, citation holds a central place in the book: it is one of the main elements which subverts the literary text. It is not an addition, an artifice or a purely stylistic process through which the text is reinforced and given credibility: it is the essence of writing, and the understanding of its importance made it possible for the writer to continue writing in spite of what he perceived as the failure of western culture after Auschwitz.

Remembering an event in this manner implies that both a physical and temporal distance exists between an individual watching from afar and the event in question. This distance indicates that the event is never transparent nor is its meaning self-evident; it unfolds over time and is rendered almost incomprehensible through the proliferation of language and discourse surrounding the event, the fragmentary nature of its remnants, and the fallibility of both individual memory and the historical record. But instead of making the event meaningless, notions of 'distance' and 'incomprehensibility' provide a space where an event's meaning is most understandable for an individual. Beginning with Wittgenstein's Tractatus and ending with Barthes' A Lover's Discourse, I would like to show how little separates the philosopher attempting to understand the world, the historian interpreting the historical record, the amorous subject deciphering the signs and gestures of an absent or unattainable lover, and the individual remembering a historical event.</description><creator>Clearwater, David A.</creator><contributor>Kaite, Berkeley (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1998</date><subject>Flashbulb memory</subject><subject>Challenger (Spacecraft) -- Accidents</subject><title>"Where were you when...?" : the interaction of the personal and the historical in the Challenger explosion</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dr26z034m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5t34sm39k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Graduate Communications Program</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ks65hf12j</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study investigates the extent to which the elements of Confucian thought, survive and are practiced in the curriculum of Hong Kong secondary schools. It briefly examines the historical background of Confucianism in moral education in China and Hong Kong, examines curriculum guidelines and reference materials issued by the Hong Kong Education Department, and reports on interviews with two supervisors, seven principals and twenty-five teachers. It includes their perceptions of the locus of responsibility for moral education, their assessment of recent curriculum trends, their views on the impact of Confucian values on youth and their speculations on the future of moral education as Hong Kong is reintegrated with mainland China. Overall the study finds that elements of Confucian thought continue to prevail in the teaching of some school subjects and in the quality of school life; however, teachers are generally apprehensive about the erosion of Confucian values in the face of alternative models of moral education and the forces of modernization.</description><creator>Chong, Man-Lee Isabel.</creator><contributor>Smith, David C.

The primary focus is on the verbal language, or meta-language, derived from participant interviews that students used to describe their written texts. M. A. K. Halliday's (1978) social theory of language, and L. S. Vygotsky's (1962) sociopsychological theories of language provided a framework for conceptualizing the amount of control, self regulation, that students perceive they had in constructing coherent written discourse. Results from the study indicate that although students may have individual terminology about coherence, collegial students with the most successful self-regulated strategies described coherence across disciplines, and global features of text organization. Results also indicate that there is a lack of synchrony between students and teachers' interpretation of written tasks assigned in this French collegial institutional setting.</description><creator>Colpitts, Christa.</creator><contributor>Maguire, Mary (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Cohesion (Linguistics)</subject><subject>Metalanguage.</subject><title>Student perceptions of coherence in their written texts</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Christa Colpitts, 1997</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vx021h17f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w3763897x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Second Language Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:tm70mx463</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>It is inevitable that works on waqf written in English will employ terms from Anglo-American law to describe that institution. This study will endeavour to provide a proper understanding of these terms in order to clear up longstanding misconceptions of the nature of waqf. Through a detailed history of the Anglo-American law of endowments and its terminology, this study will create a framework through which it may be possible to obtain a clearer understanding of waqf. The study will also address two historical events in which the Islamic and Anglo-American legal conceptions of endowments have been at odds, as well as address the objections that have been raised to the continued existence of waqf , both from within Muslim society and from without. It is hoped that through this study a better appreciation of the utility of waqf for Muslim society will be achieved.</description><creator>Christoffersen, Keith.</creator><contributor>Hallaq, W.

A new brachytherapy dosimetry protocol, recently proposed by the American Association of Physicists in Medicine Task Group 43, has the advantage of using functions derived solely from measurements performed in the medium and uses a more realistic source geometry than the point source approximation. The aim of this work is to obtain the dosimetric functions required by this new protocol for both a low and a high dose-rate Iridium-192 brachytherapy source through dose measurements in a water-equivalent phantom. Dose measurements have been performed using lithium fluoride thermoluminescent detectors positioned in a polystyrene phantom at distances from the source that vary from 1 cm to 10 cm, with 1-cm intervals, and at angles that vary from 0$ sp circ$ to 170$ sp circ$ with 10$ sp circ$ intervals. Our experimental results have clearly shown that the point-source approximation model can overestimate the dose to water, especially for the high dose-rate source, where we have found that differences between point-source estimates and exact measured values can differ by almost 30% for points along the longitudinal axis of the source.</description><creator>Anctil, Jean-Claude.</creator><contributor>Clark, Brenda G.

The early community directed its attention towards institution building centred around Saint Patrick's church, which had been built for the use of Irish Catholics in the 1840s. Following the dismemberment of the extensive parish of Notre-Dame and the erection of smaller Irish national parishes in the early 1870s, greater emphasis was placed on the creation of a wide variety of parish societies. By discouraging participation in Irish national societies that refused to submit to clerical authority, and by effectively fusing religious and national identification, the clergy ensured the success of parish-based organisation. Broader associations embracing the various Irish-Catholic parish societies were established, and participation in the Saint Patrick's day procession inscribed these affiliations in space. It will be demonstrated that the territorial and social evolution of parishes were intimately connected.</description><creator>Trigger, Rosalyn.</creator><contributor>Olson, Sherry (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Irish Canadians -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- History -- 19th century.</subject><subject>Irish Canadians -- Ethnic identity.</subject><subject>Montréal (Québec) -- History -- 19th century.</subject><subject>Parishes -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- History -- 19th century</subject><title>The role of the parish in fostering Irish-Catholic identity in nineteenth-century Montreal /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rb68xd654.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4b29b801x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:37720f874</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A burgeoning mega-club in the heart of Montreal's gay village, Sky embodies many forces active in gay club cultures and villages across North America at the end of the twentieth century. This project documents the daily operations of Sky--as a complex architectural site, a complicated set of managerial practices, and a popular space in Montreal's Village--and outlines the theoretical implications of such an establishment for both the gay community and for club culture more generally. A large entertainment complex currently undergoing a major expansion, Sky cannot be theorized as either a wholly oppressive or completely liberatory development. Although Sky presents some of the advantages of a mega-club for the gay community--increased diversity, accessibility and community--it also highlights the disadvantages in the development of such establishments: concentration of ownership, the removal of a gay presence from city streets, and the promotion of certain gay identities and cultures over others.</description><creator>Allan, James, 1971-</creator><contributor>Straw, Will (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Gay bars -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- Case studies.</subject><subject>Sky (Bar : Montréal, Québec)</subject><subject>Gays -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- Social life and customs.</subject><title>Sky's the limit : the operations, renovations and implications of a Montréal gay bar</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/w37638986.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/37720f874</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Graduate Communications Program</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:j3860885c</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis examines the use of orality as a means to self-definition in Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. The main contention of this thesis is that within the Vampire Chronicles orality defines the self through incorporation, and that the bodily incorporation of food through a sexual consumption leads the vampire to naturally evolve a sense of who he or she is at any given moment in time. It is in this manner that this article discusses how the body, sexuality, food, and the possession of financial capital define and limit the individual's notion of self.</description><creator>Chandler, Anthony N.</creator><contributor>Bristol, Michael D.

The goal of this critical practice can be described as at once diagnostic and prescriptive, as scholars attempt to rid the canon of specious documents through rigorous textual and contextual analyses. It is my contention, however, that this critical winnowing, rather than rescuing some hagiographic documents from disrepute, is in fact limited by its failure to adequately account for the medieval concern for representation as a re-presencing of the self within language. Understood through the criteria of contemporary biography, saints' lives are easily read as naive caricatures of holiness, archetypes of faith fitted crudely into human form. Instead, the notion of singular identity should be understood as a focal point for hagiography, one that presupposes important theological, and specifically incarnational, underpinnings. An exploration along these lines will reveal what I believe to be an important function of medieval hagiography; namely, to serve as textual bridges joining the sacred and corporeal realms in coincident moments of human transcendence and divine immanence.</description><creator>Cahill, James, 1969-</creator><date>1996</date><subject>Hagiography.</subject><title>Locating the sacred body in time : a study in hagiography and historical identity</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3f462738z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2n49t395b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:df65v969q</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The subject of this thesis is the female characters' way of seeing in the works of Colette. Colette helps liberate women from an oppressive concept of femininity, this being the ultimate goal of the postmodern feminists (Helene Cixous and Luce Irigaray). In Colette's works we find several characteristics that show her resistance to the dominant ideology, the most important being an emphasis placed elsewhere than upon things considered important in patriarchal culture. Renee Nere of La Vagabonde, novelist and music-hall mime, is examined in the second chapter. For Renee, liberty is more important than the security of the established identity which marriage offers. The pain associated with her choice to remain alone underscores the oppression that she must bear. "Colette" in La Naissance du jour is studied in Chapter Three. There we discuss the importance of "Sido" in the construction of "Colette's" life model, a construction that never ends. The differences between mother (poet) and daughter (novelist) are studied along with their similarities. Again, reflection and writing are found to be more noble than love.</description><creator>Carman, Jodi Rebecca.</creator><contributor>Duquette, J. P.

In this thesis I concentrate on Aitmatov's short stories which I consider to be one of the most important aspects of his work. What is so particular about Aitmatov's short stories? How does he manage to condense in his short stories such a deep meaning such a refined and sensitive world of heroes, together with the very essence of being? His pure and sometimes naive stories characterized by deep philosophical thought lead us to ponder over both contemporary and eternal problems of humanity and cultural consciousness. I will be analyzing a few short stories which, in my opinion, best reflect how perfectly Aitmatov mastered the art of shaping material into an original text with peculiar structure and plot. My work consists of an introduction, three chapters and conclusion where I define in detail the concepts of "structure", "plot", "fable" and other elements of prose, architechtonics, material organization, etc., and how these concepts are treated in Aitmatov's short stories.</description><creator>Enguibarian, Loussine.</creator><contributor>Austin, Paul M.

In the 1980s, World Music was a term useful for describing popular music in fusion with ethnic music. That fact has lead many to an association of the term exclusively with that new genre. In this study I define World Music in Western art-music---from an historical perspective as well as with regard to musical style, ideology, and aesthetics and give examples of various composers' approaches. In the ideological discussion, the debate over "exotic" music and musical borrowings turns out to have many points of contact with the notions of modernism and postmodernism. I exemplify and test my ideas by using the stylistic development of Swedish-Canadian composer Bengt Hambraeus as a case study and discuss ideological and musical applications to the concept of World Music in relation to Hambraeus's piece Nocturnals for Chamber Ensemble (1990).</description><creator>Broman, Per F.</creator><contributor>Morris, Mitchell (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1997</date><subject>Hambræus, Bengt, 1928-</subject><subject>World music -- History and criticism.</subject><title>Bengt Hambræus's notion of World Music : philosophical and aesthetical boundaries</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6d56zz506.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w66345711</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g158bk09w</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:51:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is an attempt to assess the importance of the satirical photo essay Deutschland, Deutschland uber alles in the life and literary development of the German author Kurt Tucholsky, and to help establish the significance of the work in the German literary canon. The work appeared in 1929, and marked a complete departure from his previous output in many respects. He experimented with the genre of photo essay and photomontage in collaboration with renowned montage artist and dedicated Communist John Heartfield, attempted to reach a new reading audience in the German working classes, and published the book in a radical publishing house with strong ties to the German Communist Party. However, despite the successful combination of photograph, photomontage and text which allowed Tucholsky and Heartfield to produce many insightful and scathing criticisms of Weimar society, the book largely failed to deliver a relevant social or political criticism of the Weimar Republic. Tucholsky's criticisms were directed toward the ruling Social Democratic Party and other parties of the bourgeois political establishment, but he ignored or refused to see the far greater threat posed by the rising tide of National Socialism.
