A segmented quadrupole rod system was used to create a static axially confining field that could trap and cool an ion cloud from a DC ion source. In addition, an adjustable extraction field was applied, after sufficient ion collection, by pulsing the trapping rod segments to send the cooled ion cloud into a collinear Time-of-Flight spectrometer. Two chevron stacked multichannel plates, with a measured charge amplification of 3.75 x 107, were used as a detector at the end of the flight tube. The purpose of this work was to investigate ion dynamics in the linear trap (LTRAP) so as to determine the suitability of this system as a source for TOFMS. The trap was therefore designed to be relatively weak so that the ion collection volume would be large enough to obtain a detailed picture of the cloud. The system was tested using a Cs+ (m/ z =133) ion source. Optimal parameters were found to be an applied well depth of -5V to -15V with a q value between 0.3 and 0.6 in a buffer gas environment of N2 at pressures of 10 -4 Torr or greater. Under these conditions and a cooling/collection time of 50ms the trap was observed to contain about 2500 ions. This translated to a detection efficiency of about 26.7% of the ions entering LTRAP. Computer simulations based on a thermodynamic model were created to analyze the experimental data. The ion ensemble was found to reach an equilibrium temperature of 0.0353 +/- 0.0025eV in less than 10ms. Another computer program was used to reconstruct the phase space density of the LTRAP collection from the detector signals. The results of this reconstruction agreed with the results obtained from the model fitting procedure thereby confirming the thermodynamic model. The phase space density distribution in LTRAP showed that with a time-focusing reflectron even this weak trap would have a m/Delta m = 250. This has led to guidelines for the construction of a high-resolution hybrid mass spectrometer using a linear ion trap. Based on these current results, a mass resolution of almost 10,000 is predicted as an upper limit of this type of mass spectrometer.</description><creator>Fong, C. W.

The first one is the H+-ATPase for which the activity was characterized under various conditions of growth. The activity gradually increased by l.6 to 1.9-fold upon inoculation at pH 3.5. The H+-ATPase activity did not vary significantly in function of the growth rate or with and without malic acid. However, acidification of the medium in the absence of malic acid induced the activity by 1.5 to 2.2-fold depending on the initial pH. The partially cloned H+-ATPase genes shared high homologies with those from other bacterial F0F1-ATPases. A mRNA of about 7 kb was detected by Northern blot and its size suggests that the genetic organization of O. oeni atp operon is similar to most F0F 1-ATPases. Furthermore, the amount of atp mRNA was shown to increase in acidic conditions. O. oeni H +-ATPase activity was pH-inducible and regulation of the expression seems to occur at the level of mRNA synthesis. Thus, the results confirmed the proposed role of the H+-ATPase in acid tolerance in O. oeni. The second system studied was a chromosome-encoded P-type ATPase (CopB) and its putative transcriptional regulator (CopR). The copB gene encodes a protein showing great similarities with other Cu2+-ATPases of the CPx-type family of heavy-metal ATPases like Enterococcus hirae copB. Another gene (copR) was found 250 bp upstream of copB and displays great similarities with proteins of the MecI/BlaI family of transcriptional regulators, including En. hirae CopY repressor. O. oeni was shown to be highly resistant to copper and growth occurred in up to 30 mM CuSO4. Northern blot analyses indicated that the amount of copB mRNA increased upon a 0.2 to 4.0 mM copper stress suggesting that expression of the enzyme might be regulated at the level of mRNA synthesis. Whether CopR is involved in this regulation remains to be determined, but the results suggest that copRB genes might be involved in copper resistance in O. oeni.</description><creator>Fortier, Louis-Charles.</creator><contributor>Lee, Byong H.

Our laboratory previously isolated a melphalan resistant rat mammary carcinoma cell-line (MLNr MatB). The in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated increased GST activity, especially elevated GST alpha class in MLNr cells. At the outset of my work, I examined the nature of the increased GST form in MLNr cells. I cloned the GSTA3 cDNA which is overexpressed in MLNr cells and found that it is identical to the previously described GSTA3 mRNA, suggesting that there is no additional GST alpha gene induced by melphalan. To study the role of the rat GSTA3 gene in chemotherapy resistance, and understand the mechanism of its overexpression in drug resistant tumors, I isolated the entire rGSTA3 subunit gene, including its regulatory regions, from a genomic library and characterized it. The rGSTA3 gene is approximately 15 kb in length and consists of seven exons interrupted by introns of different lengths. The functional activity of its promoter was shown by its ability to drive the expression of a CAT reporter gene in MatB cells, and its activity was greater in melphalan resistant cells. I also presented evidence that rGSTA3 subunit evolved as a duplication of the rGSTA5 subunit gene, increasing the diversification and functional benefits. In addition to drug resistance, I have been examining the implications of GST to carcinogenesis. Epidemiological studies have shown an association between Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection and exposure to chemical carcinogens in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The exact mechanism of these interactions is not known, but reduced GST activity could increase cellular sensitivity to chemical carcinogens.

Mutational analysis has demonstrated the requirement of a single tyrosine within the carboxy-terminus (Y1356) of the Met receptor for the recruitment and activation of all Met-dependent signalling pathways and for the transformation of fibroblasts by the Tpr-Met oncogene. The selective abolishment of Grb2 from the Tpr-Met oncoprotein, by generating an asparagine to histidine mutation two amino acids downstream from Y1356 (N1358H), led to a reduction in Tpr-Met-mediated transformation of fibroblasts. Moreover, Met receptor studies demonstrate that while a Grb2 binding site is not required for epithelial cell motility, it is critical for the formation of branching tubules when cells are suspended in a collagen matrix. This suggests that Grb2-dependent pathways are involved in the organization and polarization of epithelial cells following Met receptor stimulation. Grb2 associated molecules, Gab1 and Cbl, are highly phosphorylated following stimulation of the Met receptor. Moreover, signaling pathways associated with Gab1 are critical for branching tubulogenesis in epithelial cells. Expression of a constitutively active version of Cbl, 70z-Cbl, results in an epithelial-mesenchymal transition, leading to the breakdown of cellular junctions and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. The amino-terminal SH2 domain is the minimal region required to induce morphological changes, which may be mediated through its interaction with the Met receptor, and/or an unidentified protein of 150 kDa.</description><creator>Fournier, Tanya M.</creator><contributor>Park, Morag (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>The role of signalling pathways downstream from the Grb2 adaptor protein in Met receptor and Tpr-Met oncoprotein biological activities /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x346d591x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/37720f49q</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z603r017r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:38:57Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The dystrophin associated protein (DAP) complex has been implicated in such basic physiological processes as the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, the assembly of basement membranes (BM), and synaptogenesis. The dystroglycans, alpha and beta, constitute the functional core of the DAP complex since they establish the transmembrane link between dystrophin, whose mutations lead to Duchenne (DMD) or Becker (BMD) muscular dystrophy, and the extracellular matrix (ECM). The alpha and beta subunits of dystroglycan result from posttranslational processing of a single propeptide encoded by DAG1. No clinical cases or animal models have been identified with spontaneous mutations in that gene. Therefore, to gain insight to the function of dystroglycans I have used gene targeting to disrupt the coding sequence of Dag1 in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells. We find that dystroglycans are critical in the early stages of development and that a null mutation in Dag1 results in embryonic lethality at embryonic day (E) 6.5 because of a disruption in Reichert's BM. In culture however, the absence of dystroglycan in ES cells targeted for both Dag1 alleles does not obviously hinder their developmental potential. Consequently, I reasoned that it might be possible to circumvent the early lethality observed in 'classical' knockout mice, by injecting Dag1-null ES cells into wild-type blastocysts to generate chimeric mice only partially devoid of dystroglycan. Several chimeric mice developed to maturity and Dag1 -null ES cells were found to contribute extensively to the hindlimb musculature thus allowing the analysis of dystroglycan depleted muscles. These muscles are severely dystrophic, have low levels of dystrophin and a disrupted residual DAP complex, but have apparently normal BMs. Chimeric muscles also have disrupted neuromuscular junctions. In culture, myotubes derived from Dag1-null ES cells form clusters of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) but these occupy a surface area three time</description><creator>Côté, Patrice D.</creator><contributor>Carbonetto, Salvatore (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</subject><title>Dystroglycan function in development and neuromuscular disease : a study by gene targeting</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9306t081p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z603r017r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n009w4031</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:38:58Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This project examined methods of boosting innate resistance, enhancing those cells responsible for mediating "immune surveillance", i.e., Natural Killer (NK) cells. NK cells represent the first line of defense against neoplastic cells, to which they are spontaneously cytolytic, without having had prior exposure. This work aimed, firstly, to determine the effects on NK cells of administration of the interferon inducer, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) in irradiated leukemic mice given a bone marrow transplant, with or without the administration of the NK enhancer, tumor necrosis factor-alpha. The results demonstrated NK cell enhancement and prolonged life span of the poly I:C-treated, leukemic hosts. Secondly, this work aimed to study the hormone, melatonin (MLT), as well as a commercially prepared extract from the herb Echinacea purpurea, on NK cells. The role of these agents was assessed on NK cells in both normal and leukemic young adult mice. The results showed that both MLT and E. purpurea are NK enhancers when administered separately, suggesting prophylactic and therapeutic roles for these agents. The third aim of this project was to determine the effects of an E. purpurea treatment protocol on the numbers and function of NK cells in elderly mice. The age-related decline in NK cell numbers and function in mice is well documented in laboratory animals and corresponds with the increased frequency of tumors in these animals. This project has shown the effectiveness of the above treatments, especially those utilizing the herb extract from E. purpurea in stimulating NK cell numbers and cytolytic function in healthy and leukemic mice. In summary, the entire project has shown the NK enhancing effects and life span prolongation in leukemic mice by using cytokines, hormones and herbal extracts.

These develop with experience in a fashion similar to how domain experts develop specialized knowledge structures and heuristic reasoning patterns. This research is extended to the domain of health and lay decision making in a series of studies characterizing conceptualizations of health and illness, information-seeking strategies, and the impact of medical information on lay decision making. Lay subjects included those with diabetes, heart disease, and no identified ongoing medical diagnosis. Semi-structured interviews and think aloud methodology were employed. Interviews focused on understanding of health and illness, prior knowledge and beliefs, and decision making. In Study One, subjects were presented with health-related problem scenarios and instructed to think aloud as they reasoned through them to make decisions. In Study Two, subjects (lay and medical) were presented with a telecommunications device and scenarios of data to enter into the system. All data were audiorecorded, transcribed, and analyzed for factors and strategies related to information-seeking and decision making behaviours. Lay understanding of health and illness was characterized as feeling well and functioning in everyday life. The knowledge used in making decisions was based on experience and socio-cultural tradition. Knowledge about disease was found to be decoupled from decisions to act related to illness. Additional information was sought using four criteria grounded in common experience: accessibility, familiarity, complexity, and credibility. These characteristics influenced interactions between lay people and domain experts, such as health care providers, and with technology designed by experts for lay users. Both technical and lay people make decisions with incomplete information and uncertain outcomes. For lay people making decisions about health-related issues, this incomplete knowledge is filled in based on everyday life rather than medical and scientific facts.</description><creator>Cytryn, Kayla N.</creator><contributor>Patel, Vimla L.

Using some of these recent theoretical contributions, this thesis analyzes the influence of institutional conditions on the mobilization of French and immigrant workers in late 19th-century northern France. Two main institutional structures are discussed: France's unique network of labour courts, and the socialist cooperatives created by Flemish workers in the 1880s. The empirical, chiefly archival evidence suggests two main conclusions: labour movements emerged and evolved strongly influenced by the judicial framing of labour relations, which they in turn sought to use and modify to their advantage; the institutional innovation of Flemish immigrant workers had a durable influence on the organization of labour politics in northern France, and contributed to their integration as active social and political participants.</description><creator>Couton, Philippe.</creator><contributor>Hall, John A.

In order to facilitate critical reflection on the preservice teachers' perceptions of teaching, on themselves as teachers, and on their teaching experience, a module comprised of five teacher-films (To Sir With Love, Blackboard Jungle, Stand and Deliver, The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, and SARAFINA!) is designed and employed. The depictions of teaching are deconstructed as a means of introducing the complexity of teaching as well as unveiling the relevance of issues such as class, race, gender, and the politics of power and position to the life of a teacher. Central to the study is exploring how prospective teachers "read" these films and what insights prospective teachers gain from the films. The study generates four main data sources: (1) transcriptions of audio-taped group discussions with the preservice teachers, (2) the preservice teachers' written responses to questionnaires relating to the teacher-films, (3) reflective journals kept by the preservice teachers, and (4) the preservice teachers' written responses to the entire teacher-film module. The analysis of the data is presented in two parts. First, the preservice teachers' overall response to the teacher-film module is detailed. Next, their close reading of teaching and learning as portrayed in two of the films, The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie and SARAFINA!, is discussed. A number of themes that emerge within the data such as the role, influence, and power of teachers are explored. This inquiry has revealed how teacher-films can be utilized within teacher education to prompt neophyte teachers to examine their identity as teachers, to scrutinize their perceptions and assumptions, as well as to stimulate questions with regard to the perplexities of teaching. Film pedagogy also has potential to heighten awareness of vital issues of teaching such as race, class, and gender, to provoke self-study, and prompt social change. In addition, educators and researchers can learn much by examining preservice teachers' responses to popular screen images of teachers as well as other popular culture images of teachers. This information can be used to design teacher education curricula that more adequately prepare neophyte teachers for the challenges of teaching.</description><creator>Butler, Faith J.</creator><contributor>Mitchell, Claudia A.

Contrary to a feminist critique, which denounces the writers' reductive and hence misogynist use of such images, we will remove the anathema momentarily in order to allow a discourse of love to be expressed, in a complex language which reveals the fears and desires of the loving subject in the 19th century. The representation of the woman by Heine and Baudelaire points to a rupture characteristic of modern poetry. In accordance with the principle of irony, in which a strategy of evasion and detachment is employed, the various female characters presented by the two poets can never be reduced to the two-dimensionality of a pure object. The relationship to woman is marked by distance, suffering and dissonance. Occupying a liminal position between life and death, between animate and inanimate, the image of woman exercises a power of seduction which constitutes a challenge to the social order, extended from its margins. The image of the prostitute will be analyzed in terms of its close relationship with the metropolis. Subsequently, Freudian theories will shed light on the stakes of the erotic experience which occurs in contact with the demimondaine. The symbolic exchange established with the commodified body of the prostitute ends in the transmission of illness, and ultimately, in the woman's death. In a vain attempt to control his fear of death, the modern poet displaces this fear onto an object as other: the female cadaver, whose horrible beauty emits a "disturbing uncanniness". The object of desire, put to death in this manner, returns to haunt the fetishist, even to take vengeance in the form of the vampire woman whose body resists death, but breathes it into the one she seduces. Finally, through the images of the statue and the sphinx, the poets reveal a divine and revolutionary dimension in the realm of love.</description><creator>Boyer, Sophie.</creator><contributor>Peters, Paul (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Heine, Heinrich, 1797-1856 -- Characters -- Women.</subject><subject>Women in literature.</subject><subject>Baudelaire, Charles, 1821-1867 -- Characters -- Women.</subject><title>Les representations de la femme chez Heine et Baudelaire : pour une etude du langage moderne de l'amour</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pr76f520h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0r9675307</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of German Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:fb494b13m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:38:59Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Decomposition and N dynamics of grain-corn residues were investigated in a field study in southwestern Quebec, with particular reference to the roles of different plant parts (stems, leaves etc.) in determining overall residue mass loss and N content. A litterbag study was conducted, with surface and buried placements in plots under three tillage systems (no-till, reduced tillage, and conventional tillage, established five years before litterbag placement). Residue mass loss and N content were monitored over a two-year period. Separate data were obtained for leaves, stems, husks, and cobs. Net values for all residues combined were calculated taking into account initial proportions of each plant part at harvest. Overall estimates were made based on residue depth-distribution typical of each tillage system. A spreadsheet-based model of surface residue mass loss was developed, incorporating litterbag mass and other surface-residue data, in order to determine how well litterbag results predicted surface residue mass loss in the field, and to test alternative assumptions regarding residue decomposition and/or burial. Buried residues lost mass more quickly than surface residues, as expected. Thus residue breakdown would be fastest in a conventional system, slowest under no-till, and intermediate with reduced tillage. Substantial decreases in mass and residue N content occurred between fall placement and first sampling in spring, despite low temperatures for much of this period. Mass loss in the first period was substantial for stems as we as husks and leaves. Cobs decomposed most slowly throughout. Nitrogen dynamics, including effects of depth on residue N content, differed greatly by residue type. All the lower-N residues (cobs, husks, stems) immobilized N at some point. However, during the two-year study, N immobilization by one or more residue types was always counterbalanced or exceeded by N release by other residue, at least for the sampling intervals included.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to search for simple, safe, effective, and affordable treatments. Imiquimod is an immune-response modifying agent. Recently, 5% imiquimod cream (Aldara(TM)) received approval by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States and is currently available for the treatment of external genital and perianal warts caused by human papillomavirus infection. The antiviral activity of this drug is mediated through stimulation of cytokine release from many cell types including macrophages resulting in a local immune response at the site of application. Moreover, imiquimod has been shown to enhance cell-mediated immune responses (CMIR). Since imiquimod activates macrophages, the exclusive host cells of Leishmania, and stimulates CMIR which are required for host defence against Leishmania, we have investigated the potential of using imiquimod and its related compound, S-28463, as agents for treating leishmaniasis. It is demonstrated within that imiquimod and S-28463 effectively stimulated leishmanicidal activity both in vitro in macrophages and in vivo in a mouse model. These compounds also stimulated signal transduction associated with the induction of nitric oxide synthesis in macrophages. Imiquimod and S-28463 induced leishmanicidal activity in macrophages in the absence of any other cell types. We have demonstrated that S-28463 generated macrophage leishmanicidal activity by inducing genes involved in macrophage activation and inflammatory responses. Finally, we have also performed an analysis on the influence of L. donovani on macrophage gene expression using a cDNA array analysis, a similar methodology to study the effect of S-28463 on macrophage gene expression.

Cells have acquired a quality control mechanism to ensure proper folding and assembly of proteins. Misfolded and unassembled proteins are recognized by the quality control machinery at the ER and are retained and subsequently targeted for degradation. Calnexin has been identified as one of the major constituents of the ER quality control machinery. Calnexin is a type I phosphoprotein of the ER membrane. The luminal domain of calnexin displays a lectin-like molecular chaperone activity that interacts transiently with nascent glycoproteins and promotes their efficient and productive folding. The cytosolic domain of calnexin is phosphorylated. A prolonged association of a secretion impaired alpha 1-antitrypsin mutant with phosphorylated calnexin has been observed. Phosphorylation of calnexin was also suggested to regulate the rate of protein transport out of the ER. Furthermore, a prolonged association of newly synthesized MHC class 1 heavy chains with calnexin was found in a B lymphoblastoid cell line transfected with HLA-B701 after incubation with the phosphatase inhibitor, cantharidin or okadaic acid. Hence, phosphorylation on the cytosolic domain of calnexin may provide a potential to communicate and regulate its intralumenal lectin-binding domain. In this study, we have identified the in vivo phosphorylation sites of calnexin in both cultured mammalian cells and the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe. By mass spectral analyses, mammalian calnexin is in vivo phosphorylated on three invariant serine residues, two phosphorylation sites are within CK2 recognition motifs and one is within a protein kinase C and/or proline-directed kinase (PDK) phosphorylation motif. By site-directed mutagenesis study, S. pombe calnexin is in vivo serine phosphorylated within a PDK phosphorylation motif. We have also identified ERK-1 as a candidate kinase for mammalian calnexin phosphorylation. Furthermore, we have examined the significance of mammalian calnexin phosphorylation in vitro employing isolated canine pancreatic microsomes. We showed that calnexin interacts with ribosomes and the interaction is regulated by the calnexin phosphorylation. ERK-1 phosphorylated calnexin was shown to exert an enhanced interaction between calnexin and ribosomes. Hence, calnexin phosphorylation may increase the concentration of calnexin in the proximity of translocon and facilitate the translocation and folding of glycoproteins.</description><creator>Wong, Hetty Ngan-Ha, 1969-</creator><contributor>Bergeron, John J.

These compounds are products of arachidonic acid metabolism by the cyclooxygenase pathway. Prostanoids mediate various physiological and pathophysiological effects through their interaction with membrane-bound receptors. In this research, a thorough characterization of the recombinant human (h) PGD2 receptor (DP) was performed, with respect to its radioligand binding and signal transduction properties using prostanoids and prostanoid analogues. The recombinant hDP receptor was then used along with other recombinant human prostanoid receptors to identify a novel specific agonist, L-644,698. This compound exhibits high affinity and potency at the hDP receptor. Moreover. L-644,698 demonstrates at least 300-fold higher selectivity for the hDP receptor than for any of the other seven recombinant human prostanoid receptors tested. Thus. L-644,698 is one of the most selective DP-specific agonists as yet described. Subsequently, the rat (r) DP receptor was cloned and functionally expressed. Pharmacological characterization using L-644,698 and other DP-specific ligands confirmed the identity of this protein as a homologue of human DP, and validated the use of the cDNA corresponding to rDP as a template from which to make rDP-specific riboprobes for in situ hybridization studies. mRNA corresponding to rDP was localized to the CNS and GI tract by the in situ hybridization technique. Within the GI tract. rDP-specific signals were observed repeatedly in the mucous-secreting goblet cells and, less often, in the adjacent epithelium of the stomach, duodenum, ileum, and colon. These observations corroborate prior data demonstrating an abundance of both hDP- and mDP-specific mRNA in G1 tract tissues (especially in small intestine), and suggest a novel biological role for the DP receptor, namely the regulation of mucin secretion.

Field studies investigating Arctic charr-Diphyllobothrium relationships often provide little data from which to fully understand Diphyllobothrium transmission or to assess their impact on copepod or fish hosts. Experimental studies may, therefore, be the only direct way to investigate these issues. The research goal of this thesis was to duplicate the D. dendriticum life cycle in the laboratory to investigate parasite development and host specificity, and to apply the experimental data to natural situations. Results indicated that at 10°C, D. dendriticum eggs develop slowly and 65 days are required for complete embryonation. In many Canadian Arctic lakes water temperatures rarely exceed 4°C, and this study has shown that at this temperature embryonation requires several months, necessitating more than one ice-free season for life cycle completion. The results also showed that embryos developed more rapidly and significantly more eggs hatched when incubated with light or aeration, results that were consistent for D. dendriticum originating from Canada and Norway. To continue the life cycle, coracidia must be consumed by suitable copepod hosts. This study showed that although D. dendriticum will infect the European copepods Cyclops scutifer and Eudiaptomus graciloides, prevalence was higher and procercoids developed more rapidly in E. graciloides. These results showed that E. graciloides is a better host for D. dendriticum than is C. scutifer, contradicting published literature. In North America, E. graciloides is not found in lakes containing D. dendriticum and no North American calanoid species have been tested to determine their host suitability to this cestode. This study identified two North American species, Diaptomus minutus and D. leptopus, which are suitable laboratory hosts. D. minutus is almost certainly a natural host for D. den</description><creator>Wright, M. Elizabeth.</creator><contributor>Curtis, Mark A.

The new trie structures have several distinctive features: (1) they provide significant storage compression by sharing common paths near the root; (2) they are partitioned into pages and are suitable for secondary storage; (3) they are capable of dynamic insertions and deletions of records; (4) they support efficient multidimensional variable-resolution queries by storing the most significant bits near the root. We apply the trie structures to indexing, storing and querying structured data on secondary storage. We are interested in the storage compactness, the I/O efficiency, the order-preserving properties, the general orthogonal range queries and the exact match queries for very large files and databases. We also apply the trie structures to relational joins (set operations). We compare trie structures to various data structures on secondary storage: multipaging and grid files in the direct access method category, R-trees/R*-trees and X-trees in the logarithmic access cost category, as well as some representative join algorithms for performing join operations. Our results show that range queries by trie method are superior to these competitors in search cost when queries return more than a few records and are competitive to direct access methods for exact match queries. Furthermore, as the trie structure compresses data, it is the winner in terms of storage compared to all other methods mentioned above. We also present a new tidy function for order-preserving key-to-address transformation. Our tidy function is easy to construct and cheaper in access time and storage cost compared to its closest competitor.</description><creator>Zhao, Xiaoyan, 1966-</creator><contributor>Merrett, Tim H.

The main reason for this is difficulty in distinguishing the mechanical contributions of the two mechanisms. We used a new non-linear system identification technique to achieve this and address three specific objectives. First, we identified intrinsic and reflex contributions to dynamic ankle stiffness over a wide range of tonic voluntary contraction levels and ankle positions in healthy human subjects (normals). Intrinsic and reflex dynamic stiffness were strongly modulated with operating points; reflex mechanisms made their largest relative contribution to ankle stiffness at low levels of contraction and near the mid-positions. In some cases, reflexes contributed significantly to overall torque indicating that stretch reflexes have a potential to play a significant role in control of posture and movement. Second, we examined the nature and origin of mechanical abnormalities associated with spasticity in chronic spinal cord injured subjects (SCIs). Reflex and intrinsic stiffness were larger in SCIs than normals. The magnitude and relative size of the changes were strongly dependent on joint position and contraction state. Overall joint stiffness was abnormally and significantly high in SCIs and stretch reflexes contributed strongly to it. Third, we explored the effects of long-term FES-assisted walking on intrinsic and reflex dynamic stiffness in SCIs. Both reflex and intrinsic stiffness decreased substantially following long-term (&gt;16 months) FES-assisted walking. The results indicate that this rehabilitation approach may cause spastic joint mechanics to become closer to normal behavior, and consequently could be useful for treatment as well as restoring function.</description><creator>Mirbagheri, M.

The Rescorla-Wagner model and causal model theory account for blocking through different mechanisms. To examine the predictions from these two models, seven experiments tested the extent to which "causal scenario" and "causal order" would influence whether blocking was observed in human contingency learning tasks. "Causal scenario" was manipulated by contrasting responses to two causes of one effect or to one cause of two effects; "causal order" was defined as causes preceding effects or effects preceding causes. The four conjunctions of these two factors were investigated separately in Experiments 1 to 5. In Experiments 1 and 2, two causes preceded one effect and two effects preceded one cause, respectively. Blocking was observed regardless of whether the predictors were causes or effects. In Experiments 3, 4 and 5, participants were presented with one antecedent cue and made separate predictions about each of the trial's two outcomes. Blocking was not observed, irrespective of whether the antecedent cue was a cause or an effect. These initial results were consistent with the Rescorla-Wagner model. An alternative explanation was that blocking failed to occur in Experiments 3 to 5 because participants were asked questions between the predictor and two outcomes. Predicting the outcomes might have implicitly led participants to monitor them separately and to report on subsets of the data at the time of judgment. To address this issue, the volunteers in Experiment 6 observed the events on each trial but did not make any predictions about the outcomes. Blocking was observed, signifying that the intervening questions between the antecedent and consequent cues constitute an important variable influencing cue competition effects. In Experiment 7, all four conjunctions of causal scenario and causal order were tested simultaneously. Furthermore, participants w</description><creator>Mehta, Rick R.</creator><contributor>Baker, A.

AM development of maize genotypes and uptake of nutrients as influenced by soil P levels were studied. Several experiments were conducted both in the greenhouse and in the field. In greenhouse trials, pasteurized substrates were inoculated with Glomus intraradices as mycorrhizal treatments. Mycorrhizal development varied widely among maize hybrids and inbreds. Leafy normal stature (LNS) had the highest root colonization and shoot:root ratio and was the most responsive to AM fungi. Mycorrhizal development was generally reduced at high soil P and micronutrient levels. The percentage of root colonization was correlated with the ratio of plant tissue N/P only when soil N level was intermediate. Mycorrhizal plants increased uptake of Zn and Cu only at low P and low micronutrient levels, but decreased Mn uptake at higher micronutrient level. In field trials, soil fumigation was used to eliminate AM fungi in control plots. Again LNS was most responsive to indigenous AM fungi, closely followed by Non-leafy normal stature (NLNS). Mycorrhizae increased uptake of K, Ca and Mg only when these nutrients and available P were low in soil. Correlations between extraradicular hyphae and plant concentrations of K, Ca and Mg suggested that uptake of K was more dependent on extraradicular hyphae than uptake of Ca and Mg. Total P uptake was higher in plots where the AM symbiosis was not repressed, but soil available P was not always reduced. There is potential for development of mycorrhiza efficient maize hybrids performing well under low input management in sustainable agriculture.</description><creator>Liu, Aiguo, 1949-</creator><contributor>Hamel, Chantal (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Soils -- Phosphorus content.</subject><subject>Mycorrhizal fungi.</subject><subject>Corn -- Breeding.</subject><title>Mycorrhizal symbiosis and nutrient uptake in new maize hybrids with contrasting phenotypes as influenced by soil phosphorus level</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ng451k258.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sf268682t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Natural Resource Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6d56zz221</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:39:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Let F be a global function field of characteristic p, infinity a fixed place of F. The analytic uniformization of elliptic curves in characteristic p by means of Drinfeld modular curves is used to associate to an elliptic curve E over F with split multiplicative reduction at infinity a measure muE on P1Finfinity . By choosing an appropriate embedding of a quadratic extension K/F into the matrix algebra M 2(F), the measure muE is pushed forward to a measure on the p-adic group G, isomorphic to an anticyclotomic Galois group over the Hilbert class field of K. It is proven that integration of this measure yields the L -invariant of E at infinity , when infinity is split in K, and a Heegner point in E if infinity is inert. An interpretation of these results in terms of special values of L-functions is suggested.</description><creator>Longhi, Ignazio.</creator><contributor>Darmon, Henri (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Mathematics.</subject><title>Non-archimedean integration and special values of L-functions for elliptic curves over function fields</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5x21th114.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6d56zz221</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z029p636g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:39:03Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Personal communication services (PCS) is one of the fastest growing sectors in telecommunications. PCS can be provided by wireless cellular communication systems, that operate in radio environments characterized as multipath fading channels. This thesis addresses the subject of signal detection and performance analysis over multipath Ricean/Rayleigh fading channels, when the multipath delays are known and the path resolvability assumption is not satisfied. The path resolvability condition asserts that the signal autocorrelation function vanishes ("strict") or it is small ("approximate") at inter-path delays. The strict path resolvability assumption is rarely satisfied, and even the approximate path resolvability condition is not always satisfied in practice. For example, the approximate path resolvability is not satisfied for narrow-band systems such as GSM, IS136, or their third generation derivatives and it is neither satisfied for wide-band systems, such as IS95 or W-CDMA, in indoors due to the relatively small multipath delays of these environments. Existing demodulation schemes for multipath fading channels, such as Rake receivers, provide diversity gains but they are based on the path resolvability assumption. This thesis shows the severe limitations of the classical Rake receiver over unresolved multipath fading channels, and generalizes the Rake concept to improve performance. The optimal receiver that assumes knowledge of the specular component (specular coherent), and the optimal scheme that assumes knowledge of the specular component magnitudes only (non-coherent), are derived for unresolved Ricean multipath fading channels. It is shown that both include an orthogonalization (or decorrelation) stage that vanishes when the multipath is resolved. This thesis presents explicit forms of the Minimum Mean-Square Error estimator of the likelihood ratio estimator-correlator forms, and shows that the decorrelation operation is present in the estimation process. Based on the insight provided by these optimal schemes, suboptimal receivers more suitable for implementation are proposed. Performance analysis results, for several binary modulation formats, demonstrate the importance of the decorrelation operation in yielding diversity gains and eliminating error floors under multipath unresolvability conditions. It is also shown that the knowledge of the specular component phase does not provide significant gains at high SNR for orthogonal FSK. Finally, it is shown that SNR gains can be obtained by exploiting the knowledge of the specular component magnitude.</description><creator>Danilo, Florence A.</creator><contributor>Leib, Harry (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Detection techniques and performance analysis for fading multipath channels with unresolved components</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s4655j27z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z029p636g</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mw22v713q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:39:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The development of non-amino acid routes for the construction of peptides remains a challenge. The main goal of this study is to develop a new transition metal-mediated route to synthesize alpha-amino acid and peptide derivatives from imines and carbon monoxide. The proposed approach requires the sequential insertion of CO and imine into late transition metal sigma-bonds. In Chapters 2 and 3, the ability of the palladium complex L2Pd(CH 3)N(R)=C(H)R'+ X- [L2 = chelating nitrogen ligands, X- = non-coordinating counteranion] to mediate the insertion of imines is examined. While L 2Pd(CH3)N(R)=C(H)R'+ X- is inert towards imine insertion into a palladium-methyl bond, the addition of CO to L2Pd(CH3)N(R)=C(H)R '+ X- yields the palladium-acyl complex L2Pd(COCH3)N(R)=C(H)R' +X-, which subsequently reacts to form the novel product of imine insertion: (L2)Pd[eta2-CH(R ')NRCOCH3]+X-. This demonstrates that these palladium complexes can undergo the novel sequential insertion of carbon monoxide and imine into the palladium-carbon bond in a manner directly analogous to that observed in olefin/CO alternating co-polymerizations. Examination of the mechanism of imine insertion (Chapter 3) demonstrates that, unlike olefins, imines undergo a concerted migration from the sigma-imine complex to form the product of imine insertion. The X-ray structure of the insertion complex 2.6b suggests the unique combination of amide bond formation, carbonyl oxygen chelation, and resonance stabilization of the chelate ring provides the stabilization required for this reaction to occur. The product of CO/imine insertion is found to be inert towards reaction with carbon monoxide (Chapter 4). However, the addition of CO to its chloride analogue, generated via the oxidative addition of N-acyl iminium salts Tol(H)C=N(CH 2Ph)COPh+Cl- to Pd2(dba) 3•CHCl3 in the presence of 2,2'-bipyridine, results in the formation of 2-imidazolinecarboxylate derivatives (Chapter 5). Mechanistic studies reveal that imidazoline formation occurs via CO insertion into Pd--C bond of (bipy)Pd[eta2-CH(R' )NRCOR′]+Cl-, generating a palladium-bound alpha-amino acid derivative, which is followed by coupling with imine. This reaction is extended into a novel one pot palladium-catalyzed coupling of imine, carbon monoxide and acid chloride into 2-imidazolinecarboxylate derivatives. The described methodology provides a facile route to access the biologically relevant imidazoline derivatives through the sequential insertion of CO and imine into palladium-alkyl bonds.</description><creator>Dghaym, Rania.</creator><contributor>Arndtsen, Bruce (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Chemistry, Inorganic.</subject><title>The novel sequential insertion of carbon monoxide and imines into palladium-carbon [sigma]-bonds : synthesis, mechanism and reactivity</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rn301296s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/mw22v713q</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pg15bg73k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:39:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Over-expression of either P-gp1 and/or MRP1 in tumor cell lines confers resistance to structurally diverse anti-cancer drugs. Although the role of these two proteins in clinical drug resistance remains to be confirmed, the use of Pgp1-specific inhibitors in combination with standard anti-cancer drugs have demonstrated significant improvement in clinical response. However, evidence exists that reversal of P-gp1 alone is not sufficient. Therefore, while no drugs are currently available that can efficiently reverse MRP1 drug efflux in tumor cells, there is an urgent need to develop MRP1-specific blockers. In an effort to gain a better understanding of MRP1-drug interactions and to identify sequences within MRP1 that interact directly with drugs, we developed two structurally diverse photosensitive drug analogues, a quinoline-based compound (IACI) and a xanthone-derivative (IAARh123). Both compounds photolabeled MRP1 and showed a direct and specific interaction with the protein at physiologically relevant sites. Initial mapping of photolabeled sequences in MRP1 (Chapters 2 and 3), identified multiple IACI- or IAARh123-photolabeled peptides (~4--7 kDa) derived from both the N-terminal (MSD0+MSD1+NBD 1) and C-terminal (MSD2+NBD2) domains of MRP1. A subsequent study (Chapter 4), using MRP1 variants with hemagglutinin (HA) epitopes inserted at eight different locations, led to a higher resolution mapping of the previously identified IACI- or IAARh123-labeled peptides. Specifically, two photolabeled peptides (~6--7 kDa), derived from variants with insertions at positions 574 and 1222, were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA monoclonal antibody. Based on the location of the HA epitopes in the latter variants together with molecular masses of the two peptides, the photolabeled amino acid residues were localized to MRP1 sequences encoding transmembranes 10 and 11 of MSD1 and transmembranes 16 and 17 of MSD 2. Interestingly, the same sequences were photolabeled with both</description><creator>Daoud, Roni N.</creator><contributor>Georges, Elias (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Multidrug resistance.</subject><subject>CD antigens.</subject><subject>Cancer -- Chemotherapy.</subject><title>A study of MRP1-drug interactions : identification of the drug binding site(s)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k06989159.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pg15bg73k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Parasitology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xw42n9600</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:39:04Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Bistatic Doppler radar networks have become in the last five years a viable and inexpensive alternative to multiple-Doppler networks. Operational experience with a bistatic network at McGill University showed many cases in which data quality seemed heavily affected. Study of those situations suggested sidelobe contamination from the transmitter antenna pattern to be the principal cause. To confirm these findings a sidelobe simulation model (SISI model) was constructed. Comparison between simulations and actual data showed a good reproduction of the observed effect. It is also shown that this effect may have damaging consequences in Doppler fields in both convective and stratiform precipitation events. An index of contamination that can be obtained either with the SISI model or directly using the reflectivity bistatic data is introduced to detect areas of low quality data. Recommendations for the effective use of bistatic data are presented. These findings are taken into account when the optimization of the layout of a bistatic network is analyzed. Sidelobe contamination was found to be a serious problem irrespective of the receiver's location. More than one passive receiver increases the extent of the dual Doppler area but unfortunately does not significantly reduce the problem of sidelobe contamination within a predetermined area. A rule-of-thumb for the deployment of a bistatic network is presented. Some suggestions for improvements of the network are given.</description><creator>De Elía, Ramón.</creator><contributor>Zawadzki, Isztar (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</subject><title>Performance study of a bistatic radar network</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7p88cj275.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xw42n9600</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:xg94hr421</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:39:05Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is about an investigation of how children with philosophical experience use philosophical discussion as a way of doing research. A Lawrence Stenhouse description of 'research' as "systematic and sustained enquiry made public" (Bridges 1996, p. 2) served as my starting point for what to count as 'research'. As an interpretive case story of children participating in research as co-researchers, this research is about how I engaged in an after-school Discussion Research Group co-research project with seventeen volunteer students from my Philosophy for Children classes. Our co-research was a methodological experiment in merging genres of research (Anderson, 1989) in which we adapted and combined Philosophy for Children and qualitative research techniques in a philosophical exploration of philosophical discussion. Bringing together the children's philosophical expertise and my interest in the use of qualitative research methodologies, I explored how and whether 'to do philosophy' is 'to do research'. Using an open and systematic inquiry approach, I answer the dissertation research question in three ways: by demonstration, by surfacing philosophical inquiry research acts and by conceptual investigation. In a set of co-researching stories, I use document and verbatim transcribed data obtained from audio and video tapes of forty-eight co-research sessions to demonstrate the co-researcher children at work using their own voices. Using these data I surface philosophical inquiry research acts by identifying philosophical inquiry 'moves' the children use in the research context. And I present a conceptual investigation of research roles as a way of answering how the philosophical work the children co-researchers do can be seen as 'doing research'. This investigation offers a textured portrayal of children using philosophical discussion as a way of doing research. It presents their work as a complex and comprehensive account of 'philosophical discussion'. It uses children's verbatim data to surface the philosophical in research thereby supporting my assertion that to do philosophy is to do research. It presents a conceptual refinement of a variety of research roles. And it presents a viable example of how philosophical and qualitative research methodologies can work together for mutual benefit.</description><creator>Kyle, Judy A.</creator><contributor>Jackson, Nancy (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Children and philosophy.</subject><subject>Philosophy -- Study and teaching (Elementary)</subject><title>Investigating philosophical discussion with children as co-researchers : a case story of doing educative research using collaborative philosophical inquiry</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c821gm568.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xg94hr421</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):33425</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
