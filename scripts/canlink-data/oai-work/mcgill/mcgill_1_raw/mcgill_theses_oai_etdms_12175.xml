In addition to the well-known corticopetal system of fibers there is a corticofugal system which projects back to the thalamus. The corticopetal system consists of the group of specific thalamocortical projections described in Walker’s monograph (1938), together with the diffuse projections to the cortex of the thalamic reticular system recently discussed by Jasper (1949b). The parallel but less precise system of fibers, the corticothalamic pathways,has been mentioned by many investigators since von Monakow (1895) first suggested that fibers from the cerebral cortex terminate in the nuclei of the thalamus. It is with this latter group of fibers that the present study is concerned. Discussing the immediate problems of the anatomy of the thalamus, Le Gros Clark (1949) remarks that "the extent and importance of descending corticothalamic connections have yet to be accurately defined. In the past, considerable stress has been laid on such connections as a basis for the cortical control of thalamic activities — whether in an inhibitory role or as a part of a mechanism for sensory attention".

Owing to the inaccessibility of the interior, it was not until the last few years of the past century that anyone had entered the country with the express purpose of studying its geology. However, during the last decade the added strategic importance of the country, along with the exploitation of the vast deposits of rich iron ore, have led to more rapid opening up of the hinterland of Labrador. For many years it has been thought that the Ungava peninsula harboured the centre of the great Labrador ice sheet that swept out from this area to bury many thousands of square miles under great thicknesses of ice. Unfortunately owing to its inaccessibility, glacial features have been studied in only a few isolated areas, and the knowledge gained has been fragmentary. Thus nearly all the data concerning the Pleistocene history has been gained from southern Canada and the northern United States. This drawback was in part overcome when the R.C.A.F. took aerial photographs of a large proportion of the territory. While these photographs do not eliminate the need for field observations, they greatly facilitate the work and permit large areas to be studied in a very short time.</description><creator>Syme, Andrew MacAlister.</creator><contributor>Gill, J.

Although the principle of convalescence has been practiced for hundreds of years, its definition has taken time to evolve. Dr. Woodruff^1 has formulated the following: "According to the Oxford dictionary the word convalescence, in its present medical meaning, did not come into use until the 19th century. Before that a person was ‘sick’ or he was ‘well.’ Now, convalescence is recognized as a state of gradual recovery from illness. In other words, the term convalescence is applied to the transitory condition when a person is neither wholly sick nor wholly well; and it is just that understanding of the convalescent state which makes the care that a patient receives during this period such a factor in determining whether he goes forth into life well and sound and able to meet its stresses and strains, or undermined, with lowered resistance and more likely to succumb to some disease of either physical or psychic origin." Elizabeth Gardner in her book on "The Road to Recovery from Illness" has also quoted the definition formulated by Doctors C.C.Lund and James A. Halstad which includes the following salient points^2: "Convalescence is a period of recovery after a period of disease. Disease includes fatigue in all its aspects, psychoneurosis and other mental states. Convalescence also includes periods of partial recovery between operative procedures [...]</description><creator>Taylor, J. Elizabeth.</creator><contributor>Elledge, C.

In the course of the summer a section of the coast and the coastal islands between Domino Run and Hamilton Inlet were studied. Here the Labrador coast, which is relatively unexplored, was found to consist mainly of a grey granite gneiss which had been intruded by basic rocks of at least two ages. The older of the intrusive rocks are garnet-bearing and have since been found to contain well-developed reaction rims. Parts of the garnetiferous gabbro-diabase, which is the older intrusive occur as inclusions in the gneiss and the inclusions have been metamorphosed. The younger intrusives have not been altered like the older locks. The character and the origin of the garnet in the gabbro-diabase as well as a detailed description of the main rock types is proposed.

In electroplating, articles are coated with a layer of metal for the purpose of ornament or protection.  The physical form of the deposit is of prime importance since upon it depend such properties as lustre, hardness and ductility. Good adherence of the deposit to the plated article is also a requisite. The process of electroforming is the production or reproduction of articles by electrodeposition.  Reproduction of printing plates and phonograph matrices are common examples of electroforming.  In electrorefining, the anodes consist principally of the metal to be refined. The purpose is to convert an impure into a pure metal as, for example, with copper.  Except for marked roughness which may cause short circuits and thus lower current efficiency the structure and physical properties of deposits are of minor importance.  The process of electrowinning employs insoluble anodes in a solution derived by leaching ores. The purpose is to recover a pure metal from a solution which usually contains other metals. As in electrorefining, the physical structure of the deposit is of small importance since the metal in both cases is usually re-cast from a melt before use. Also, since the deposit is stripped from the cathode starting sheet, the adhesion in both cases must be of a limited degree.[...]</description><creator>Thomas, Gordon.</creator><contributor>Winkler, C.

There are several aspects to this relatively young science and each has contributed to this increasing interest. Among the more important aspects are the following: a) symbiotic relationships between insects and microorganisms, b) human, animal, and plant diseases carried by insects, c) epizootic diseases among insect populations. The control of destructive insects through the agency of microorganisms has been a rather controversial subject since the beginning of the century. Several workers have noticed the spectacular effects of naturally occurring epizootics and have tried to duplicate the results by artificial distribution of pathogens. Many of these early experiments were unsuccessful. In such cases the failures were often due to a lack of understanding of the many factors which affect the course of such an epizootic. During the past two decades a number of successful attempts at microbial control have illustrated the value of preliminary fundamental research.[...]</description><creator>Thomson, Hugh MacIntosh.</creator><contributor>Gray, P.

In a previous thesis the author has reviewed the social and medical history of epilepsy and summarized the present state of scientific knowledge about this disease (Tower, 1948). The facts presented therein make it clear that epilepsy is one of the important diseases confronting society and the medical profession and demanding a solution. The present state of world conditions underlines this demand, since war carries with it an inevitable aftermath of increase in epileptic patients. But the problem encompasses an even greater scope than the disease itself.  Epilepsy gives promise of peculiar suitability to investigations into the mechanisms of nervous system function. The common denominator of most forms of epilepsy and certain other conditions, the generalized seizure, is a potentiality of the normal brain. And the clinical manifestations of the epileptic attack touch upon most, if not all, of the known potentialities of neuronal function from the complexities of thought, dreams and memories, through automatic and reflex activity, to basic crude movements and sensations. One may think of epilepsy as representing an exaggeration or caricature of the normal functioning of the nervous system. [...]</description><creator>Tower, Donald B.</creator><contributor>Elliott, K.

It is based on the natural affinities of plants- and has been guided by the concepts of evolution. The tools of the taxonomist have been mainly morphology, anatomy, embryology and palaeontology. However, in many cases it has been impossible to construct accurate phylogenetic relationships.  It becomes important, therefore, to discover additional means whereby some of the problems of taxonomy may be resolved. As Gibbs (33) and others have pointed out, the comparative chemistry of plants provides another source of evidence for the determination of their relationships and it has been shown, in a number of cases, that there is a correlation between certain aspects of the chemistry of plants and their arrangement in a natural system based on morphological or other studies.  In 1944, Creighton, Gibbs and Hibbert (20) found that there are significant differences between the lignins of some of the major groups of vascular plants. Their conclusions were based on the recovery of certain phenolic aldehydes from alkaline nitrobenzene oxidised lignins. Thus, the Angiosperms and the Gnetales gave syringaldehyde and vanillin on oxidation, whilst the Coniferales, with few exceptions, Ginkgo biloba and the ferns gave only vanillin.

The work was originally planned to include Ontario as well but since J. Tuzo Wilson undertook the compilation of the structure north of the 45°30’ parallel  (with far better means than the writer had at its disposition such as aerial photographs, drauftsmen and secretaries)  the part of Ontario that is compiled lies south of this parallel.  The arrangement of the written material was done along the following main topics.  a) Folding.  b) Flowage.  c) Faulting as to folding.  d) Faulting.  As one can see the author tried to respect a theoretical time scale and the topics are classified according to such. However some of the features did overlap over one another and they are not exactly true to that time scale. Two maps (in pocket) were drawn at 8 miles to 1 inch.  One called Map 1 shows a distribution of the geological boundaries, fold axes, faults, and strikes and dips of bedding and shistosity. The other map, called Map 2,  made from the first one shows the trends of structure.  Full lines do indicate trends corresponding to the actual interpreted geological structure while the dotted lines are trends of rivers, lakes, and other physiographic features [...]</description><creator>Tremblay, Mousseau.</creator><contributor>O'Neill, J.

The hydrodynamic theory describing the rotational motion of spherical particles was verified experimentally. Observations were made on the collision mechanism of spherical particles and shown to differ from the postulated mechanisms. Collision frequencies were measured in suspensions of spheres and the values agreed with the calculated values within the experimental error. The rotational motion of rod-shaped particles was examined. The particles were shown to move in an orbit similar to that predicted for ellipsoids by Jeffery. The period of rotation was found to be less than the predicted value. The discrepancy is probably due to the fact that the particles were cylindrical. On extended exposure of the particle to the shear action it was found that the "orbital constant" tended to drift.  There was, however, no tendency for the orbital constant to assume the value predicted by Jeffery’s hypothesis of minimum viscosity. The instantaneous orientation of rod-shaped particles in a suspension were examined for three different axis ratios. Distribution curves were plotted in one plane which showed that the distribution of orbits remained constant over a period of time thus confirming the hypothesis of Eisenschitz.</description><creator>Trevelyan, Benjamin John Levi.</creator><contributor>Maass, O.

Heyrovsky in a series of papers published between 1922 and 1926. The method is based on interpretation of current-potential curves obtained when electroreducible or electro-oxidizable substances are reduced or oxidized at a dropping mercury electrode. The complete cell consists of a dropping mercury electrode, and another electrode which is essentially non-polarizable. The curve obtained by plotting the external voltage applied to the cell against the resulting current is the current-voltage curve,  and since the one electrode is non-polarizable, this curve is actually the current-potential curve of the dropping electrode. Polarographic analysis depends essentially on certain unique characteristics of these current-potential curves. In an electrolytic cell which consists of a flat mercury electrode in combination with an electrode of constant potential, the reaction which takes place at the mercury electrode may be either reduction or oxidation depending on the direction of the current. If the reaction is reduction of metal ions to the corresponding metal, the metal may be soluble or insoluble in the mercury. Only the latter case, that is, the reduction of positive ions to metals soluble in mercury need be considered here. Such a reaction is illustrated by the equation Hg + Mz+ + ze = MHg [...]</description><creator>Turner, Robert Chapman.</creator><contributor>Winkler, C.

Evelyn as part of a long-term study of the natural history of essential hypertension ( 1 ). His general working hypothesis at the commencement of his study was "the concept that the pathogenesis of essential hypertension involves a genetically determined abnormality in the contractile mechanism of arteriolar smooth muscle, rather than a derangement of the neurogenic and humoral factors which regulate this contractility”. The first phase of this study was the investigation of the chemical composition of arteriolar smooth muscle.  Later, it is planned to expand the project to include studies of the metabolism of this tissue as well as physiologic investigations of its contractile properties.</description><creator>Weigensberg, Bernard I.</creator><contributor>Evelyn, K.

This same period has been one of extensive social, industrial and political expansion, all of which is reflected in the changes seen in our educational system. From being almost wholly academic institutions, the schools have gradually evolved a newer concept of what constitutes a well rounded general education. Influenced by the suggestions made by research committees, educational surveys and individual studies, most educationalists have now agreed that the older academic courses must be vitalized and integrated with the other practical, physical and social factors that are now conceived as essential to the educational development of the individual. Practical education courses in organized school programmes are of a relatively recent origin. Their introduction into the schools was not easily accomplished in the face of the more conservative and prejudiced claims of traditionally minded teachers. Like any other new and untried project, the work has had long periods of trial and experimental effort. Experience has proved that the practical education courses should have a very definite place in the common school programmes. Now, their wide acceptance and ever increasing development are vindications of the faith and efforts of the pioneers of this movement.

The study of arteriosclerosis in man, especially during its developmental stages, is beset with difficulties. The study of cholesterol- induced atherosclerosis in the rabbit, which is similar in many respects to the disease in man, offers a method whereby factors promoting, accelerating, modifying or inhibiting the lesions, may be evaluated. The suggestion has been made that various factors, which have been shown in the past to modify or inhibit the development of cholesterol atherosclerosis in the rabbit, do so, at least in part, through the influence of loss of weight. The evaluation of this factor is the subject matter of this thesis.</description><creator>Whiteside, John H.</creator><contributor>Duff, G.

She assumed,that the amino group of glutamic acid was transferred to some reactive carbohydrate residue to form a new amino acid. A similar phenomenon was observed by Banga and Szent- Gyorgyi (8), who noted that the rate of oxalacetic acid disappearance from pigeon breast muscle preparations was increased by glutamic acid. However, they did not recognize this as a transamination reaction. The correctness of Needham’s assumption was demonstrated by Braunstein and Kritzmann (2), when they described the reversible reaction in muscle between glutamic acid and pyruvic acid which proceeds as follows: 1 (+) glutamic + pyruvic →/← αketoglutaric + 1 (+) alanine. The enzyme catalysing the reaction they termed aminopherase. They proved its reversibility by isolating and chemically identifying the alanine and glutamic acid formed. The equilibrium was reached in 20 to 25 minutes under their conditions. In a later study (3) they found the enzyme was not limited to skeletal muscle but was present, also, in heart muscle, brain, liver and kidney [...]</description><creator>Witty, Ralph.</creator><contributor>Quastel, J.

Il va chez les trois ours. Sans beaucoup attendre, il se dit: Voyons, je meurs de faim! Mais la bouillie du père ours s’est refroidie; et la bouillie de la mère ourse est trop cuite. Quant à la bouillie de l’ourson...et ici le conte déraille... elle ne suffit pas; ou elle a disparu: elle s’est figée, ou elle lui soulève le coeur. Notre pauvre Goldilocks se trouve dans l’obligation de chercher un autre bol de bouillie, recherche, hélas, qui prend vite les proportions d’une manie. Et comme ce Goldilocks, Huysmans se promène â travers les pages de ses romans en quête d’une bouillie cuite â point, en quête d’un restaurant propre, en quête d’une cuisine qui ne sente pas la gargote. Enfin, désespéré, il tente d’apprêter lui-même ses repas; et Huysmans et son lecteur s’endorment, un livre de cuisine à la main. A ceux qui demanderaient: “Pourquoi cette constante recherche d’un restaurant avenant, d’une assiette propre, d’une nappe non souillée dans les romans de Huysmans?” nous répondrons: pour le plaisir de la quête.

Malfunctioning of one or more of the endocrine mechanisms may result in profound disturbances in or even death to an animal. Administration of crystalline hormones or extracts of these highly active substances elicits effects which have been carefully determined. Such physiological responses are more or less transitory in nature tending to demonstrate that the hormones are rapidly transformed to inactive substances. Because of their marked physiological actions, a large volume of work has been done to clarify the metabolic changes suffered by the steroids. Much of this information on the metabolism of the steroid hormones has been obtained by injection of known amounts of crystalline hormones, and isolation of the steroids which subsequently appeared in the urine. From evidence gained on examination of the products excreted, it is clear that the amount of metabolites recoverable from the excreta is but a small fraction of the expected value. Generally speaking, most of the administered hormone is unaccounted for when the excreta is examined by conventional procedures involving chemical isolation, colorimetric determination, or biological assay. From this fact there has arisen the problem of explaining the fate of most of the exogenous hormone and conceivably this fate would be similar [...]</description><creator>Yates, Claire H.</creator><contributor>Heard, R.

Many writers have investigated the problem from a theoretical standpoint, but very little has been done in the way of measuring these losses experimentally. At low frequencies radiation losses are negligible, but they become appreciable at high frequencies thus affecting the design of parallel-wire lines for use in the higher portion of the frequency spectrum. In order that the controversy may be wholly or at least partially settled, and to correct existing data, this treatise has therefore been prepared. This paper describes the measurement of radiation resistance from resonant parallel-wire lines in the frequency range 300 Mc/sec. to 1200 Mc/sec. To determine the dependence of radiation losses on line length, lines varying in length from one-quarter wavelength to four wavelengths, with open and short-circuited terminations have been investigated. The results obtained agree with theory in some ways whereas they disagree in others. Radiation losses are similar in some respects to ohmic losses and as such are undesirable in many engineering applications. Methods of decreasing these losses have been devised, and the amount by which these methods remedy the losses is determined. If it ever becomes necessary to increase the radiation losses, the methods by which this may be attained also are investigated.[...]</description><creator>Yurko, Michael.</creator><contributor>Chipman, R.

The more recent investigations relating to the hormones of the adrenal cortex, which have led to the use of synthetic steroids in the treatment of diseases of mal-adaptation, represent a crowning achievement of the co-operation of the biological and chemical sciences. Yet, these remarkable discoveries should not, in any way, obscure the enormous gaps in our knowledge of the metabolism of these substances, but should instead pave the way to a thorough study of the many problems that remain to be solved. Many factors have been responsible for the great difficulties encountered during the study of the intermediary metabolism of the steroids. The complicated chemical structure of the molecules and the presence of only minute quantities of the hormones in biological materials account for some of these obstacles; the occurrence of a large number of closely related compounds in the same tissues, organs and excreta as well as their rapid synthesis and degradation account for others. In practice, these difficulties were clearly demonstrated by the fact that only a small fraction of an administered dose of a steroid could be recovered from the experimental animal and its excretory products. Thus little reliable and coherent information regarding the biochemical transformations of these substances could be gained prior to the use of isotopes.

Its melting point is 147.5 - 148.5°C. The established system of designating the rings by letter and the numbering of individual carbon atoms accompany the structure at this time. Hereafter, the location of various positions by number may be made by reference to this formula. The parent hydrocarbon, cholestane, may be derived by completely saturating cholesterol with hydrogen. This provides us with a basis of naming members of this series. Thus, cholesterol would be completely identified by Δ^5-cholesten-3 (β)-ol, where the Δ signifies a double bond and the superscript its position in the molecule. The symbols α and β refer to the orientation of substituents attached to the nucleus. Those bearing the symbol β are visualized as projecting above the plane of the paper and are shown by a solid line for the bond. α-oriented substituents are regarded as lying below the plane of the paper and are indicated by a dotted line for the bond. Cholesterol belongs to a class of organic compounds called sterols, which are crystalline alcohols(Gr. stereos, solid) and which are isolated from the unsaponifiable residues of lipids derived from animals and plants1. In recent years, this classification has been extended to include a great many other compounds, all having the same characteristic ring system, but differing in the side chain [...]</description><creator>Zorbach, W.

To brace the development of these two factors is more than describing a panorama of bricks, steel, and asphalt against a background of dates and statistics. In any large community a heritage arises from the interplay of ethnic and religious forces with the cultural approaches to the environment. The forms that this heritage takes in early communal life are expressed in the urban environment in visual and less tangible structures which have evolved from the interplay of this heritage with outside factors. The objective of this thesis is to record this evolution in a selected area of Quebec in the hope that it will provide some clue as to the nature of the conflicts that arise within the modern urban community. In a joint thesis submitted last April to the Geography Department, two fellow students associated with the community planning group at the University dealt with the evolution of settlement and the development of land use, within the Richelieu valley. The present thesis may be regarded as written in association with their work.
