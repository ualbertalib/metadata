Electrical, contractile and structural remodeling are important synergistic contributors to the AF substrate. Fibrosis is a hallmark of arrhythmogenic structural remodeling and occurs as a convergent pathological end-point in a variety of settings. The consequences and determinants of fibrotic structural remodeling are presently poorly understood. The overall purpose of these studies was to gain insights into the mechanisms governing the development and consequences of fibrosis, as well as the potential therapeutic value of fibrosis-targeting interventions. We have shown previously that structural remodeling in experimental congestive heart failure (CHF) is quantitatively different (~20-fold greater) in atria compared to ventricles. To better understand the regional differences in fibrotic remodeling, we examined the hypothesis that there exist intrinsic differences between atrial and ventricular fibroblasts. Despite phenotypic similarity, cultured atrial fibroblasts were found to be consistently more reactive than ventricular, showing distinct growth characteristics, proliferative responses, and gene-expression profiles. PDGF-related differences played an important role in atrial-ventricular proliferative response discrepancies, and appear to be similarly implicated in vivo. Atrial fibrosis commonly accompanies AF, but whether the fibrosis is a cause of AF or can be caused by rapid atrial activation is unclear. We therefore addressed the hypothesis that rapid-pacing of cardiomyocytes can influence fibroblast proliferation and secretory functions in a paracrine fashion. Cultured fibroblasts were incubated with the conditioned medium from tachypaced atrial cardiomyocytes. Tachypacing-conditioned medium induced differentiation to an activated secretory myofibroblast phenotype. Fibrosis-related genes were similarly increased in a clinically-relevant experimental model of atrial-tachypacing (ATP)-induced AF, providing evidence for consequences of this potential paracrine mechanism. It is unclear precisely how fibrosis interferes with conduction. Myocardial electrical continuity is maintained by specialized gap junction proteins connexin43 (Cx43) and connexin40 (Cx40), and changes in connexin expression, phosphorylation and localization are thought to correlate with the onset of fibrosis and pro-arrhythmic conduction slowing. We sought to determine the relative contributions of fibrosis and connexin changes to the AF substrate during the development and reversal of experimental CHF. Atrial fibrous tissue content was found to be increased in CHF without reversal, correlating with the persistence of conduction abnormalities and prolonged AF duration in the recovery period. CHF did not produce significant changes in atrial Cx43 and Cx40 localization or mRNA and protein expression. Cx43 was however, hypo-phosphorylated in CHF with complete reversal during recovery, suggesting that fibrosis over connexin changes is the primary contributor to AF maintenance in experimental CHF. Finally, we undertook studies to determine if fibrosis can be attenuated pharmacologically in two in vivo models of structural remodeling. Numerous studies have described cardioprotective effects of resveratrol (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic), thus providing a strong rationale to hypothesize that resveratrol administration would ameliorate the progression of remodeling and loss of contractility which results from myocardial infarction (MI). Serial echocardiography and dobutamine stress testing revealed that resveratrol did not improve cardiac remodeling or global hemodynamic function up to 12 weeks post-MI, but did preserve cardiac contractile reserve. We then similarly evaluated the effects of two lipid-lowering agents, simvastatin and fenofibrate, on atrial fibrosis development in experimental CHF and on cultured atrial fibroblasts. Simvastatin but not fenofibrate attenuated atrial fibrosis, conduction heterogeneity and hemodynamic changes. We observed statin-induced direct inhibition of profibrotic atrial fibroblast responses which may constitute a novel mechanism for preventing the CHF-induced fibrotic AF substrate. Our findings highlight the contribution of irreversible structural remodeling in AF maintenance. Results indicating that AF per se can promote atrial fibrosis underscore the importance of normalizing cardiac rhythm to prevent this outcome, particularly in light of evidence demonstrating atrial sensitivity to fibrotic change. This work is relevant to designing improved strategies for preventing arrhythmogenic structural remodeling, and has revealed novel and potentially promising therapeutic avenues.</description><creator>Burstein, Brett S.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Atrial Fibrillation -- drug therapy.</subject><subject>Fibrosis -- drug therapy.</subject><subject>Heart Atria -- cytology.</subject><subject>Procetofen -- therapeutic use.</subject><subject>Atrial Function -- physiology.</subject><subject>Simvastatin -- therapeutic use.</subject><subject>Stilbenes -- therapeutic use.</subject><title>Arrhythmogenic structural remodeling : novel insights into consequences, determinants and therapeutic potential</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/00000361b.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/47429f023</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0p096b66t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis examines the interaction between brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens). The goal of the thesis was to add to our understanding of the food web dynamics of intraguild predation in fish communities through an exploration of the trophic ecology of brook trout. Results suggest brook trout and yellow perch interact as intraguild predator and prey---juvenile brook trout and yellow perch compete for shared resources and adult brook trout prey on yellow perch---and that the outcome of the interaction is dependant upon yellow perch abundance and ecosystem size. In the presence of yellow perch, juvenile brook trout exhibited an ontogenetic diet shift to a high reliance on pelagic-linked prey unlike populations from non-perch lakes which maintained a strong link to littoral energetic pathways throughout ontogeny. Brook trout shifted to piscivory at a length of 25 cm and yellow perch became the dominant prey item. Brook trout abundance was approximately 75% lower in lakes containing yellow perch, suggesting differences in brook trout trophic ecology had population level effects. Removal of greater than 70% of yellow perch biomass from a 35 ha lake resulted in improved juvenile brook trout growth and condition. The availability of zooplankton and zoobenthos increased and brook trout 20 to 30 cm in length increased their consumption of littoral-linked prey. Piscivorous brook trout continued to prey primarily on yellow perch despite the significant reduction in perch density and brook trout trophic position was unchanged. These results suggest reduced perch biomass may lead to increased recruitment of piscivorous brook trout and shift the interaction between the two species toward dominance by brook trout. Based on a historical study of brook trout diet using archived scale samples, the presence of lake trout, a second predator on yellow perch, was shown to have no effect on the resource use of brook trout, suggesting top-down control of yellow perch populations does not occur in these systems. On the other hand, ecosystem size was shown to alter the outcome of the interaction between brook trout and yellow perch. In lakes with surface area greater than 100 ha, book trout were strongly linked to littoral energetic pathways despite the presence of yellow perch, indicating the two species were able to partition the littoral niche in large lakes. It is hypothesized that the increased proportion of non-depositional benthic habitat in large lakes results in a greater availability of large zoobenthos thereby reducing the effect of resource competition with yellow perch on brook trout growth and abundance. Consistent with theoretical predictions of the effect of enrichment on intraguild predation interactions, adult brook trout exhibited greater omnivory in large lakes as evidenced by lower trophic position relative to populations from small lakes. Further investigation of intraguild predation between brook trout and yellow perch may add to our understanding of how shifts in trophic linkages between littoral and pelagic energetic pathways affect fish community dynamics and provide further insight into the ontogeny of piscivory in freshwater salmonids and the dynamics of size-structured interactions.</description><creator>Browne, David R., 1971-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Yellow perch -- Ecology -- Ontario -- Algonquin Provincial Park.</subject><subject>Brook trout -- Ecology -- Ontario -- Algonquin Provincial Park.</subject><title>The effect of yellow perch on the trophic ecology of brook trout : the role of intraguild predation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7p88cm23g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0p096b66t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6682x746f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Aging is often associated with the decline of numerous cognitive functions, especially learning and memory. Stable forms of long-term plasticity require the induction of a cascade of genes to produce and maintain structural changes associated with memory formation in the hippocampus, a brain area essential for spatial memory. Using a microarray approach, global alterations in gene expression were investigated in two animal models of memory deficits; namely Long-Evans rats with memory impairments following systemic administration of scopolamine (a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist), and a cohort of aged Long-Evans rats which naturally develop memory impairments during aging. Among the various hippocampal genes differentially expressed between aged memory-impaired (AI) and aged memory-unimpaired (AU) rats following spatial memory stimulation in the Morris water maze (MWM) task, decreased levels of transthyretin (TTR) gene expression were associated with aged memory deficits. Furthermore, we observed that TTR knock-out (TTR-/-) mice develop memory deficits during aging. The mechanism involved in the effects of TTR in memory formation is apparently related to its role as retinol transporter since a treatment with its active metabolite retinoic acid (RA) reversed cognitive deficits in TTR-/- mice and aged rats. To further investigate the role of RA in memory deficits, we used the common environmental pollutant dioxin (also known as TCDD; 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) to empty retinol storage. We observed that treatment with TCDD induced memory impairments in the MWM task in adult female but not male mice. This gender-specific effect of dioxin on cognitive abilities is reversed by a treatment with RA combined or not with estrogen. In addition, TCDD-induced cognitive impairments are decreased in TTR-/- mice. Scopolamine-treated rats are commonly used as a psychopharmacological model of memory dysfunctions similar to those seen in aging. We identified several novel candidate genes possibly involved in cognition that were altered in scopolamine-treated adult rats following memory stimulation. For example, we found that the sustained overexpression of the glutamatergic receptor component Homer1a or 1c in the hippocampus abolished memory improvements induced by the GABAB receptor antagonist, SGS742, in scopolamine-treated rats. Taken together, the various genes altered in the two animal models used in this thesis suggest potential novel targets to develop more effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of age-related cognitive impairments.</description><creator>Brouillette, Jonathan.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Scopolamine -- pharmacology.</subject><subject>Gene Expression Profiling -- methods.</subject><subject>Prealbumin -- genetics.</subject><subject>Learning -- physiology.</subject><subject>Rats.</subject><subject>Hippocampus -- physiology.</subject><subject>Memory -- physiology.</subject><title>Characterization of novel genes involved in learning and memory in rodent models</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gm80j020s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6682x746f</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:m613n208f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis, the implication of chiral symmetry implementation for the pion-induced dissociation of the J/psi is examined. A brief introduction of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and relativistic heavy ion collisions is first presented followed by a discussion on charmonium modification in nuclear matter. For the latter, a particular emphasis is put on describing the various models used to evaluate the J/psi-dissociation by a meson gas. The consequence of chiral symmetry on the dissociation cross-section by a pion is then explicated. In particular, it is shown that the low-energy dynamics of pions is constrained by the symmetry and that this property is lacking in most present models found in the literature. The derived soft-pion theorem is then integrated into a simple Lagrangian model. The relative importance of the symmetry effect is then assessed in a more comprehensive Lagrangian model and in a model using a constituent quark-based approach.</description><creator>Bourque, François-Alex.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Charmonium.</subject><subject>Particles (Nuclear physics) -- Chirality.</subject><subject>Meson-nucleon interactions.</subject><title>J[psi] dissociation by light mesons : a journey around the chiral circle</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/028710623.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m613n208f</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z316q519g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The ribosome recruitment phase of translation initiation is the rate-limiting step of protein synthesis and involves binding of the 40S ribosomal subunit and associated factors to the 5'end of mRNAs. Ribosome recruitment to mRNA templates is catalyzed by the eIF4 class of initiation factors comprising eIF4F, a multisubunit complex that binds to the 5'end of mRNAs and prepares transcripts to receive ribosomes, as well as eIF4B and eIF4H, which help eIF4F in its task. mRNA preparation by eIF4F is thought to be accomplished by the eIF4A subunit of the eIF4F complex, an RNA helicase believed to unwind secondary structure close to the cap structure to facilitate ribosome binding. Deregulated ribosome binding has been shown to contribute to cellular transformation. The ribosome recruitment phase of initiation therefore emerged as an attractive chemotherapeutic target, however a limited number of approaches have been described that target this process in vivo. This prompted our laboratory to conduct a high throughput screening campaign aimed at identifying novel small molecule inhibitors of the ribosome recruitment phase of translation initiation. We identified three types of natural products; pateamine, hippuristanol and cyclopenta[b]benzofurans, that were all found to inhibit translation initiation in vitro and in vivo, and to target the eIF4A subunit of the eIF4F complex. Characterization of the small molecules identified in the high throughput screen revealed that although these compounds target the same initiation factor, their mechanism of action is different. Given the role of the ribosome recruitment phase of translation initiation in tumorigenesis and chemoresistance, the effects of cyclopenta[b]benzofurans were tested in a mouse lymphoma model of drug resistance mediated by activation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway, and one compound, silvestrol, was found to reverse chemoresistance in this system. Characterization of the eIF4A modulators described herein also revealed that these compounds can be used to study cellular processes involving translation. The small molecules described in this thesis therefore represent potential drug leads for cancer therapy as well as a powerful arsenal of small molecules to evaluate the role of eIF4A and translation initiation in various cellular processes.</description><creator>Bordeleau, Marie-Eve.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Benzofurans -- pharmacology.</subject><subject>RNA, Messenger -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4A -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Epoxy Compounds -- pharmacology.</subject><subject>Sterols -- pharmacology.</subject><title>Chemical dissection of eIF4A-mediated translation</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/79408164d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z316q519g</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6108vg03d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis is concerned with optical self-inscription in solgel derived nanocomposite waveguides. During self-inscription, an electromagnetic wave propagating in a photosensitive medium induces a permanent local increase in refractive index. In turn, this change in refractive index creates a waveguide for the electromagnetic wave that induced it. We discuss similarities and differences between optical self-inscription and the well-known optical spatial solitons which arise in media supporting a transient change in refractive index. In particular, we show that, as for spatial solitons, optical self-inscription can give rise to straight waveguides, waveguides with periodic corrugations and two counterpropagating self-writing beams can undergo mutual-trapping. These experimental results are confirmed by our numerical simulations. Under certain circumstances, optical self-inscription can become unstable and the writing beam undergoes filamentation. Beam filamentation is a complex process. After beam break-up, individual filaments can exchange optical power with other filaments, new filaments can form and existing filaments can vanish. We discuss the effect of material composition and exposure conditions on self-writing instability. Optical self-inscription can be used to direct pattern formation. Solgel derived films form wrinkle patterns when exposed to solvent. The wrinkle patterns formed are isotropic and, surprisingly, exhibit two wrinkling modes. We show that the wrinkling characteristic wavelength can be tuned by modifying the film processing conditions. Wrinkle patterns are shown to be strongly aligned in films where self-inscription was performed. We further demonstrate that wrinkles can be aligned along curved patterns or quenched by combinations of self-written tracks in films.</description><creator>Bélanger, Nicolas, 1977-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Solitons.</subject><subject>Optical wave guides -- Design and construction.</subject><title>Optical self-inscription in solgel derived waveguides</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sb397c81q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6108vg03d</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p5547w052</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We have carried out large scale Monte Carlo simulations of site and bond frustrated Heisenberg models in order to gain insight into experimental phase diagrams on bond and site frustrated magnetic materials. In the case of site frustrated models, we find that spin glass ordering does not take place on either the simple cubic or body-centered cubic lattices which are bipartite. Instead, the model decouples into either one or two percolating clusters of ferromagnetic (antiferromagnetic) sites which order ferromagnetically (antiferromagnetically). The ordering is similar to the situation which exists when ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic sites do not interact at all. Including an interaction between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic sites, to create frustration, causes the ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AF) order to become mutually perpendicular while increasing both TC and TN. This behaviour is similar to what occurs in our experiments on site frustrated a-(Fe100-xMnx)78Si8B 14; for this alloy ferromagnetic and spin glass order co-exist transverse to one another for 0.17 &lt; x &lt; 0.31. Geometrical frustration likely plays a significant role in the material since the glass structure cannot support antiferromagnetic order, unlike bipartite lattices. We conjecture that the site frustrated model on the non-bipartite face-centered cubic lattice, which is geometrically frustrated with respect to AF order, produces a spin glass with sufficient randomness and would make a superior model. In the case of bond frustrated models, we have found that the phase diagram includes all of the bulk phases predicted in mean field theory by Gabay and Toulouse over 25 years ago, despite the long held view that Heisenberg spin glasses do not order in three dimensions. In particular we find that the model orders ferromagnetically at small concentrations of frustration, and in all cases where ferromagnetic order occurs (0 &lt; x &lt; 0.21) there is a second low temperature transition where spin glass ordering occurs transverse to the magnetization at Txy, in full agreement with our experiments on the bond frustrated alloy a-FexZr 100-x. In addition, we find that the spin glass phase exists at finite TSG for 0.21 &lt; x ≤ 0.5 (the phase diagram is symmetrical about x = 0.5). TSG possesses a small clearly detectable concentration dependence, and we find that at x c = 0.21(1), TC, Txy, and TSG merge at a multicritical point. We have followed the evolution of Txy with magnetic field B for both the model and the material and we find full agreement between the two; Txy is found to behave as Txy(B) = Txy(0)(1 - BB+J ) where J is a constant. That this particular equation, first suggested to describe experimental results, also accounts for the field dependance of Txy in our bond frustrated model demonstrates that the only ingredients needed to describe the material is the presence of random competing bonds.</description><creator>Beath, Alexander D.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Spin glasses.</subject><subject>Spin glasses -- Mathematical models.</subject><title>Phase diagrams of bond and site frustrated magnetic material : experiments and theory</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s4655m07w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p5547w052</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:w6634716c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, (ADHD), is one of the most common behavioral disorders in children. The role of culture on ADHD symptoms has received little attention in the literature. As a result, trying to determine the extent of which our current knowledge on ADHD is externally valid for other western as well as non-western societies including developing countries remains the challenge. The purpose of this research was to examine the prevalence of ADHD symptoms in Lebanon, a developing Middle Eastern country. The present study provides the first epidemiological data on ADHD symptoms in Lebanese children and is the first to use a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to explore the influence of culture on the identification and understanding of ADHD symptoms. Data was collected in two phases. In the qualitative phase, a total of 21 key informants were interviewed. An open-ended questionnaire based on the concept of the Patients Explanatory Models of Kleinman was used and all responses were analyzed based on Corin's model of sign, meaning and action. The quantitative phase included a sample of 1746 children, Christian and Muslim, in grades kindergarten through four and between the ages of five and 11 years. Two commonly used instruments were employed in this study: a checklist based on the DSM-IV, (Swanson, Nolan &amp; Pelham: SNAP-IV, Swanson, 1992), as well as Achenbach's Teacher Report Form (TRF, Achenbach, 1991). The quantitative results of this study were consistent with other studies, using the same methodology, in terms of the overall prevalence of ADHD symptoms, which was 22.3% in this Lebanese population. In terms of the different ADHD subtypes, it was found that symptoms consistent with the ADHD-I subtype was the most frequent whereas the ADHD-C subtype was the least frequent in terms of overall prevalence. This result is consistent with other community studies using DSM-IV criteria and teacher rating scales, but is inconsistent with most clinic-based samples where the prevalence of ADHD-C is the most common subtype. Furthermore, in terms of child characteristics, gender and age were significantly associated with ADHD symptoms. There were a greater number of males than females who were regarded as having ADHD symptoms and this is consistent with most studies. However, in relation to the age factor, in general, the overall prevalence of ADHD symptoms was found to increase with the age of children. These results are inconsistent with the North American literature in which it is well documented that, overall ADHD symptoms tend to decrease with age. Factor analysis performed on the Lebanese data, identified and confirmed the presence of a bidimensional construct as suggested by the DSM-IV. In terms of cultural differences, a comparison of the Lebanese data with that of an American sample found a difference in frequency of symptoms as well as in terms of the Internalizing and Externalizing factors. Overall, Lebanese children were rated by teachers as having lower levels of problem behavior than American children. Furthermore, in terms of the Externalizing factor, Lebanese children were found to have lower scores than American children in all age groups, regardless of sex. Finally, SES, religion and language of school instruction were found to be associated with the prevalence rate of ADHD symptoms in Lebanon. In conclusion, in order to ensure that a specific diagnosis is valid it is crucial to understand that diagnosis can differ cross culturally at many levels. Even though the prevalence of ADHD symptoms in Lebanon were found to be similar to other countries, the perception and understanding of these symptoms was very different as seen by the key informants. The results suggest that that traditional treatment and intervention used for ADHD in Western countries may not be directly as successful in a country like Lebanon and that culturally sensitive approaches should be developed in collaboration with local mental health and education professionals.</description><creator>Bathiche, Marie E., 1970-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Lebanon -- epidemiology</subject><subject>Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity -- epidemiology -- Lebanon.</subject><title>The prevalence of ADHD symptoms in a culturally diverse and developing country, Lebanon /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fj236585j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w6634716c</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychiatry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6395wc15d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Paternal exposure to therapeutic drugs or environmental chemicals can alter the genomic integrity of male germ cells, and consequently, be a source of detrimental effects on embryo development. Preconceptional exposure of male rats to the anticancer alkylating agent, cyclophosphamide, resulted in increased embryo loss, malformations and behavioral deficits in the offspring; these drug effects can be transmissible to subsequent generations. The goal of the studies presented in this thesis is to gain an understanding of the manner by which altered spermatozoal genomic integrity, acquired during preconceptional exposure to a DNA damaging agent, may lead to developmental instabilities in the early preimplantation embryo. Spermatozoa must be functional in order to effectively transmit genetic information to the oocyte. Motility is one component contributing to the ability of the spermatozoon to achieve proximity to and penetration of the oocyte for fertilization. Chronic cyclophosphamide exposure had little effect on the kinematic parameters constituting spermatozoal motion patterns. Drug-exposed spermatozoa are motile, and may thus be at an increased risk of transmitting an altered genomic complement to the embryo. An intact paternal genome is essential for normal embryogenesis. Using the rat sperm Y-4 fluorescence in situ hybridization assay, we determined that 9 weeks of chronic cyclophosphamide treatment, but not 6 weeks, significantly increased the frequency of numerical chromosomal abnormalities in epididymal spermatozoa. Epigenetic marks, characterized by various posttranslational modifications, also play an intricate role in chromatin dynamics during spermatogenesis and embryogenesis. Early post-fertilization, histone H4 acetylation and DNA methylation were dysregulated in both parental pronuclei in zygotes sired by cyclophosphamide-treated males. Intriguingly, posttranslational modifications important for DNA damage recognition are rapidly activated following fertilization by drug-exposed spermatozoa. Phosphorylated histone H2AX was dramatically increased in a biphasic manner in the paternal genome; Interestingly, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 was markedly elevated in both the paternal and maternal genome in zygotes fertilized by cyclophosphamide-treated males. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that male germ cell damage acquired during spermatogenesis can be transmitted to the embryo leading to aberrant epigenetic reprogramming and a dramatic induction of distinct modifications involved in DNA damage recognition in the 1-cell embryo. Importantly, we have highlighted the involvement of pronuclear cross talk as a unique phenomenon for both epigenetic reprogramming and DNA damage response in the zygote.</description><creator>Barton-Maclaren, Tara S.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Embryonic Development -- drug effects.</subject><subject>DNA Damage.</subject><subject>Cyclophosphamide -- adverse effects.</subject><subject>Spermatozoa -- drug effects.</subject><title>The impact of cyclophosphamide on male germ cell quality and consequences on early post-fertilization events /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xs55mg48w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6395wc15d</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cc08hk22c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) colorectal cancers (CRCs) possess such features as heavy infiltration by intraepithelial tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (iTILs), a relatively good prognosis, and truncating mutations in the type II TGFbeta receptor (TGFbetaRII). The aim of this study was to examine the possibility of a connection between these phenomena in MSI-H CRCs. Immunohistochemical analysis identified increased tumor TGFbeta expression as predictive of high iTIL counts in MSI-H CRCs but not in microsatellite stable (MSS) CRCs. Abundant iTILs were associated with longer survival times only for patients with MSS tumors. These results indicate that iTILs in MSI-H CRCs are not part of an active anti-tumor immune response. Since TGFbeta can autoinduce itself, the extent of sensitivity of TGFbetaRII deficient MSI-H CRC cell lines was determined using an inhibitor of the complementary TGFbeta type I receptor. MSI-H CRCs remained sensitive to endogenously produced TGFbeta via this receptor. However, autoinduction of TGFbeta by endogenous cytokine was not seen and seems unlikely to explain the association between high TGFbeta and iTILs. The search for an alternate signaling mechanism to account for persistent endogenous TGFbeta sensitivity led to the identification of a membrane-bound form of TGFbeta on CRC cells. This membranous-TGFbeta was able to initiate cell-cell contact dependent signaling in both adjacent CRC cells and lymphocytes, thereby representing a novel mode of paracrine tumor TGFbeta signaling. In order to explore the origin and effects of TGFbeta on CRC/iTIL interactions, a Transwell system was used allowing for basolateral migration of either peripherally- or intraepithelially-derived lymphocytes into CRC monolayers. MSI-H CRCs preferentially retained and expanded lymphocytes from the latter population and were found to induce a lesser degree of T cell activation than their MSS counterparts. TGFbeta played a modulatory, though not definitive, role in the observed CRC/lymphocyte interactions. Inferior activation by MSI-H CRCs may explain the lack of prognostic benefit conferred by iTILs within these cancers. We have thus documented within MSI-H CRCs an association between iTILs and TGFbeta which is not mediated by TGFbetaRII mutation, a lack of association between iTILs and survival, and a probable origin for iTILs within a pretolerized intraepithelial lymphocyte subset.</description><creator>Baker, Kristi Dorothy.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Colorectal Neoplasms -- genetics.</subject><subject>Microsatellite Instability.</subject><subject>Colorectal Neoplasms -- immunology.</subject><subject>Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating -- immunology.</subject><subject>Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta -- genetics.</subject><title>A link between TGF[beta] and intraepithelial tumor inflitrating lymphocytes in microsatellite instability-high colorectal cancer /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b8515r92p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cc08hk22c</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pathology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:12579w88q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Linear precoding can be viewed as a convenient way to enhance the throughput and performance of a Multi-Input-Multi-Output (MIMO) communications system for its linear nature that facilitates its low-complexity implementation in a transceiver. Nevertheless, linear precoding designs usually assume instantaneous channel responses perfectly known at the transmitter, which is unrealistically difficult (if not impossible) in fast time-varying channels. An alternative to the assumption of full channel state knowledge is to consider the availability of partial channel knowledge at the transmitter, including information that changes much slower than the instantaneous channel responses such as the channel statistical parameters. The work presented in this thesis focuses on the design of precoding schemes that are mainly based on partial channel information. Starting with point-to-point MIMO systems, we show that it is possible to design suitable precoding schemes that achieve a considerable gain in terms of performance or throughput by considering the spatial and path correlation matrices of the frequency-flat and frequency-selective fading channels, respectively. Next, we investigate the problem of transmission in point-to-multipoint MIMO systems based on partial channel information. We show that in a MIMO broadcast system, using a partial channel knowledge-based user selection scheme in conjunction with precoding can provide an asymptotic optimum sum-rate performance for a growing number of users. Using the results obtained in the previous steps, we consider the problem of transmission in cooperative relay networks. We first examine and identify the similarities and differences between MIMO and cooperative relay systems especially in term of diversity and multiplexing gain and their trade-off. We then develop the possible solutions for transmission and reception in the relay networks for both cases: single-antenna and multiple-antenna relay nodes. When a large number of single-antenna relay nodes available in the system, we show that a partial channel-knowledge based relay selection scheme in conjunction with a distributed BLAST transmission scheme can achieve the optimum multiplexing-diversity trade-off. In the case of multi-antenna relay, we first derive the optimum combining scheme at the destination for both amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relay systems, and then address the optimal precoding designs at the source and relay nodes. We show that a generalized maximum ratio combining (GMRC) in conjunction with linear precoding can offer the optimum received SNR for both AF and DF relay systems.</description><creator>Bahrami, Hamid Reza.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Space time codes.</subject><subject>Antenna arrays.</subject><subject>MIMO systems.</subject><title>Partial channel knowledge based precoding for MIMO and cooperative communications</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cc08hk23n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/12579w88q</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0p096b673</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:23Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A recombinant aminopeptidase (pepN) of Lactobacillus rhamnosus S93 was encapsulated in chitosan-coated alginate beads using an extrusion method. The effects of alginate, CaCl2, chitosan concentrations, hardening time, pH, and alginate/enzyme ratios on the encapsulation efficiency (EE) and the enzyme release (ER) were then investigated. Chitosan in the gelling solution significantly increased the encapsulation efficiency (EE) and also retarded the enzyme release (ER) from the beads. The greatest EE was observed in a pH 5.4 solution (chitosan-CaCl2) during bead formation. Increasing the CaCl2 concentration over 0.1 M neither affected the EE nor the ER. Increasing the hardening time beyond 10 min led to a decrease in EE and alginate:enzyme ratio (3:1) was optimal to prevent the ER. Using the free or encapsulated fowl of the recombinant pepN at three different concentrations (50, 500, 2000 units 18 L-1 milk), control and experimental cheeses were prepared in vats containing 18 L milk. The effects of two enzyme forms at the similar concentration were also investigated in larger scale of cheesemaking trial (200 L milk). The amounts of nitrogen soluble in phosphotungstic acid (PTA-N) and free amino acids (FAA) were enhanced by increasing the enzyme concentration. While proline disappeared at 4 months of ripening period, leucine was the most dominant amino acid in the experimental cheeses. Cheese with the encapsulated enzyme at the highest concentration received significantly higher mean levels of PTA-N and total FAAs than the other cheeses. The use of encapsulated enzyme resulted in an acceleration of 70% in proteolysis and superior sensory properties than the control cheese. Almost all encapsulated enzymes were entrapped into the cheese matrix, revealing the stability of the capsules during Cheddar cheese manufacturing. The application of natural and recombinant enzymes of Lactobacillus rhamnosus S93 was also investigated to develop a process of Cheddar-EMC flavorings. Water soluble nitrogen, PTA-N and FAA levels were significantly higher in the proteinase (Neutrase) added EMCs. The highest levels of PTA-N and FAA were evident in samples containing the highest levels of combined natural and recombinant enzymes. Proline disappeared in the experimental EMCs compared to the control over maturation times.</description><creator>Azarnia Koorabbasloo, Sorayya.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Lactobacillus.</subject><subject>Cheesemaking -- Technological innovations.</subject><subject>Cheddar cheese.</subject><subject>Aminopeptidases.</subject><title>Proteolysis enhancement of cheddar cheese and enzyme-modified cheese by free or encapsulated form of natural and recombinant enzymes of Lactobacillus rhamnosus S93</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j3860b374.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0p096b673</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z890rz14c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this work, we study the effects of disorder on quantum Hall systems. We introduce controlled disorder by developing several ion implantation techniques in the context of two-dimensional electron systems. While the transport lifetime depends linearly on the implantation density, the quantum lifetime remains unchanged until the disorder produced by the implantation exceeds a certain critical dose. We fully characterise the defects (size and shape) created by the implantation, by essentially using the two-dimensional electron gas as an in-situ detector. We subsequently study the effect of disorder on various properties of quantum Hall systems, particularly in relation with the interplay of many-body interactions and disorder. For our quantitative analysis, we developed a powerful method to extract various quantities such as fractional excitation gaps and the enhanced g-factor, by explicitly considering the Landau level broadening due to disorder. We show that the fractional gap as well as the enhanced g-factor is not reduced by the presence of a long-range disorder potential in stark contrast to short-range disorder.</description><creator>Avesque, Sophie.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Electron gas.</subject><subject>Ion implantation.</subject><subject>Quantum Hall effect.</subject><title>Ion implantation in quantum Hall systems</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v979v634t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z890rz14c</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h702q983h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>To generate profit and support high volumes of traffic, IP backbone networks are required to provide efficient scalable end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) for a variety of telecommunication services. Scalability is achieved by using class-based QoS provisioning approaches such as Differentiated Services (DiffServ), while efficiency requires the appropriate use of traffic engineering mechanisms such as those provided by Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS). This thesis presents a delay-margin based Traffic Engineering (TE) approach to provide end-to-end QoS in MPLS networks using DiffServ at the link level. The TE, combines mapping flows to routes, mapping routes to QoS classes, and the definition of each class delay. The thesis formulates traffic engineering as a nonlinear optimization problem that reflects the inter-class and inter-link dependency introduced by end-to-end QoS requirements of flows, and their aggregation into DiffServ classes. Three algorithms are used to provide a solution to the problem: The first two, centralized offline route configuration, and link-class delay assignment, operate in the convex areas of the feasible region to consecutively reduce the objective function using a per-link per-class decomposition of the objective function gradient. The third one is a heuristic that promotes/demotes connections at different links in order to deal with concave areas that may be produced by a trunk route usage of more than one class on a given link. Approximations of the three algorithms suitable for online distributed TE operation are derived. Simulation is used to show that the proposed approach can increase the number of users while maintaining end-to-end QoS requirements. To estimate the queue length and delay distributions versus changes in the traffic characteristic, the available capacity variation, the loading, and the change in queue weights that are introduced by the proposed TE approach, a multi-scale queue performance analysis technique is proposed. At each scale, the queue weights or priority dependencies are exploited to convert the multi-queue problem into a set of single-queue problems. The core of the analysis is in using Variable Service rate Multi-Scale Queuing (VS-MSQ) to estimate the multi-scale capacity available to each queue. The thesis shows the hierarchy of this estimation and the dependency of the each queue variable capacity on the unused capacity of the other queues and their weights or priority. Simulation and analytical results on the queue length and delay survivor functions are in a good agreement.</description><creator>Ashour, Mohamed.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>MPLS standard.</subject><subject>Telecommunication -- Traffic -- Management.</subject><subject>Computer networks -- Management.</subject><subject>Packet switching (Data transmission)</subject><subject>Internet.</subject><title>End-to-end delay margin based traffic engineering</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k643b4699.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/h702q983h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8910jz04n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>X-ray scattering is an ideal technique to perform measurements on the structures of materials. In the present thesis we use x-ray reflectivity (XRR) to study the structural properties of layers and multilayers. A trilayer system of CoFe-Ru-CoFe used for spin valve multilayers is investigated and the changes in structural properties induced by different procedures such as changing the Ru spacer layer, oxidation of the Ru spacer layer and annealing the sample are studied. Also, we study the electron density, thickness and optical index of refraction of samples prepared by glancing angle deposition (GLAD) method. We investigate the porosity in these samples by XRR technique. We use a method to calculate the reflectivity for any given density profile by dividing it into N-step layers. In this model, a continuous function describes the density profile in the interfaces. Two different types of graded and rough interfaces are introduced and their effect on the x-ray diffuse scattering is discussed. We use a method of x-ray specular data collection that separates the diffuse scattering from the specular. The computer programs are written in the Yorick interpreted language based on specular and diffuse x-ray scattering models to fit the data using a non-linear least squares fitting method. By fitting the XRR data of CoFe-Ru-CoFe trilayers, it is revealed that the increasing thickness of the Ru spacer layer decreases the sheet resistivity of the sample. While, the oxidation of the spacer layer leads to an increase in the sheet resistivity. The electron density profile of the GLAD samples are investigated and a linear density profile is concluded. The slope of this linear density profiles turns out to be an angle of deposition dependent parameter. These profiles, also, reveal that the porosity of the GLAD samples increases with increasing the deposition angle.</description><creator>Asgharizadeh, Saeid.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>X-rays -- Scattering.</subject><subject>Magnetoresistance.</subject><subject>Metallic films.</subject><title>X-ray reflectivity study of GMR and porous silicon thin layers</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/79408165p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8910jz04n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:c247dw990</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This program of research was designed to examine motivational factors associated with students' academic engagement. Self-determination theory (SDT; Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000) posits that healthy adaptation requires satisfaction of three fundamental psychological needs: competence, autonomy, and relatedness. Environments that satisfy the three fundamental needs have been associated with optimal goal engagement and well being. The present thesis explores how need satisfaction and possible conflicts among the three fundamental needs may affect students' academic engagement. Article 1 examines need conflict resulting from peer norms regarding the pursuit of academic competence. Article 2 examines possible interference between the quality of students' part-time work experiences and students' academic need satisfaction and engagement. Article 1 reports the development of a scale to assess the extent to which student's perceive conflict in their pursuit of academic competence with the experience of autonomy and relatedness. Over 500 students completed surveys assessing need satisfaction, need conflict, and drop-out intentions. The results showed that need conflict was associated with higher school dropout intentions as reported by students, parents and their teachers. The relation of need conflict to dropout held true after controlling for students' need satisfaction, grade point average, and indicators of general adjustment. A one-year follow-up assessment showed that increases in need conflict predicted increases in dropout intentions. The results of this research point to the risk inherent in youth development when satisfaction of need for competence is put into conflict with satisfaction of the needs for autonomy or relatedness. Article 2 explored the relation of part-time work experiences to school drop out intentions among high school and junior college students. Over 3500 students from rural and suburban schools completed a survey which assessed number of hours students worked, the amount of need satisfaction they experienced at work and the extent to which work experiences interfered with school functioning. Academic drop out intentions, school need satisfaction and grade point average were also assessed. The results indicated a curvilinear relation between work hours and drop-out intentions. Part-time work was associated with lower drop-out intentions than not working, except in the case where students worked more than 20 hours per week. Drop out intentions were predicted by the perception that work interfered with school, which, in turn, was related to whether or not employers supported students' school involvement. The results of these studies suggest that need satisfaction and need conflict are important variables associated with academic engagement.</description><creator>Gagnon, Hugo.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Academic achievement.</subject><subject>Motivation in education.</subject><subject>Dropouts.</subject><subject>Need (Psychology)</subject><subject>Conflict (Psychology)</subject><title>Need satisfaction, conflict and academic disengagement : an extension of self-determination theory</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/br86b703h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c247dw990</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:s4655m085</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Although important advances have been achieved in the treatment of individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1), the development of resistance to current antiretroviral drugs is a topic of major concern. The K65R, L74V and M184V mutations within HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) share numerous characteristics, such as similar discriminatory mechanisms in regard to incorporation of relevant nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs), decreased viral replication capacity and hypersusceptibility to zidovudine (ZDV-HS). Despite our increased understanding of NRTI resistance, the biochemical basis for the observed resistance/hypersusceptibility to certain NRTIs as well as diminished viral replication associated with the aforementioned mutations is not completely understood. The present thesis evaluated molecular mechanisms associated with efficiency of (-)ssDNA synthesis, resistance to relevant NRTIs, ZDV-HS and viral replication in the context of each of the K65R, L74V and M184V mutations and relevant combinations of them. We observed that the K65R, L74V and M 184V mutations in RT caused reductions in ATP-dependent removal of ZDV-MP from newly synthesized viral DNA. In addition, we determined that the L74V and M184V mutations did not affect the ratio between the populations of RT-DNA/DNA complexes found at pre- and post-translocational stages. Also, we showed that K65R-, L74V-, and M184V-containing viruses displayed diminished replication and that this is associated with reduced levels of synthesis of early reverse transcribed viral DNA molecules. Finally, we determined the biochemical mechanism involved in reduced susceptibility to apricitabine of K65R-containing viruses.</description><creator>Frankel, Fernando A.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Drug Resistance, Viral.</subject><subject>Anti-HIV Agents -- metabolism.</subject><subject>HIV-1 Reverse Transcriptase -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors -- metabolism.</subject><subject>HIV-1 -- drug effects.</subject><title>Role of the K65R, L74V, and M184V mutations within HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in drug resistance and viral replication</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9w0326534.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s4655m085</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:v405sf064</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Cancer cells commonly lose expression of cell adhesion molecules, such as E-cadherin and CEACAM1, with disease progression. Re-introduction of these molecules into high-grade tumor cells results in suppression of tumor growth and invasion. To elicit this change in malignant behavior, these adhesion molecules require an intact cytoplasmic domain. Invasion suppression necessitates interaction of the cytoplasmic tail with specific intracellular proteins; simple cell adhesion is not sufficient to abrogate invasion. The Coxsackievirus and Adenovirus Receptor (CAR) is a recently identified cell adhesion molecule whose expression is downregulated in cancer progression. It is a 46-kDa transmembrane protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. It was initially identified as a receptor for the attachment of group B coxsackievirus and adenovirus. Recently, CAR has been shown to have an endogenous role in suppressing cancer cell growth and invasion in prostate and bladder cancer and gliomas. Our laboratory has shown that CAR behaves much like other cell adhesion molecules in a glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) model: (1) Re-introduction into GBM cell lines reduces invasive potential. (2) An intact cytoplasmic domain is required for abrogation of invasion. We have searched for proteins that interact with its cytoplasmic domain. We have used proteomic analysis to identify proteins that bind to a GST-CAR fusion protein comprised of the cytoplasmic domain of CAR. We have identified tubulin, beta-catenin, and IQ-containing motif GTPase Activating Protein-1 (IQGAP1) as protein interactors with CAR. This thesis will characterize the interactions of these proteins with CAR. Futhermore, the functional implications of each interaction have been explored and will be further discussed. These data support CAR's role at the crossroads of cell adhesion, migration, and growth and provides a framework upon which to understand the tangible mechanism for CAR's anti-invasive and anti-tumorigenic properties.</description><creator>Fok, Patrick Terrence.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear.</subject><subject>ras GTPase-Activating Proteins.</subject><subject>Cell Movement.</subject><subject>beta Catenin.</subject><subject>Tubulin.</subject><subject>Receptors, Virus -- physiology.</subject><subject>Cell Adhesion.</subject><subject>Transcription Factors.</subject><title>The identification of protein-protein interactors of the Coxsackievirus and Adenovirus Receptor (CAR) and their impact on cell migration /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b8515r93z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/v405sf064</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:c821gp55d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>With an increase in the aging population, research has attempted to elucidate factors that determine the heterogeneity observed in cognitive function within the older adult population. Studies have shown that elevated levels of glucocorticoids (GC) in serum and saliva are related to poorer cognitive performance in old age. However, individual differences are also noted in GC secretion, which gives rise to the question of what determines individual differences not only in cognitive function, but also in GC secretion in old age. While many researchers have turned to personality as an individual difference factor, the present thesis wanted to assess an underlying factor that is incontestably stable over the lifespan, genetic polymorphism. Thus, the general goal of the present dissertation was to assess the influence of genetic variance on cognition, personality, basal and stress reactive cortisol secretion, while controlling for factors that could impact stress-reactivity, namely education. Three candidate genes were examined in two sample cohorts of older adults: the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE, E4 vs. nonE4), the butyrylcholinesterase gene (BCHE, K vs. nonK), and the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor gene (-1438A/G, AA vs. GG vs. AG). The first cohort allowed for the assessment of genes on acute (i.e. short term) basal and stress-reactive salivary cortisol secretion, personality, and cognitive performance. The second cohort was a longitudinal sample that allowed for assessment of change over time in GC secretion and cognitive performance as a function of genotype. Overall, it was found that APOE alone did not explain the variance in acute or longitudinal cognitive performance, personality, or cortisol secretion. However, a genetic interaction was observed between APOE and BCHE in explaining variance in acute basal serum cortisol levels, acute declarative memory performance, and scores on a depression and self-esteem scale. Assessment of the 5-HT2A receptor gene showed that the -1438A/G polymorphism could explain variance in basal and stress-reactive salivary GC levels, performance on declarative memory and selective attention, and personality traits associated with low mood. Finally, this was the first study to show that education may modulate the stress response to a psychosocial stressor. Altogether, the aforementioned findings show the importance of evaluating genetic polymorphisms of candidate genes in explaining individual differences in cognitive aging. Further, genetic influence is not limited to one gene, but involves many genetic markers that affect various physiological systems.</description><creator>Fiocco, Alexandra Jasmine.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Hydrocortisone -- secretion.</subject><subject>Cognition -- physiology.</subject><subject>Aging -- psychology.</subject><subject>Aged.</subject><subject>Stress -- physiopathology.</subject><subject>Aging -- pathology.</subject><title>An examination of three candidate genes in association with cognitive performance, personality traits, and glucocorticoid secretion in older adults /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/76537457r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/c821gp55d</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k0698c224</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Sepsis is associated with a high rate of mortality due primarily to increased susceptibility to secondary infections as well as immune-mediated vascular injury, a key initiating event in organ injury leading to Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS). The activated neutrophil is central to both of these complications. Neutrophil induced endothelial cell damage is well recognized as a cause of microvascular leakage, and neutrophil delivery to infected sites is diminished in sepsis. To investigate the mechanisms and vascular consequences of neutrophil migratory failure in systemic inflammation, a physiologically relevant murine two-hit model of sepsis was employed (systemic infection - cecal ligation and puncture/local infection - intrascrotal 107 E. coli). Intra-vital microscopy at the cremaster level in mice given systemic infection, local infection, both, or control revealed that migratory failure in systemic infection completely attenuated the increased delivery of neutrophils and microvascular leak mediated by local infection. Pulmonary sequestration, regionalization of a limited pool of neutrophils, and altered adhesion molecule expression were identified as possible mechanisms for this finding. Soluble L-selectin injected to levels present in septic humans significantly reduced leukocyte rolling in non-inflamed cremaster post-capillary venule endothelium in a dose dependent fashion. High levels of soluble L-selectin completely attenuated Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNFalpha) mediated increases in neutrophil adherence and microvascular leakage. Employing a novel two-hit model of sepsis (systemic inflammation - intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide/local inflammation - intra-scrotal TNFalpha), prevention of L-selectin shedding with sheddase inhibitor Ro 31-9790 resulted in increased neutrophil adherence and microvascular leak in locally inflamed endothelium, reversing the migratory failure seen with systemic infection or inflammation. These results suggest that L-selectin shedding and release of soluble L-selectin represent a protective mechanism by which the host attempts to limit the deleterious systemic effects of activated leukocytes, such as remote neutrophil adherence and inflammation-mediated end-organ injury.</description><creator>Ferri, Lorenzo E.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Sepsis -- drug therapy.</subject><subject>L-Selectin -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Leukocyte Rolling -- drug effects.</subject><subject>Neutrophils -- immunology.</subject><title>Mechanisms and vascular consequences for the diminished delivery of neutrophils in sepsis : a protective role for soluble L-selectin</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dv13zx85c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k0698c224</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Surgical Research</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8w32r895n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Considerable data indicate that multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune-mediated inflammatory disease of the CNS. Naive CD4 T cells play a central role in this autoimmune response and occupy a niche that is homeostatically regulated. Homeostatic influences include thymic output, naive CD4 T cell proliferation and receipt of death and survival signals. Altered naive CD4 T cell homeostasis could account for increased autoreactivity of these T cells in MS. We hypothesize that RRMS patients have perturbed naive CD4 T cell homeostasis. Signal joint T cell receptor excision circles (sjTRECs) and betaTRECS are generated as byproducts of T cell receptor (TCR) alphabeta gene rearrangements. TRECs persist as cytoplasmic episomes in T cells and consequently are diluted by peripheral T cell proliferation. Although sjTRECs are commonly used as a surrogate measure of thymic output, decreased sjTRECs may reflect increased peripheral T cell proliferation and not necessarily decreased thymic output. Here, we offer a novel approach to analyze TREC data that eliminates confounding from peripheral proliferation. We present novel evidence of significantly decreased sjTREC levels in naive CD4 T cells and in naive CD4 recent thymic emigrants (RTEs) in RRMS. Decreased survival signals and reduced intrathymic proliferation do not cause this decrease. We find increased peripheral homeostatic proliferation and a further dilution of sjTREC levels in naive CD4 T cells compared to naive CD4 RTEs. Collectively, these data suggest that decreased thymic output occurs in RRMS with compensatory peripheral proliferation to maintain naive CD4 T cell niche size. Additionally, we provide first evidence of age-inappropriate declines in sjTREC levels in naive CD4 RTEs and confirm previous findings in naive CD4 T cells, supporting claims of premature thymic involution in RRMS. Finally, we describe decreases in individual betaTREC levels, i.e. decreased TCR beta diversity in RRMS, which further points to a thymic abnormality in RRMS. We conclude that there is perturbed naive CD4 T cell homeostasis in RRMS secondary to a thymic abnormality which leads to a contraction of the naive CD4 T cell repertoire. This altered T cell repertoire may lead to increased autoreactivity and predispose an individual to developing RRMS.</description><creator>Duszczyszyn, Danielle Andrea.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Homeostasis -- immunology.</subject><subject>Thymus Gland -- immunology.</subject><subject>CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes -- immunology.</subject><subject>Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting -- immunology.</subject><title>Perturbed naïve CD4 T cell homeostasis, with evidence of thymic abnormality in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6t053k81s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8w32r895n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pathology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:df65vc18n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Satellites provide uniform data coverage globally. Thus, their data have the potential to reduce analysis errors in data sparse areas significantly, thereby improving numerical weather prediction (NWP) model forecasts. We describe a previously-used methodology to generate NWP model initial conditions (ICs) from satellite total column ozone data based on three principal steps: (1) convert a chemical total column ozone field to a dynamical mean potential vorticity (MPV) field via linear regression, (2) convert the 2D MPV field to a 3D potential vorticity (PV) field via vertical mapping onto average PV profiles, (3) invert the 3D PV field to obtain model-initializing height, temperature and wind fields in the mid and upper troposphere. Our contribution to the discipline has been to increase significantly the overall accuracy of the process through a substantial reworking of the details of this previous version. For instance, in recognition of the fact that total column ozone ridges tend to be less reliable than troughs, the MPV field that is converted to a 3D PV field in the second step is a synthesis of ozone-derived MPV troughs and analysis MPV ridges. We also adjust the vertical mapping procedure of the second step so that the MPV field converts to a more realistic 3D PV field; unrealistic PV features appearing strongly at upper levels and decaying with decreasing altitude are no longer generated. As a result of these and other novel procedures, the previously-described conversion procedure produces a more realistic set of model upper-level initializing fields. Using the 24-25 January 2000 east coast snowstorm as an example, we use the developed methodology to initialize the Mesoscale Compressible Community model (MC2). We find that ozone-influenced upper-level initializing fields improve the quantitative precipitation forecast for two of three (re)analyses. Furthermore, our best forecast of all utilizes ozone-influenced upper-level initializing fields. Finally, this novel procedure gives a quantitative precipitation forecast that is superior to an ozone-influenced four dimensional variational assimilation forecast of the same case. The methodology presented, which generates NWP model ICs from total column ozone data, may be useful for the forecasting of weather systems originating in data sparse areas.</description><creator>Durnford, Dorothy A.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Atmospheric ozone -- Atlantic Coast (Canada).</subject><subject>Numerical weather forecasting -- Atlantic Coast (Canada).</subject><subject>Blizzards -- Atlantic Coast (Canada).</subject><title>A procedure to convert total column ozone data to numerical weather prediction model initializing fields, and its validation via simulations of the 24-25 January 2000 east coast snowstorm /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/q237hw27h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/df65vc18n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:f4752m48c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Extensive evidence supports a dimensional approach to the derivation of personality and other behavioral traits in human and animal studies, and suggests that personality traits are hierarchically organized with more specific lower-order traits combining to form higher order-traits. We used this approach in an exploration of the structure of normal behavior in juvenile and adolescent vervet monkeys in a prospective longitudinal study. The goals of this thesis were to determine whether we could successfully identify behavioral traits in &gt;200 African green (or vervet) monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops) based on standard well documented primatological behavioral measures in (1) social groups and (2) novelty challenge tests. The behavioral data was collected using a systematic methodological approach called focal animal testing (Altmann, 1973) and consisted of direct observations rather than the assigning descriptive adjectives. The data was subsequently analyzed using factor analysis to derive interpretable behavioral dimensions. In the first study presented in this thesis, we extracted five interpretable behavioral dimensions from the Social Juvenile condition. These five behavioral dimensions in order of decreasing proportional variance were "agonism," "energetic sociability," agreeableness," "playfulness," and "behavioral inhibition." The first two factors showed a negative relationship with age, while the remaining three factors were positively correlated with age. Males scored higher on "playfulness," while females had higher scores for "energetic sociability" and "agreeableness." Monkeys which scored highly for "agonism" had significantly higher social rank, while those which scored highly for "behavioral inhibition" had significantly lower rank. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of the serotonin metabolite 5-HIAA were negatively correlated with Factor 3, "agreeableness," and levels of the norepinephrine metabolite MHPG were negatively correlated with Factor 5, "behavioral inhibition." In the second study presented in this thesis, we identified four interpretable behavioral dimensions from the first of two novelty testing paradigms. Monkeys in late infancy were exposed to a novel environment physically very different from their home cage, and baited with rewards and opportunities for exploration. The four behavioral dimensions, which emerged, in order of decreasing proportional variance, were termed "energetic exploration," "defensive aggression," "behavioral inhibition," and "calm exploration." Factors 1 and 2 were negatively correlated with age; on average, females had higher scores for Factor 2. "Energetic exploration" was positively correlated with motility, rewards eaten and rewards dropped, while "defensive aggression" was negatively correlated with the first two of these measures. "Behavioral inhibition" was negatively related to motility and to space covered. Multiple regression analysis showed that levels of 5-HIAA, as well as levels of HVA, were positively correlated with Factor 1 ("energetic exploration"), while levels of MHPG were positively correlated with Factor 4 ("calm exploration"). In the third study presented in this thesis, we extracted four interpretable behavioral dimensions from a jungle-gym novelty testing exposure in adolescent monkeys. In order of decreasing proportional variance, the behavioral dimensions were interpreted as "confident," "cautious", "exploratory" and "defensive aggression." A second-order factor analysis of the individual scores derived from this novel environment paradigm, together with factor scores from the earlier nursery novelty test, yielded four higher-order reactivity traits ("exploratory," "confident-to-inhibited," "defensive," and "cautious"). Thus the response to novelty was both conceptually and statistically replicated at two time points, providing initial evidence for continuity and stability of behavioral traits from late infancy to adolescence. In summary, the work presented in this thesis validates the hypothesis that interpretable behavioral traits can be identified in young vervet monkeys, using primary behavioral scores; provides initial evidence that the traits observed as a result of challenge tests are stable across developmental time (juvenile to adolescent); and lays the foundation for future studies of the relationship between these behavioral traits and psychopathology, as well as studies of the genes related to each of the behavioral traits.</description><creator>Desbiolles, Caroline.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Cercopithecus aethiops -- Behavior -- Saint Kitts and Nevis -- Saint Kitts.</subject><title>Behavioral traits in vervet monkeys : a longitudinal study of four successive birth cohorts</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x633f4845.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f4752m48c</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2r36v208n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Helper-dependent adenovirus vector-mediated full-length dystrophin expression in muscle leads to significant mitigation of the dystrophic phenotype of the mdx mouse. However, dystrophin, as a neoantigen, elicits antibody formation. As an alternative approach, we evaluated gene transfer of full-length murine utrophin, a functional homologue of dystrophin that is normally present only at the neuromuscular junction. A single injection into the mdx mouse tibialis anterior muscle with a helper-dependent adenovirus vector encoding utrophin provided very good transduction, with 58% of fibers demonstrating sarcolemmal utrophin expression in the neonatally injected mice while 35% utrophin positive fibers were found in mice injected in adult age. The presence of utrophin prevented extensive necrosis in the neonates (improved centronucleation index), halted further necrosis in the adults and led to restoration of sarcolemmal expression of dystrophin associated proteins up to 1 year post-injection. Marked physiological improvement was observed in both neonates and adults. Neither increased humoral nor cellular immune responses were evident. However, there was a time-related decline of the initial high utrophin expression. Although viral DNA persisted in animals that were injected in the neonatal stage, viral DNA levels decreased in muscles of mice injected in the adult age. These results demonstrate that although utrophin gene transfer leads to amelioration of the dystrophic phenotype, the effects are not sustained upon loss of utrophin expression. As the level of utrophin expression may dictate the extent of recovery from the dystrophic phenotype, we hypothesized that the delivery of a greater amount of utrophin would improve upon the initial results and further alleviate the dystrophic pathology. Through the use of higher titer adenovirus preparations, and pre-treatment of the mdx muscle with the histone deacetylase inhibitor, Trichostatin A, an increase in the initial and long-term transduction levels was achieved. This increased transduction had a significant effect on measured parameters such as serum creatine kinase levels, distribution of fiber diameter size and force generation. These results suggest that a critical determinant of the efficacy of utrophin gene transfer is the level of utrophin expression per fiber that is achieved during the initial transduction period. In conclusion, this study indicates that murine utrophin when expressed at adequate levels can successfully compensate for murine dystrophin in the mdx dystrophic model.</description><creator>Deol, Jatinderpal.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Utrophin -- genetics.</subject><subject>Adenoviridae -- genetics.</subject><subject>Dystrophin -- genetics.</subject><subject>DNA, Viral -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Muscle, Skeletal -- metabolism.</subject><title>Effects of helper-dependent adenovirus mediated full-length utrophin on dystrophic muscle : Jatinderpal Deol.</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rr1721767.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2r36v208n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7d278x91n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T20:00:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Introduction. Injection drug users (IDUs) are at high risk for infection with HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and other bloodborne viruses through the sharing of drug injection equipment. It is becoming widely recognized that the transmission of infection in this population occurs as a result of individual risk behaviours within the context of social networks. Objectives. The goal of this thesis was to identify salient features of social and drug injecting networks of IDUs that potentially facilitate infection transmission. The main objectives were: (1) to examine whether risk factors for infection depend on the characteristics of the drug network to which an IDU belongs; (2) to investigate whether risk behaviours exist between injecting partners who participate in the harm reduction practice of sterile equipment exchange; and (3) to explore the association between concordance of bloodborne virus infection status of injecting partners and drug equipment sharing. Methods. A cross-sectional study recruited active IDUs from syringe exchange and methadone treatment programs in Montreal, Canada, during 2004-2005. Results. The extent of risk factors for bloodborne infections can be differentiated by the type of network to which an IDU belongs, whereby cocaine using networks have a higher probability of risk factors than heroin networks. Despite the health benefits offered by the exchange of sterile syringes between IDUs, injecting partners remain at risk for infection through concomitant risk behaviours. Finally, perceived risk of infection appears to play a minor role in reducing injection risk behaviours since drug equipment continues to be shared between injecting partners who are discordant for HIV or HCV infection status. Conclusion. Social networks add a dimension of risk beyond an IDU's personal injection practices. Public health interventions should emphasize network-related risk factors at both the whole network and partnership levels in order to reduce injection behaviours associated with the transmission of bloodborne viruses.</description><creator>De, Prithwish.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Syringes -- virology -- Quebec.</subject><subject>Risk Assessment -- Quebec.</subject><subject>Needle Sharing -- psychology -- Quebec.</subject><subject>Substance Abuse, Intravenous -- psychology -- Quebec.</subject><subject>Quebec -- epidemiology.</subject><title>Using social networks to better conceptualize risk for bloodborne viruses among injection drug users</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/00000362m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7d278x91n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):16300</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
