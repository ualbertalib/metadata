Their typical response was to flee toward a nearby refuge while producing a trill. After a few seconds, chipmunks usually emerged and started to produce long (but sometimes interrupted) series of chucks while facing the predator. Acoustical analysis showed that the trill consisted of a rapid series of usually high pitched and variable notes while most chucks consisted of two partially overlapping components differing mainly in frequency range. No differences were observed between individuals of different categories for most antipredator responses. Various observations suggest that the trill functions to startle the predator and that the chuck deters the predator from hunting in the area.</description><creator>Bonenfant, Marjolaine.</creator><contributor>Kramer, Donald L.

Significant induction of MT by Zn supplementation was observed in mouse embryos both in vivo and in vitro. On gestational day (GD) 6.5, pregnant mice received a subcutaneous Zn injection of 0 (saline), 20 and 40 mg/kg, resulting in embryonic MT concentrations of 12.5, 54.5 and 93.4 $ mu$g/g protein, respectively, after 48h. Embryos were extracted at GD 8.5 and incubated with 0 (saline) and 15 $ mu$M Zn for 48h. There was a six-fold increase in MT expression in the Zn treatment group, resulting in MT concentration of 688 $ mu$g/g protein. Pre-induction of MT by Zn exposure was found to offer protection against subsequent exposure to ITR in vivo and in vitro. Zn injections of 40 and 20 mg/kg to pregnant mice on GD 8.5 and 9.5, respectively, alleviated fetal damage caused by three intragastric intubations of 100 mg ITR/kg on GD 10.5. Zn pre-treatment significantly increased fetal and placental masses, totally eliminated the incidence of cleft palate and lessened the frequency of post-partum mortality by 74%. Pre-treatment of GD 8.5 embryos with a 24h culture period with 15 $ mu$M Zn improved growth and totally restored normal embryonic development altered by a 24h culture with 17 $ mu$M ITR. Zn decreased the frequencies of unfused mid brain and fore brain by 100%, and the incidence of abnormal flexion by 74%. A reduction in MT concentrations was observed in groups exposed to ITR, indicating that MT may have been oxidized by ITR-derived toxic FR.

To estimate the distributions of thermal and vibration sensory thresholds in a healthy population taking into account important covariates. Methods. Sensory thresholds were measured using quantitative sensory testing for 148 volunteers free of neuropathic disease. Independent effects of age, gender, height, and skin temperature were estimated using multiple linear regression. Parametric and nonparametric methods were used to estimate the distributions of interest. Results. Significant age-related increases were observed for vibration thresholds (p $&lt;$ 0.0001) and in the foot for thermal thresholds (p $&lt;$ 0.0002). Height was significantly associated with vibration thresholds in the foot (p $&lt;$ 0.003). Selected percentiles are estimated for thermal trends in the hand. Age-adjusted continuous distributions for the remaining thresholds are presented with corrections for height where appropriate. Conclusions. Our results provide reference values for thermal and vibration sensory thresholds of a healthy population. Future patient test results may be compared with estimated age-specific percentiles to assess levels of abnormality.</description><creator>Bartlett, Gillian</creator><contributor>Abrahamowicz, Michal (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Health Sciences, General.</subject><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Estimated disributions of thermal and vibration sensory thresholds for healthy subjects</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rr1720273.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6m311r41v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1r66j320v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:12:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>DNA replication is cruciaI for the transmission of genetic information. Understanding the enzymology involved in this complex process will allow further insight into its mechanism. Experimental evidence indicates a role for DNA ligase I in DNA replication. Techniques of molecular and cellular biology and immunology were utilized in this study to further investigate DNA ligase I and clarify its involvement and interaction with other proteins in DNA replication. Immunofluorescence studies were performed to examine the intracellular distribution of DNA ligase I. Confocal analysis of indirect immunofluorescence detection of DNA ligase I using affinity purified anti-human DNA ligase I antibodies showed nuclear localization of DNA ligase I in distinct foci resembling those structures seen in detection of centres of DNA replication and other DNA replication proteins. Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed on extracts of MDBK cells to examine possible interactions of DNA ligase I with the DNA replication cofactor, PCNA; and no interactions were detected.</description><creator>Barker, Sharon.</creator><contributor>Rosenblatt, David S.

We begin the thesis with five different proofs of the Kantorovich Inequality and continue by showing that it is equivalent to five closely related inequalities due, respectively, to Schweitzer (1914), Polya-Szego (1925), Krasnosel'skii-Krei n (1952), Cassels (1955) and Greub-Rheinboldt (1959). We also examine several related inequalities which admit the Kantorovich Inequality as a special case, including the Bloomfield-Watson-Knott Inequality, for which we give a proof based on that presented by Bloomfield and Watson (1975). We also show that there appears to be a lacuna in the "brief proof" given by Yang (1990). Some statistical applications conclude the thesis with special emphasis on the efficiency of the Ordinary Least Squares Estimator in the Gauss-Markov linear statistical model.</description><creator>Alpargu, Gülhan.</creator><contributor>Styan, George (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Statistics.</subject><subject>Mathematics.</subject><title>The Kantorovich inequality, with some extensions and with some statistical applications</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nz806192c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sn00b092j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gb19f799v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:12:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>As water depth increased, fourth instar larvae of the mosquito Aedes aegypti required progressively more time to reach the pupal stage, more individuals died or were disabled and the resulting adults were significantly smaller. Water depth affected females more severely than males and the developmental time of larvae was affected more than adult mass. Time spent by fourth instar female larvae in the feeding zone during the first five hours predicted the time to subsequent pupation. Thereafter, mean feeding time was a determining factor of subsequent adult mass. With increasing water depth, both the prepupal resting period and mean time spent in the feeding zone per feeding bout increased, whereas behavior frequency (determined by an activity index) decreased.</description><creator>Audet, Alexandra M.

This was tested on bovine neutrophils by chelating extracellular and/or intracellular free Ca$ sp{2+}$ and by measuring PKC activity when the cells were stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or opsonized zymosan (OZ). Chelation of extracellular Ca$ sp{2+}$ with EGTA did not alter O$ sb2 sp{-}$ production from PMA stimulated cells. However, it did cause a 64% decrease in O$ sb2 sp{-}$ production in the neutrophils when stimulated with OZ. When intracellular Ca$ sp{2+}$ was chelated with BAPTA/AM, there was a significant decrease in O$ sb2 sp{-}$ generation following PMA activation. Yet, OZ activated cells, pre-treated with BAPTA/AM, showed an increase in the respiratory burst proportional to the chelator's concentration. Moreover, although OZ was previously shown to increase O$ sb2 sp{-}$ generation by neutrophils, no significant changes in PKC activity were observed. PMA stimulation led to an increase in PKC activity at the membrane level. Furthermore, treating the cells with calphostin C, a PKC activity inhibitor, caused a 69% decrease in O$ sb2 sp{-}$ production demonstrating the involvement of PKC in PMA-stimulated cells. However, no differences were observed between the OZ activated cells incubated with the inhibitor and the control cells. These data provide evidence that activation of NADPH oxidase can be achieved by either a PKC-dependent or a PKC-independent pathway depending on the stimulatory agent.</description><creator>Allard, Brenda.</creator><contributor>Zhao, Xin (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Dairy cattle -- Immunology.</subject><subject>Neutrophils -- Immunology.</subject><subject>Protein kinases.</subject><subject>Calcium.</subject><subject>Superoxide.</subject><title>Dependence of superoxide anion production on extracellular and intracellular calcium and protein kinase C in bovine neutrophils</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cj82k924z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6m311r424</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Animal Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9g54xk63s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:12:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>$ beta$-Hexosaminidase (Hex) is an essential lysosomal enzyme whose absence in man results in a group of disorders, the G$ sb{ rm M2}$ gangliosidoses which includes Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases. There are two major isoenzymes of Hex, Hex A ($ alpha beta$) and Hex B ($ beta beta$). Two cell types, apical and narrow cells, in the initial segment of the rat epididymis immunolocalized Hex. Principal cells of the epididymis were intensely reactive for Hex only in the intermediate zone, caput and proximal corpus regions. Clear cells were reactive in the regions of the epididymis where they were found. Electron microscopic immunocytochemistry confirmed the presence of Hex in lysosomes of all reactive cells in the epididymis and of those in Sertoli cells and interstitial macrophages of the testis. The regulation of Hex in the male reproductive tract was examined in the epididymides of rats at various ages after birth and of adult rats which were orchidectomized and treated with or without testosterone. To study the impact of absence of Hex in the male reproductive tract, mouse models of human Tay-Sachs (Hexa $-$/$-$) and Sandhoff (Hexb $-$/$-$) diseases, created through gene targeted disruption of the $Hexa ( alpha$-subunit) and $Hexb ( beta$-subunit) genes respectively, were examined.

Issues examined in the literature review include: the historical background of the practice, its cultural and religious implications, its effects on health, existing social pressures to continue or discontinue the practice and the subjective constructions of majority and minority identities, perspectives and interactions in Canada's multicultural society. For the purposes of this study majority/minority relations are explored in terms of the interactions between an immigrant community from a FC practicing country and the mainstream community in Canada. The Somali community has been chosen for this case study as the one best known to the author and as one in whose country of origin available statistics indicate a 98% prevalence rate of FC. Canadian mainstream reactions to this practice are analyzed through media reporting and statements from Somalis in Canada describing their interactions with the mainstream community on this issue. Members of the Somali community in Montreal, Quebec and Ottawa, Ontario were interviewed in order to cover as wide an area as possible, including difference in provinces. The following six themes were chosen after data analysis: the Effects of FC on Health, the Cultural Orientation of FC, Religious Beliefs Regarding FC, Social Pressures, A Sense of Differentness and Efforts to Discourage the Practice of FC. These themes are discussed with special attention being paid to 'differentness' and the mechanisms or coping skills developed to deal with this complex social phenomenon which involves opposing values, beliefs and perceptions. In its final section, the study examines the social work implications of the findings which address intercultural fears, anxieties and the dynamics of power involved in the way the FC issue has been addressed in Canada. Practice, program and policy recommendations with regard to discouraging FC practice are made at the end of the thesis. The study concludes with the observation that the debate around FC in Canada is much wider than the issue itself and that the practice has been sensationalized in a manner which has emphasized perceptions of differentness which exist in our society. No constructive dialogue will be possible around this issue until the issue of differentness is addressed, and mutual fears and anxieties evoked by the perception of differentness are dealt with in a sensitive manner, in both immigrant and mainstream communities.</description><creator>Shermarke, Marian A.

Furthermore, messages from the media, cosmetic industry and health care profession perpetuate the 'beauty myth' affecting the self-esteem of breast cancer patients. This emphasis on the aesthetic often takes precedence the grief associated with losing a body part that for many women is strongly linked to their self-concept. Based on interviews with nine breast cancer survivors in Winnipeg, Manitoba and Montreal, Quebec, three issues will be addressed: first how the cultural influences that support and perpetuate the 'beauty myth' affect breast cancer survivors; how, as a result of this issue, the grieving process is hindered and third, the experiences of women treated for breast cancer within the medical system.

This piece is inspired by the interaction of thoughts, breathing patterns, spontaneous bodily movements and sensations which can occur during the yogic practice of 'pranayam'. The work is written for flute/piccolo, oboe, clarinet, bass clarinet, bassoon, horn, trumpet, trombone, percussion, piano, four violins, two violas, two cellos, and two double basses. The piece is divided into twelve sections, clearly delineated by changes in harmony, texture, meter, and registration. As the music unfolds, seven rhythmic cells and four fixed-pitch collections provide the basis for rhythmic and harmonic development, or variation. Elements such as solo melodic lines, melodies dynamically doubled at varying intervals, polyrhythm, isorhythm, heterophony, timbral modulation, and metric modulation are used in an attempt to generate a satisfyingly rich musical experience.</description><creator>Shuebrook, Paul.</creator><contributor>Cherney, B.

It is a continuous and dynamic relationship between dwellers and their dwellings. Using houses as cultural artifacts, this thesis examines the morphogenesis of a French-Canadian neighbourhood in Montreal. Cite-Jardin du Tricentenaire was a wartime effort of a small group of entrepreneurs who had dreams of building an "ideal", French-Canadian community. Its high rate of persistence over the past fifty years--one in five households are original settlers--makes it a convenient laboratory for the study of community development. The research revolves around several themes: the planning behind the original housing; the physical evolution of the houses themselves; the experiences and perceptions of the homeowners; and the cultural and temporal context into which the housing was placed. This research establishes relationships between transformation behaviour and household characteristics, by analyzing how households adapt their housing situation to accommodate changing needs and aspirations.</description><creator>Gilliland, Jason A.</creator><contributor>Sheppard, Adrian (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Housing -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><title>Transforming the ideal : visions and revisions of housing in a French-Canadian community, 1942-1995</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g158bk20w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6w924d76q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:t722hb85r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:12:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Most developing countries have based their housing strategies on ownership. Approaches they have adopted, such as sites and services or upgrading schemes, rely basically on ownership through self-help. Yet, most of these efforts have proved inadequate to cope with the increasing demand for urban housing. In this context, informal settlements seem to provide the cheapest and more 'affordable' ownership options for the poor. Nevertheless, home ownership, even in its squatter form, demands time, investment, and long term commitment; a luxury that some households simply cannot afford. Based on qualitative research conducted in three low income barrios of informal origin, this study looks at the kind of non-ownership-oriented solutions available for the poor in Resistencia a provincial capital in Northeast Argentina. On the demand side, findings suggest that for some households rental or shared housing is the only choice. For others, on the contrary, it seems to be a matter of preference, a way to avoid the chores of ownership. On the supply side, the study unveils a fairly wide spectrum of choices, with options ranging from a bed in a house to rooming houses of up to 15 rooms. While some of the landlords are relatively wealthy, others are just as poor, or poorer than their tenants. Rental and shared alternatives are far from being 'ideal' housing solutions. Under certain conditions, however, they result in reasonable short-term options that, apart from generating extra income for small landlords, contribute to diversify the supply of cheap accommodation for poor households.</description><creator>Coccato, Marcelo.</creator><contributor>Bhatt, Vikram (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Squatter settlements -- Argentina -- Resistencia.</subject><subject>Housing -- Argentina -- Resistencia.</subject><subject>Poor -- Housing -- Argentina -- Resistencia.</subject><title>Alternatives to home ownership : rental and shared sub-markets in informal settlements, Resistencia, Argentina</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/qb98mh557.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t722hb85r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2j62s6849</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:12:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The single-parent family is an established household form in North American and Western European societies, yet today's homes are often built and marketed for the two-earner household. Inadequate and unaffordable housing is a source of daily stress in the lives of single parents. This thesis investigates the problems and concerns of the female single parents described in the literature, and reviews selected examples of single-parent housing projects developed in North America and Europe. A comparison is made with a particular group of female single parents living in the Point St. Charles neighborhood of Montreal. A review of the difficulties faced by this group is provided, particularly their housing concerns and the types of housing available to them. A brief historical overview of Point St. Charles is given so that the reader may better understand the group of female single parents surveyed. An analysis of the survey results reveals that although many of the problems and concerns of single parents described in the literature are similar to those identified in the present survey, few generalizations can be made about their housing problems.</description><creator>Bourianova, Ioulia.</creator><contributor>Sijpkes, Pieter (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Single-parent families -- Housing.</subject><subject>Women -- Housing.</subject><subject>Point St. Charles (Montréal, Québec)</subject><title>Housing of female single-parent families with special reference to Point St. Charles</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3b591b43k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2j62s6849</identifier><degree><name>Master of Architecture</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Architecture</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pz50gz15z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:12:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis will explore the various legal, administrative and ethical issues arising out of the situation in which nurse is HIV-positive or has AIDS.

The purpose of this thesis is to establish a legal framework to apply to GPS-related claims against the United States, primarily against the Air Force as operator of the system. Part I consists of three chapters. Following an introductory chapter, Chapter II describes the system and the general characteristics of GPS. Chapter III outlines the military uses of the system and the increasing and evolving civilian uses. Part II discusses the liability ramifications of providing GPS services for civilian use. Chapter IV provides the statutory bases for the U.S. government's traditional role in regulating civil aviation and maritime navigation. Chapter V analyzes the applicable domestic law under the existing statutes waiving the sovereign immunity of the United States, and Chapter VI looks at liability under international law. Chapter VII then draws some general conclusions as to how the existing law may apply to the government in regulating GPS use and operating the system itself.</description><creator>Rockwell, Jeffrey A.</creator><contributor>Vlasic, Ivan (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Law.</subject><subject>Political Science, General.</subject><title>Liability of the United States arising out of the civilian use of the global positioning system</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c247dv179.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0z708z88z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3t945s87q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:12:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Powerful forces are transforming the air transport industry's structure. Airline deregulation, privatization, competition and globalization are forcing carriers and regulatory authorities to re-examine historically accepted beliefs. These developments are occurring within the broader context of States pursuing political and economic interdependence and free trade. As such, many nations have abandoned policies that protected specific industries from competition. Instead, countries the world over seek to enhance competition and increase consumer welfare through greater reliance on the marketplace. As governments relinquish their economic control over many industries, business's seek opportunities worldwide. Civil aviation regulation is based upon the rule that each and every airline must be owned and controlled by a single State, or its nationals. True multinational airline companies are illegal. Thus, to gain the benefits associated with large scale operations and to better serve their customers, airlines are circumventing this restrictive rule through cross-border alliances. Alliances are taking international co-operation to heights previously unknown. Carriers are rapidly integrating their operations and functioning as single economic units offering seamless air services. From such assimilations emerge de facto multinational airlines. The global political and economic environments within which civil aviation functions have been radically altered in recent years. Air transport economics have also changed significantly since aviation's current regulatory framework was created in 1944. This increasingly dynamic industry is rapidly evolving beyond the existing legal regime based as it is upon strictly national carriers. This thesis argues that regulatory authorities must act now and eradicate the anachronistic nationality rule. Permitting multinational airline ownership would eliminate the anti-competitive and highly restrictive bilateral exchange of air traffic rights, bring about free trade in air services and increase consumer benefits.</description><creator>Humele, Peter Francis</creator><contributor>Janda, Richard (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Business Administration, Management.</subject><subject>Law.</subject><subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</subject><subject>Transportation.</subject><title>The withering of foreign ownership restrictions and the rise of competition in the North American Airline Industry</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7s75df574.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3t945s87q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Air and Space Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gq67jt24t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:12:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Telecommunications, drawing by the technological innovation, are nowadays part of an important movement of reform in different countries, and mainly in the members State of the European Community. France is not an exception, and is prepared to liberalise step by step the telecommunications market, in taking into account the public service and the social pressure on the public operator's privatisation, France Telecom. This thesis analyses the place of competition in the new French telecommunications market and its link with the strong State tradition. The French market rule are thus analysed in compliance with the European Competition law and directives which apply to the sector, with references to the situation occurring in US, Canada and Europe. This thesis gives thus a clear picture of what could still be considered as a barrier to the free exercise of competition by the new French operators, the European and foreign operators. In conclusion, the French government in its way to liberalisation, have to let France Telecom privation being achieved and add more transparency to its own relationship with the public operator, in order to establish a clear competitive environment.</description><creator>Disdier, Karine</creator><contributor>Janda, Richard (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1996</date><subject>Political Science, Public Administration.</subject><subject>Mass Communications.</subject><subject>Law.</subject><title>La problématique des télécommunications ou la place de la concurrence dans le mouvement français de libéralisation</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d504rn33k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gq67jt24t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1c18dh76h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:12:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A review of the literature strongly suggests that poor family dynamics play a critical role in an adolescent's choice of suicide.

The composer chose this particular instrumentation because of his conviction that percussion and electronic/digital instruments are the most powerful sources of fresh and innovative sound matter that have appeared during this century. This choice also allowed him to challenge the development of a new and consistent rhythmic syntax derived from the internal structure of percussion instruments, which in turn made it possible to establish solid ties between the sound itself and the musical syntax that rules its organization. Since different tempi are often used simultaneously in Territorios, the performance of the piece requires a set of computer-generated click-tracks carrying individual pulse lines; hearing these pulses through headphones, the performers are able to play the piece in precise tempo.</description><creator>Budón, Osvaldo, 1965-</creator><contributor>Lanza, A.

The aim of this thesis is to show that it is not a necessity but rather a source of confusion for the Swiss legal system to have special remedies for breach of warranty. General contract remedies could very effectively and rationally compensate buyers for breaches of quality warranties. To achieve this aim this study starts by analysing the historical reasons for the adoption of special warranty remedies. In its second half it compares each warranty remedy found in the Swiss Code of obligations with its equivalent in three recent legal systems: Quebec law, the Uniform Commercial Code of the United States and the United Nations 1980 Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.</description><creator>Wharton, Nathalie</creator><contributor>Crepeau, Paul Andre (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1995</date><subject>Law.</subject><subject>Political Science, International Law and Relations.</subject><title>The buyer's contractual remedies and breach of quality warranty remedies : a comparative analysis of Swiss law and modern law systems</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><rights>© Nathalie Wharton, 1995</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1c18dh77s.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bc386m432</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k930c0258</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-20T21:12:35Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Following the extensive use of ballistic missiles in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, there has been a renewed emphasis within the United States to develop and deploy anti-ballistic missile defenses.

The thesis begins with a review of the development of ballistic missiles and the systems designed to defend against them. Next an analysis of the ABM Treaty is offered, including its differing interpretations. The Treaty's legal restrictions are then applied to current ABM defensive systems in various stages of research and development.

This has led to calls for a new approach. In view of the links between the protection of the environment and the protection of human rights, one such approach has been to focus on the development of international human rights law concepts and mechanisms to address environmental concerns. This thesis undertakes a critical assessment of a human rights approach to environmental protection, with the aim of suggesting ways in which it could realistically contribute to the protection of the global environment. I consider how the environment may be protected both through the application of presently accepted human rights and through the establishment of a new human right in relation to the environment. I highlight the objections that are raised from both a human rights perspective and an environmental perspective and examine the substantial conceptual and practical difficulties that are encountered. I ultimately attempt to show that although a human rights approach has serious limitations and is unlikely to fulfill the aspirations of its promoters, it does have modest value as one strand of a much wider strategy for environmental protection under international law.</description><creator>Short, David, 1972-</creator><contributor>Toope, Stephen J.
