The beams were symmetrically loaded at the third points of a central span with a loaded overhang at each end to simulate the effects of continuity. A study of the cracking pattern, the deflected form of each beam and the stresses in the main and web reinforcements was made. The results were compared to both code requirements and theories presented by other investigators. As a result of this study it is shown that the strength of beams in shear can only be increased by shear reinforcement up to a limiting value. A modified hypothesis, as an explanation for the mechanism of shear failure, is presented.</description><creator>Faris, Mohammed. A.</creator><contributor>Harris, P.

Forty-five pyrrhotite and fifty-two sphalerite determinations were made taken from various samples. Out of these, both geothermometers were used in 18 specimens. In most cases both values were reasonably close. Only four specimens showed greater difference for the two geothermometers than 56°C, the mean difference being 17°C. The temperature values for pyrrhotite range from 350° to 484°C, of that of sphalerite from 370° to 538°C. Using these values, isotherms were drawn throughout the orebodies based on the sphalerite data. The pyrrhotite values did not show any apparent systematic variation. The sphalerite isotherms coincide with the down-dip trend of the principal ore zones. No significant change in deposition temperatures is shown with depth. The thermal gradients are steepest laterally. "Hot spots" in the major ore zones may indicate channel-ways through which mineralizing solutions travelled.</description><creator>Erdosh, George.</creator><contributor>Clark, L.

Clues to the etiology of hypertensive vascular disease have accumulated at a steadily increasing rate but a satisfactory answer, which had seemed so near in a number of occasions, has repeatedly receded from the grasp of hopeful investigators. The participation of the kidney in the maintenance of increased systemic arterial pressure has been intimated since the observations of Tigerstedt and Bergman in 1898 (1) and the classical experiments of Goldblatt in 1934 (2). Today a vast amount of experimental and clinical data attest to the fact that the kidney is in some way concerned in the pathogenesis of arterial hypertension (3-5).</description><creator>Dyrda, Ibor.</creator><contributor>Genest, J.

It is a binaphthoquinone consisting of two identical moieties joined at the 3-position (I). Analytical data and spectral studies established the formula as (C15H11O6)2. The monomeric unit has one methoxyl, one hydrogen bonded phenolic hydroxyl, a CH3-CH(-O-)-CH2-Ar group, and one aromatic proton. Reduction gave a hydrogen-bonded quinol, as evidenced by the lowering of the absorption band of the carbonyl from 1716 cm-1 to 1658 cm-1. This carboxyl is part of a lactone group, since the barium salt of the pigment exhibited bands typical of a carboxylate anion.</description><creator>Day, William. C.</creator><contributor>Just, G.

The problem arose initially through an interest in the process of personnel selection, but is here extended to the perception of persons and objects generally. The question of the influence of preliminary decisions in personnel selection was raised through consideration of a study by Springbett (1954, 1958). In that work, interviewers recorded their impressions of applicants at intervals before the completion of the selection procedure, that is, before all information about the applicant had been introduced.</description><creator>Crowell, Areta.

The electron energy (8.5 Mev) and peak beam current (&gt;200 ma.) meet the design specifications. The design and construction procedures are described, and the techniques and results of various performance tests are given. A simplified explanation of magnetron frequency skipping, ascribed to long-line effect, is given. The thesis appendix gives a discussion of transverse accelerator orbits, and describes an approximate method of evaluating the required focusing field.</description><creator>Crawford, John.

R. J. Lindsay and V.A. Vanoni, and especially taking into consideration the probable errors which are relatively large when compared to the variations in turbidity determined, it was concluded that future investigations should be carried out in such a manner as to reduce the probable errors to a minimum. Since the research of R. J. Lindsay was directly concerned with water intakes, and since his conclusions were based on a great many more observations than those of Mr. Vanoni, it may be assumed that his conclusions are more likely to be correct for this specific case, and an attempt should be made to verify them.</description><creator>Cosgrove, William.

The election was in many ways unique in that no issue of national interest was convincingly brought before the electorate. The electoral battle hinged therefore, not so much upon the subjects debated in Parliament and in the press but upon local, provincial, and regional considerations. The first four chapters investigate the background of the 1908 campaign, analyzing the position of the two political parties and examining the outstanding political issues of the years which immediately preceded the election.</description><creator>Copp, John.

In spite of the five hundred miles of ocean which separated them, the difference of age, and of experience, they were to find much in common between themselves and between their realms. James V, King of Scotland, was an infant of one year in his nursery among the bleak dark walls of a Scottish castle. Faction and jealousy surrounded this infant whose father, James IV, had been killed on the blood-soaked field of Flodden.</description><creator>Cooper, Stephen. D.</creator><contributor>Reid, W.

The upper layer is physically similar to that encountered in the Arctic Ocean and is typical of conditions recorded in M'Clure Strait and on the Arctic continental shelf. Below the depth of 200 metres, water characteristics are identical to those observed in Baffin Bay. Baffin Bay water intrudes into Lancaster Sound and is defined as far west as Prince Regent Inlet. Analyses, using two T-S techniques, are carried out to show that water of Baffin Bay characteristics occurs at all sampling positions below 250 metres in the eastern end of the Parry Channel and the equivalent thickness of this influx is of the order of 200-400 metres.</description><creator>Collin, Arthur.

Basic premises of syndicalism are analyzed and compared with contemporary socialist interpretations of class struggle and social revolution. The comparison demonstrates a substantial disparity of approach to these two problems. Theoretical links between Sorel's views and principles of collective anarchism are discussed. Considerable similarity is found between Bakunin’s and Sorel's approaches to political solutions and Proudhon's and Sorel's views on moral issues.</description><creator>Cieplak, Tadeusz.

Many groups of investigators and clinicians have been interested in its etiology, its physiopathology and its treatment. The first suggestion that the kidneys might be responsible for this disease entity came from Richard Bright in 1836,and it was the result of a remarkable clinical acumen. In 1898, Tigerstedt and Bergman injected crude saline extract of rabbit kidney into anesthetized rabbits and observed a prolonged rise in blood pressure; they named this unknown pressor principle “rennin”.</description><creator>Chretien, Michel.</creator><contributor>Genest, J.

The term enteritis applies to any inflammatory condition of the small intestine, but is used frequently to refer to any pathological condition of the digestive tract. The phenomenon, which is the common sequel to different kinds of adverse stimuli is an inflammation of the mucous membrane of the gastro-intestinal tract. Diarrhea which is a symptom, rather than a disease by itself, is a consequence of the inflammation of the alimentary tract brought about by any type of irritant of chemical, dietary, or microbial origin. Specific microorganisms are thought to be the cause of infectious types of diarrhea but the relationship is not completely understood.</description><creator>Chopra, Shivdarshan.
