Experiments were carried out in a Pyrex tube having a 5 cm inside diameter and a length of 1.2 meters. The dust dispersion system in the present experiment has been demonstrated to produce a laminar flow with uniform dust concentration. It is observed that the propagating flame exhibits a truly laminar character of propagation. Propagation and quenching of dust-air flames were measured for aluminum dust for a relatively wide range of dust concentration. It was observed that the process of the dust flame propagation in the tube can be divided into three different stages: laminar flame, oscillating flame and turbulent accelerating flame. During the first stage, the flame propagates with approximately constant speed and the flame is laminar. This stage is about 1/3 to 1/2 of the tube length and the shape of the flame front during this phase is close to the usual parabolic shape. In the second stage, flame starts to oscillate. Bright regular flashes alternate with stages when the flame is almost invisible. The third stage of the flame propagation can be observed only if the dust concentration is close to or higher than stoichiometric. The quenching distance and flame velocity of an aluminum dust flame under different initial oxygen concentrations and with different inert gases such as helium and nitrogen were also measured. When the amount of the initial oxygen concentration decreases, both the quenching distance and the lean limit increase, while the flame velocity decreases. On the other hand, after using helium as the inert gas of the mixture, it was observed that the whole value of the quenching distance, the lean limit, and the flame velocity increase. However, the objective is to understand the mechanism of the dust flame propagation. Theoretical models have also been developed to correlate the data to achieve a better understanding of the propagation mechan</description><creator>Bidabadi, Mehdi</creator><contributor>Lee, J. H. S.

(2) Given that an object can be built using a particular process, what is the best way to construct the object? The latter question gives rise to many different problems depending on how best is qualified. We address these problems for two complimentary categories of manufacturing processes: rapid prototyping systems and casting processes. The method we use to address these problems is to first define a geometric model of the process in question and then answer the question on that model. In the category of rapid prototyping systems, we concentrate on stereolithography, which is emerging as one of the most popular rapid prototyping systems. We model stereolithography geometrically and then study the class of objects that admit a construction in this model. For the objects that admit a construction, we find the orientations that allow a construction of the object. In the category of casting processes, we concentrate on gravity casting and injection molding. We first model the process and its components geometrically. We then characterize and recognize the objects that can be formed using a re-usable two-part cast. Given that a cast of an object can be formed, we determine a suitable location for the pin gate, the point from which liquid is poured or injected into a mold. Finally, we compute an orientation of a mold that ensures a complete fill and minimizes the number of venting holes for molds used in gravity casting processes.</description><creator>Bose, Prosenjit.</creator><contributor>Toussaint, Godfried (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><subject>Engineering, Industrial.</subject><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Geometric and computational aspects of manufacturing processes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/02870x84j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bz60cz50s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gf06g4658</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:57:09Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The village of Villagrande Strisaili, situated in central highlands of the island of Sardinia, Italy, is the subject of this ethnographic study of economic and cultural change. In Part I, a brief historical overview reveals that the pre-war society was largely subsistence based, with shepherding providing milk and cheese to sell on the market for cash. A strict division of labour and responsibilities by sex required mutual dependency of the male and female heads of a household, and supported local notions of gender equality. Part II examines the economic basis of and the restructuring of occupational opportunities in Villagrande today. Although shepherding and subsistence production continue to be important local activities, they are no longer the dominant forms of economic production and secure positions in government offices and institutions are now the preferred occupations. The profound cultural changes of recent decades is the focus of Part III. The notion of local culture, and of a distinctive local identity, is disappearing as cosmopolitan culture becomes localized through local acceptance. Contemporary villagers now create their sense of identity in terms of a wider reality, as defined by the powerful messages of the cosmopolitan system which are efficiently disseminated to villagers through the state educational system and the ubiquitous mass media. These cultural changes have unexpected consequences on the local culture and its reproduction to future generations.</description><creator>Edelsward, L.

Since the geographic and host distribution patterns of Ixodes dammini Spielman, et al, 1979 and POW virus overlap, the potential of this tick species to transmit POW virus was explored. Transmission experiments were conducted with hamsters and rabbits which fed immature and adult ticks, respectively, from a POW-free colony. Oral infection rates in larvae and nymphs fed on POW-infected hamsters were 10% and 40%, respectively; in females fed on POW-infected rabbits, 57%. Transstadial transmission rates for nymphs exposed to POW virus as larvae, adults exposed as larvae, and adults exposed as nymphs, were 9.5%, 10% and 54%, respectively. Evidence of transovarial transmission was acquired when 2 clean hamsters feeding F$ sb2$ larvae and nymphs originally exposed to virus in the F$ sb1$ nymphal stage seroconverted to POW virus with hemagglutination inhibition titers of 80 and 5120, respectively, on week 4 post-tick-drop-off. The transovarial transmission rate was 16.6%. All developmental stages were able to transmit POW virus orally to clean hosts regardless of when the ticks were originally exposed to virus. These results indicate that I. dammini is a competent vector of POW virus under experimental conditions. Field studies are necessary to determine if the same holds true under natural conditions.</description><creator>Costero, Adriana</creator><contributor>Hill, Stewart B.

In the first part of this dissertation, a Dynamic Programming model and a solution algorithm are developed to obtain an optimal (near-optimal) production control policy. The solution algorithm is able to produce an extremely good policy under mild conditions, but is applicable only to problems with a limited number of products. For problems involving a large number of products, a heuristic algorithm based on a decomposition/aggregation scheme is then proposed. This algorithm overcomes the computational difficulty typically associated with Dynamic Programming problems with a large number of state dimensions. Computational test results are reported to show the performance of the policy generated by the heuristic algorithm. In the second part of the dissertation, the production lead time and operational cost performance of two capacity configurations are analyzed. Models are developed for each configuration to determine the amount of capacity which minimizes the total capacity acquisition and operational costs, including the inventory cost. Computational test results are presented to study the impact of problem characteristics on the superiority of each configuration.</description><creator>Qiu, Jin, 1962-</creator><contributor>Loulou, Richard (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Inventory control -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Production control -- Mathematical models.</subject><title>Production control and capacity configuration</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ht24wm23f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w9505232k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Management</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jm214r061</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:57:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis, we study computational geometry in two and a half dimensions. These so-called polyhedral terrains have many applications in practice: computer graphics, navigation and motion planning, CAD/CAM, military surveillance, forest fire monitoring, etc. We investigate a series of fundamental problems regarding polyhedral terrains and present efficient algorithms to solve them. We propose an O(n) time algorithm to decide whether or not a geometric object is a terrain and an O(n log n) time algorithm to compute the shortest watchtower of a polyhedral terrain. We study the terrain guarding problem, obtain tight bounds for vertex and edge guards and O(n) algorithms to place these guards. We study the tetrahedralization of certain simple and non-simple polyhedra (which include some special classes of solid terrains) and present efficient algorithms to tetrahedralize them. We also investigate the problem of computing the $ alpha$-hull of a terrain. Finally, we present efficient algorithms for the intersection detection and computation of Manhattan terrains.</description><creator>Zhu, Binhai</creator><contributor>Toussaint, Godfried (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Mathematics.</subject><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Computational geometry in two and a half dimensions</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/zk51vj66h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jm214r061</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9306t1141</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:57:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The extracellular culture supernatants of the white rot fungus Trametes versicolor can bleach and delignify unbleached kraft pulps, however the process is too slow for commercial application. Though at least two oxidative enzymes, laccase and manganese peroxidase (MnP) produced by this organism can catalyze a partial delignification of kraft pulp, the effect observed is small relative to that obtained with the complete fungal system. To develop a synthetic (cell-free) delignification system, other protentially important components of the culture supernatant were identified and their contributions to biobleaching and delignification were evaluated. The presence of pulp did not significantly affect the overall carbon balance of the fungus, but a number of non-volatile metabolites (oxalic, fumaric, glyoxylic and phenyllactic acids) induced by the presence of pulp were identified. In T. versicolor 52J, the secretion of manganese peroxidase (MnP), and cellobiose:quinone oxidoreductase (CBQase) enzymes were inducible by pulp whereas cellulase and laccase were not. Several low molecular weight metabolites secreted by T. versicolor functioned as effective Mn(III) complexing agents at their physiological concentrations and promoted MnP activity. Two distinct CBQase proteins are secreted by T. versicolor 52J, CBQase 4.2 a a 113kDa homodimer containing both heme and flavin cofactors and CBQase 6.4, a 48 kDa monomer with a flavin cofactor only. Superficially, these enzymes appear very similar to the cellobiose oxidase (CBO) and CBQase reported in Phanerochaete chrysosporium. CBQase 4.2 was shown to reduce insoluble manganese dioxide to its soluble Mn(II) and Mn(III) forms with the concommitant oxidation of cellobiose. The sugar acids formed by CBQase could function as effective complexing agents for Mn(III),and complement the Mn(II) to Mn(III) oxidation activity of MnP. It is proposed that a redox cycling of lignin molecules by certain fungal oxidative and reductive enzymes occurs during delignification and that this cycling ultimately promotes net lignin degradation. A redox cycle wa established between T. versicolor CBQase and laccase which allowed the O$ sb2$ comsumption rate of laccase to remain at a constant level and the total O$ sb2$ consumption by the enzyme was much treater than if the substrate were incubated with laccase alone. A new assay for CBQase based on the ability of this enzyme to reduce the radical intermediates formed during laccase-mediated chlorpromazine oxidation was developed. A redox cycle for these two enzymes was established using both model substrates like CPZ, and with a kraft lignin preparation. CBQase inhibited the formation of polymeric material by laccase; however no evidence was found indicating that cycling with these two enzymes favors depolymerization of kraft lignin. However, the alkali extractability of residual lignin in kraft pulp was increased by a sequential treatment with MnP followed by CBQase.</description><creator>Roy, Brian Paul Patrick</creator><contributor>Archibald, Frederick S.

This educational approach is open-ended, creative and child-centred. This study explores the integrative drama/theatre process in two projects implemented in a regular high school in Montreal. Subjects for the study were 30 students from the school. The 17 students in the integrative drama project were from grade seven, and the 13 students in the integrative theatre project were from grade eleven. Three of the students in each project had disabilities and had had a significant portion of their previous education in segregated schools. A variety of qualitative and quantitative data gathering instruments were incorporated into the design of each project in order to observe and record what happened. Data analyses suggest that both projects were effective in promoting the acceptance of students with disabilities by their non-disabled peers, and in providing students with disabilities experience and confidence working in integrated environments. The integrative theatre project seemed more successful than the integrative drama project. Student age, program content, teacher style and experience, the level of student social interaction skills and time management were found to be significant factors in influencing the relative effectiveness of the integrative drama/theatre process in these projects. The implication of these results, the study's limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed.</description><creator>Richard, Ron J.</creator><contributor>Mager, G. C.

The original data set is the Marine Environment Data Service (MEDS) archived data and is supplemented by a subset of the National Oceanographic Data Centre (NODC) data from J. Reid and by the 1980s additional data of Fukumori and Wunsch (1991). The objective analysis scheme is a modification of that used by Levitus (1982) and uses 37 vertical levels. The scheme is used to calculate the climatological mean (1910-1989) temperature and salinity fields for the summer and the warm and cold seasons. Inverse methods are then applied to these new density fields in order to determine the transport and circulation during these periods. A study of the seasonal and interdecadal variations of the ocean transport and circulation is also presented. The interdecadal analysis is based on temperature and salinity fields analyzed for the warm season of the 1950-1964 and 1965-1981 periods.</description><creator>Reynaud, Thierry H.</creator><contributor>Weaver, Andrew (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Physical Oceanography.</subject><title>Dynamics of the Northwestern Atlantic Ocean : a diagnostic study</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/tm70mx438.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7m01bn68x</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2r36v049g</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:57:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis argues that in the De Rerum Natura of Lucretius Shelley found an insight into the role of contingency in physical and historical process which allowed him to go beyond the limitations of an intellectual inheritance divided between post-Kantian Romanticism and the sceptical revolutionary Enlightenment. This insight entails radical implications for our understanding of the political role of the literary text. Shelley conceives society in evolutionary terms, making poetry a revolutionary clinamen (or mutation) in the iterative cycles of social reproduction. Models drawn from contemporary chaos theory help us to understand how this entropic tendency to disorder can work simultaneously as a negentropic motor of social innovation. Building on the work of Michel Serres, who demonstrates that Lucretius anticipates the recent scientific interest in "determinate indeterminacy," this thesis shows that Shelley's understanding of historical process and the role of the poet in social reproduction has anticipated some of the implications of contemporary "chaos science" in ways that suggest models for the general application of this new paradigm of contemporary scientific thought to literary and political issues.</description><creator>Roberts, Hugh</creator><contributor>Heppner, Christopher (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Shelley, Percy Bysshe, 1792-1822 -- Sources</subject><subject>Lucretius Carus, Titus.

In the deep basin ($&gt;$4000 m), Strachan, Ricinus West and adjacent buildups have similar depositional facies, but have experienced different diagenetic processes that affected their reservoir characteristics. The most important diagenetic alteration is dolomitization that partially to completely replaced the original limestone buildups. Replacement dolomitization occurred at shallow depths near 500 m, indicated by petrographic and geologic relationships. The dolomitizing fluid was probably modified Upper Devonian seawater, as suggested by trace element concentrations and $ sp{87}$Sr/$ sp{86}$Sr ratios (0.7083 to 0.7092). These replacement dolomites have similar petrography and geochemical signatures as those in buildups along the Rimbey Meadowbrook reef trend. The presence of similar replacement dolomites over such a broad extent suggests that they formed from similar fluids during a regional to basin-wide event. Distribution of pore types is controlled by depositional facies, whereas permeability is controlled by diagenetic processes, especially dolomitization. At depths $&gt;$4000 m dolostones have higher porosities and permeabilities than limestones because the dolostones are more resistant to pressure solution. Bitumen is observed to decrease permeability in the upper part of the reservoirs. Later thermal sulphate reduction (TSR) related products both increased and decreased porosity and permeability in the lower part of the reservoirs. Major differences in diagenesis between the partially dolomitized Strachan buildup (hairline microfracturing) and the completely dolomitized Ricinus West and adjacent buildups likely resulted from the completely dolomitized buildups being connected to a regional fluid conduit system along the west margin of the Cooking Lake platform underlying the Rimbey Meadowbrook reef trend. Hairline microfractures filled with bitumen are abundant in the Strachan buildup. Subhorizontally, randomly and radially oriented microfractures crosscut all sedimentary and diagenetic phases. Overpressuring caused by the thermal cracking of crude oil to gas during burial and Laramide compression best explains their origin and distribution.</description><creator>Marquez C., Xiomara M.

These phosphoproteins were not detected in subcellular fractions enriched in plasma membranes, endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, coated vesicles and cytosol. Although the same phosphoproteins were also found in a mixed Golgi-endosome fraction (Gi), they were not found in endosome-free, highly purified Golgi fractions and were exclusively restricted to endosomes containing internalized horseradish peroxidase as determined by the diaminobenzidine shift protocol, therefore these phosphoproteins are unique to endosomes. Further characterization studies showed the 48-kDa protein was phosphotylated on threonine and the 35 and 31 kDa proteins were phosphorylated on serine residues. None of them were N-glycosylated. The endosomal protein kinase was independent of Ca$ sp{2+},$ cyclic nucleotide and phospholipids and was inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). Both ATP and GTP were phosphate donors, and ATP and GTP phosphorylated identical endosomal phosphoproteins as determined by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Because the phosphorylation was not inhibited by heparin, the corresponding kinase may not be casein kinase II. We also observed that upon in vivo administration of saturating dose of EGF, the in vitro phosphorylation activity of the 48, 35, 31 kDa proteins decreased. The endosomal specific membrane phosphoproteins may mediate phosphorylation dependent processes in endosomes in addition to serving as novel markers for the organelle.</description><creator>Lei, Xia</creator><contributor>Bergeron, J.

Traditional methods in computer vision for inferring shape-from-shading assume that surface shading depends entirely on surface orientation. In many illumination scenarios, however, shading may occur independently of surface orientation. For example, when an extended light source such as the sky casts a continuous shadow on a flat ground, the resulting shading is due to illumination variations only. In this thesis, a new approach to shape-from-shading is taken in which shading variations are attributed entirely to spatially varying illumination. This leads to a new analysis of the shape-from-shading problem, and to a new algorithm for solving it. In particular, a model of spatially varying illumination is developed which is in terms of the set of light rays in free space. This set is shown to be a four dimensional smooth manifold, called the radiation manifold. Local transformations between coordinate systems on this manifold are derived, and provide the basic mechanism of a new, parallel algorithm for inferring shape-from-shading. The scope of the thesis reaches beyond shape-from-shading, however. The radiation manifold is used to solve two other shading problems in which illumination varies across space, namely the radiosity equation in computer graphics and the shape-from-darkness problem in computer vision. The thesis thus provides a unifying framework in which a variety of shading problems may be understood and solved.</description><creator>Langer, Michael S.</creator><contributor>Zucker, S. W.

It has short snout and elongated temporal openings resembling the European pachypleurosaurid Dactylosaurus. Unlike all the other sauropterygians, the parietal opening is anteriorly positioned. The neck is long and flexible. The body is rigid and the bones are pachyostotic. It has two or three sacral vertebrae. The most striking feature of Keichousaurus is its broad ulna. The entire forelimb has the outline of a paddle or an oar, and may have functioned like one. There is noticeable sexual dimorphism, as is the case for Alpine pachypleurosaurids. The growth of the humerus is highly positive allometric, indicating an important role of the forelimb in locomotion. The horizontal orientation of the pectoral girdle indicate that Keichousaurus, as well as other pachypleurosaurids, was not a subaquatic flyer. Instead, a drag-based regime was followed in locomotion. The symmetrical rowing of the forelimbs precludes lateral undulatory movement of the body. However, vertical undulation is theoretically possible. The reassessment of the phylogenetic position of Keichousaurus hui confirmed that it is a member of the monophyletic group Pachypleurosauroidea.</description><creator>Lin, Kebang</creator><contributor>Carroll, Robert L.

Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei LLG and Lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus S93 were examined for extra- and intra-cellular proline-specific peptidase activities. Both strains showed strong activity for x-prolyl dipeptidyl peptidase and proline iminopeptidase but had weak activities for prolidase, prolinase, and post proline endopeptidase. Histochemical staining of crude enzyme extract from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei LLG with different substrates revealed a distinct protein band for x-prolyl dipeptidyl peptidase as well as for proline iminopeptidase. The growth kinetics showed that the intracellular proline-specific peptidases increased gradually at the beginning of the exponential phase and reached a maximum at the beginning of stationary phase. Storage stability of x-prolyl dipeptidyl peptidase and proline iminopeptidase in crude extract, with and without stabilizers showed no significant loss in activity of these two enzymes at 4$ sp circ$C for 9 days without adding any stabilizers. The levels of x-prolyl dipeptidyl peptidase, proline iminopeptidase, and post proline endopeptidase activities of cells grown in whey did not vary markedly from cells grown in MRS broth. X-prolyl dipeptidyl peptidase and proline iminopeptidase were purified from crude cell-free extract of Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei LLG by Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) equipped with ion-exchange and gel-filtration columns. X-prolyl dipeptidyl peptidase was found to be a serine-dependent enzyme with molecular mass of 79 kDa. The pH and the temperature optima by the purified enzyme were 7.0 and 50$ sp circ$C, respectively. Proline iminopeptidase was sulfhydryl enzyme with molecular mass of 46 kDa. The maximum enzyme activity was observed at pH 7.5 and 40$ sp circ$C. This is the first report describing the purification and characterization of x-prolyl dipeptidyl peptidase and proline iminopeptidase from Lactobacillus casei to homogeneity. The debittering of tryptic digests from $ beta$-casein by x-prolyl dipeptidyl peptidase was studied by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The results showed that two bitter peptides (f53-97 and f03-209) containing X-Pro-Y-Pro in their amino acid residues were completely hydrolyzed and many other peptides with high hydrophobicity were decreased in peak area. The addition of purified x-prolyl dipeptidyl peptidase on bitter enzyme-modified cheese (EMC) also showed that at least one bitter peptide with X-Pro-Y derived from $ alpha$-casein hydrolysis was removed.</description><creator>Habibi-Najafi, Mohammad B.

A general form describing the intensity distribution of a Bragg peak in reciprocal space is derived. The dynamical streaks associated with a Bragg peak and the width of the resolution function under the Gaussian approximation are studied in detail. The theory of absolute integrated intensity measurement by means of a triple-crystal diffractometer is developed. X-ray diffraction with synchrotron sources and multi-reflection collimators are studied briefly. Most aspects of the theory are verified by experiments. Extensive measurements are conducted in vast 2$ theta$ range to test the width distribution of the resolution function. The streak structure in reciprocal space is also measured experimentally. The absolute integrated intensity measurements are conducted over a GaAs single crystal sample. All these results agree reasonably well with the theory. As an example of application, the atomic concentration difference of Ga and In atoms in Ga$ rm sb{0.5}In sb{0.5}$P superstructure is obtained through the absolute integrated intensity measurement, and the correlation length of the superstructure is estimated, with the help of Hendricks-Teller's model. X-ray reflectivity is a special case of a Bragg peak. By using X-ray reflectivity measurements, the interface and its subsequent evolution of Ti/Fe bilayer over SiO$ sb2$ substrate under various annealing stages are studied. The electron density profiles of the structures are acquired.</description><creator>Gu, Tianqu</creator><contributor>Sutton, Mark (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Engineering, Materials Science.</subject><subject>Physics, Condensed Matter.</subject><title>The resolution function of triple-crystal X-ray diffractometer and its applications</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9g54xk528.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fj2364044</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5x21th424</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:57:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Hydrazine reacts with phthalic anhydride to give a mixture of cyclic hydrazide and N-aminophthalimide. However, the N-aminoimide is exclusively formed in high yield by the reaction of 1,8-naphthalic anhydride with hydrazine. N-aminoimides act as amines and react further with cyclic anhydrides to yield stable bisimides containing an N-N linkage. The syntheses of several bis(N-aminoimide)s from the corresponding bisanhydrides which contain the naphthalic anhydride moiety have been described. Novel high molecular weight polyimides have been synthesized by the reaction of these bis(N-aminoimide)s with cyclic dianhydrides. Most of the polymers are amorphous and are soluble in solvents such as chloroform, o-dichlorobenzene, N-methylpyrrolidinone and m-cresol. Only those polyimides having less flexible groups in their structure or containing a significant amount of perylene units show some degree of crystallinity. All of the polymers show remarkably high glass transition temperatures, as high as 455$ sp circ$C. Their 5% weight loss by thermogravimetric analysis in an atmosphere of air or nitrogen are all above 440$ sp circ$C. Most of these polymers are highly fluorescent. Their emission spectra are in the visible region and show some evidence for an excited energy transfer and molecular aggregation.</description><creator>Ghassemi, Hossein</creator><contributor>Hay, A.

A low-intensity rainfall simulator and a snowmelt simulator were developed to study soil erosion by snowmelt and/or spring rainfall on a sandy loam soil of southern Quebec. Erosive agent, land slope, thaw depth of partly frozen soil, and intensity and duration of the event were studied in the laboratory using the simulators. All these factors had significant effects on soil erosion. Sediment concentration, soil loss rate, and total soil loss increased with increasing land slope, thaw depth, and intensity, duration, and impact energy of the erosive agent. Duration showed a significant interaction with each of the other factors. interaction between thaw depth and intensity of the event was significant under both snowmelt and rainfall simulation, whereas interaction between land slope and intensity was significant under rainfall simulation, but not under snowmelt simulation. Erosive agent also interacted with each of the other factors. All these interactions increased soil loss. The presence of a frozen sublayer interacted with the other factors and greatly increased runoff, sediment concentration and total soil loss. Rainfall caused more soil loss than did snowmelt under the same conditions.</description><creator>Geng, Guoqiang</creator><contributor>Mehuyr, G. R.

To study these events, it was first necessary to determine whether HIV-1 reverse transcription first occurs in virions or in host cells. Although low levels of viral DNA as compared to viral RNA were observed in wild type virus particles, such DNA was not required for infectivity as determined by studies comparing the infectiousness of virus containing AZT chain-terminated DNA with wild-type virus. Viral DNA was produced by mature reverse transcriptase (RT) in a manner independent of the p160$ sp{gag-pol}$ precursor. Reverse transcription appears generally to occur in the host cell after virus entry, and is initiated by a host tRNA$ rm sp{lys3}$ isoacceptor species that anneals to the primer binding sequence (PBS) in the HIV-1 RNA genome. This annealing event, coupled with RT binding, primes RNA-dependent DNA polymerization and, subsequently, the first template switch. The use of tRNA$ rm sp{lys3}$, instead of a synthetic deoxyoligonucleotide to prime an endogenous in vitro HIV-1 reverse transcription reaction, increased each of processivity of RNA-dependent DNA polymerization, RNase H activity, and efficiency of template switching. Since all of the latter activities are catalyzed by HIV-1 RT, it is likely that specific interactions with tRNA$ rm sp{lys3}$ may induce a conformational change in RT. To determine the mechanism of HIV-1 inhibition by nucleoside analogs, the activity of 3$ sp prime$-hydroxyl deficient nucleoside analogs was studied in tissue culture infections of activated and quiescent CD4+ lymphocytes and in vitro using the HIV-1 endogenous reverse transcription/template switching reaction. Nucleoside analogs were found to preferentially chain terminate viral DNA immediately following the first template switch in both the host cell and in vitro. This preferential chain termination was dependent on both the processivity and pausing of reverse transcription. Increased pausing of reverse transcriptase, induced by low deoxynucleoside triphosphate concentrations or by priming reactions with dPR in place of tRNA$ rm sp{lys3}$, also increased the frequency of chain termination by nucleoside analogs occurring at pause sites.</description><creator>Arts, Eric Joseph</creator><contributor>Wainbery, Mark A.

Continuous pulp spouting is also feasible in a wedge-like vessel within certain limits of flow rate and inlet pulp consistency. Spouting hydrodynamics and particle separation behavior in both vessels were investigated for pulp fibers and recycled pulp suspensions. The minimum spouting velocity (MSV), spouting stability and the pressure drop-flow rate relationship were determined for liquid spouting of pulp fibers and of rigid particles. Liquid spouting of rigid particles is similar to gaseous spouting; pulp spouting is different. The liquid flow field in a conical spouted bed of pulp fibers is of a jet expansion type. A model for predicting the MSV for spouting pulp fibers was developed based on visual observation of the transition of the jet flow patterns in the conical vessel. Small particles including both ink and pulp fines can be elutriated from a spouted bed of a recycled pulp suspension, with little fiber loss, in both semi-batch and continuous modes using conical and wedge-like vessels, respectively. Both processes were studied using on-line measurement of the exit particle concentration. For the semi-batch process, the first order elutriation coefficient increased with the flow rate, but was about the same for all pulps. Based on the analysis of the flow field around a porous spherical particle in a shear flow, an elutriation model was developed for fine particle removal from a suspension of porous coarse particles. For the continuous operation, the particle separation mechanism and the fractional particle removal were investigated. Separation occurs by excluding fibers from the top stream, while fines are split according to the ratio of top to bottom flow rates.</description><creator>Al-Jabari, Maher</creator><contributor>Ven, T.

The ideological dynamics of ethnicity are revealed in the process of the creation and re-creation of belief in "Italian family", as a distinctive 'Italian' culture. This first separates Italians into different families and regional groups of paesani, but then brilliantly unites Italians into one group according to necessity. In political processes, various Italian associations and presidents are connected to formal politics through the mediation of Italian political brokers. The extensive construction of suburban residences created Italian economic elites and affected other sectors of the economy. Significantly, Italians attempt to keep business within Italian networks. This 'nationalistic' aspect of networks aims to maximize interests within the group. Such dynamic Italian politico-economic networks extend to the further level of formal politics in which federalist Liberals and separatist Parti Quebecois are principal rivals.</description><creator>Aramaki, Michiko</creator><contributor>Scott, Colin (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1994</date><subject>Italian Canadians -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- Ethnic identity.</subject><subject>Italian Canadians -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- Politics and government.</subject><subject>Italian Canadians -- Social networks -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><subject>Italian-Canadian women -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- Social conditions.</subject><title>Family, paesani and networks : politics and economy of Montreal Italians</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vx021h165.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sn00b0811</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anthropology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wh246t957</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:57:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We show that a twistor construction of Hitchin and Ward can be adapted to study unitons (harmonic spheres in a unitary group). Specifically, we show that unitons are equivalent to holomorphic bundles with extra structure over a rational ruled surface. This equivalence allows us to confirm the conjecture of Wood that unitons are rational. These bundles are in turn representable by monads. By interpreting the uniton construction of Ward in this setting, we are able to give an expression for unitons of 'simplest type' in terms of the monad data (three matrices) using only matrix operations. This expression yields a proof that the components of the moduli and energy levels are one and the same for unitons of 'simplest type'.</description><creator>Anand, Christopher Kumar</creator><contributor>Hurtubise, Jacques C.
