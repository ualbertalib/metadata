The characters speculate about the meaning of life and death, about good and evil. Of all Roy's writings, it is undoubtedly in Alexandre Chenevert that these searching questions are most expressly depicted. In this thesis, we will study the manner in which the romantic background of Alexandre Chenevert reflects the religious experience of post-war French Canadians. Under the guise of distorted images, the novel does, in fact, hide an abundant network of themes referring to the religious context of the 1940's-1950's. This period was marked by challenging the ecclesiastical authority. The study of Alexandre Chenevert, a genuine sociological document, will allow us to understand the role religion played in the evolution of the French Canadian society.</description><creator>Bellemare, Sylvie</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Roy, Gabrielle, 1909- Alexandre Chenevert caissier</subject><title>La notion de Dieu dans "Alexandre Chenevert" /</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/73666558c.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sq87bv68k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wm117q059</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:42:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Thule archaeological sites typically yield large quantities of well-preserved faunal remains. These remains represent a wealth of information on a wide range of activities related to Thule animal-based subsistence economies, but have only recently been subjected to the quantitative ecological analyses that have increasingly concerned archaeologists elsewhere.

While both are mixtures of trialkyl phosphine oxides, the trialkyl groups in the former have straight chains, while those in the latter have branched chains. The major variables studied were hydrochloric acid, extractant and zirconium concentrations, and phase ratio. With both reagents, zirconium is extracted rapidly. Extraction increases with increasing hydrochloric acid concentration, and zirconium is loaded as its neutral tetrachloride complex by a solvation reaction. The loaded zirconium forms a di-solvate, except at high excess extractant concentrations, where solvation numbers greater than 2 are found. At a constant total chloride concentration, the zirconium extraction level is maintained if hydrochloric acid is partially replaced by lithium chloride, provided sufficient hydrochloric acid is retained to prevent zirconium hydrolysis. Distribution coefficients decease with increasing zirconium concentration, suggesting that polymerization occurs in the aqueous phase. For given conditions, zirconium extraction into Cyanex 923 is higher than for Cyanex 925. However, loading selectivity for zirconium over other metals has not been studied. A few preliminary experiments have shown that aqueous solutions of ammonium carbonate are potential stripping agents.</description><creator>Suriyachat, Duangkamol</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</subject><title>Zirconium solvent extraction using organophosphorus compounds</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bg257g15x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pg15bg134</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7p88ch75m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:42:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Development of network quality speech coders at 16 kb/s and below is an active research area. This thesis focuses on the study of low-delay Code Excited Linear Predictive (CELP) and tree coders. A 16 kb/s stochastic tree coder based on the (M.L.) search algorithm suggested by lyengar and Kabal and a low-delay CELP coder proposed by AT&amp;T (CCITT 16 kb/s standardization candidate) are examined. The first goal is to compare and study the performance of the two coders. Second objective is to analyze the particular characteristics which make the two coders different from one another. The final goal is the improvement of the performance of the coders, particularly with a view of bringing down the bit rate below 16 kb/s. When compared under similar conditions, the two coders showed comparable performance at 16 kb/s. Issues in backward adaptive linear prediction analysis for both near and far sample redundancy removal such as analysis methods, windowing, ill-conditioning, quantization noise effects and computational complexities are studied.</description><creator>Foodeei, Majid</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Low-delay speech coding at 16 kbs and below</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ht24wk351.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7p88ch75m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:db78td244</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:42:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Analytical methods solving for the separated flow over delta wings have been based on the slender-body theory, which applies for wing geometries of small aspect ratio. The slender-body solutions are independent of the Mach number, and therefore, for supersonic flow, cannot appropriately take into account the directional propagation of disturbances. The slender-body model is attractively simple of the pressure distribution and lift prediction, but in the supersonic regime it can lead to large errors when the wing geometry is not very slender with respect to the Mach cone. In the treatment of attached flow over arbitrary wing-body combinations in supersonic flow regime, the method of Velocity Singularities based on conical motion provides a more accurate alternative over slender-body theory by considering the appropriate boundary condition of flow disturbances outside the wings. This thesis presents an extension of the method of Velocity Singularities for the analysis of the separated flow over thin delta wings.</description><creator>Pierre, Sylvain</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><subject>Engineering, Aerospace.</subject><title>Aerodynamics of wings with leading-edge flow separation in supersonic regime</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bc386k508.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/db78td244</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8g84mn31n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:42:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A distinguished class of cocycles in the local Chevalley cohomology associated with the representation of the Lie algebra of vector fields on the vector space of differential 2-forms is defined and proven to be non-zero.

We have observed that the electroporation efficiency of these plasmids depends on the location and/or the orientation of the satellite sequences within the transfected plasmid. Only one plasmid, pCFD1 containing one satellite fragment close to the neo gene, inhibited the formation of TK$ sp+$/NEO$ sp+$ transfectants. We have also shown that the instability of the TK$ sp+$ phenotype which was observed did not correlate with the presence of adjacent satellite DNA. In contrast, satellite DNA sequences within the transfected plasmid somehow interfered with the generation of stable TK$ sp+$ transfectants. Moreover, we have detected (both in nuclear and partially purified HeLa whole cell extracts) the presence of proteins that specifically bind the human 1797 bp satellite II DNA sequence. Four proteins with molecular weights of 100, 93, 77 and 34 kDa were identified and named Satellite DNA-binding protein, Sbp-1, -2, -3 and -4, respectively.

Damage onset including matrix cracks and edge delamination are predicted by using a total strain energy release rate criterion which accounts for interactive effects of matrix cracks and delamination. The analytical models for modulus degradation, matrix crack density and delamination size growth as function of fatigue stress and fatigue cycles are proposed. The proposed approach provides four choices for predicting tension-tension fatigue life and for assessing fail-safety for structures made of composite laminates. The direct relation of physical damage to fatigue life and analytical equations for calculating residual elastic moduli E$ rm{ sb1, E sb2, v sb{12}}$ and G$ sb{12}$ in terms of fatigue load and fatigue cycles are proposed. The proposed approach enables prediction of fatigue behaviour of general laminates using experimental data of a basic lay-up such as unidirectional laminate. The finite element technique was utilized to model the fatigue failure process of notched laminates. A simple example of a laminate with a central hole under tension-tension fatigue loading was performed.</description><creator>Liu, Bangyan</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Fatigue and damage tolerance analysis of composite laminates - stiffness loss, damage modellig, and life prediction</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9593tw307.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7w62f951h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7s75dd586</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:42:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>For three consecutive years, I monitored the spring stream residency and spawning of five species of fishes using a tributary stream of the Gouin Reservoir (north central Quebec). Timing of spawning of the distantly related species was different whereas the spawning activity of the closely related suckers overlapped in time and space. Intra- and inter-specific egg predation by the two sucker species was observed as well as predation by lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) on sucker eggs. Synchronisation of the spawning of the suckers may allow them to "swamp" egg predators with drifting eggs. Abundance of spawning fish was affected by water management practices in the reservoir. When water levels were low, fewer fish of all species had access to the stream possibly because of the development of rapids. The courtship behavior of the two sucker species was described and compared in the same period, to determine if behavioral isolating mechanisms which prevented hybridization existed.</description><creator>Dion, René</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Resource partitioning (Ecology) -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>White sucker.</subject><subject>Fishes -- Québec (Province) -- Ecology.</subject><subject>Longnose sucker -- Québec (Province).</subject><title>Resource partitioning in a spring spawning freshwater fish assemblage dominated by catostomids (Catostomus commersoni, C. catostomus)</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xk81jm597.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7s75dd586</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Renewable Resources</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gx41mk154</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:42:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study compares three mining taxation systems: royalty, profit tax and profitability tax, in a theoretical framework. It examines concepts and forms of taxation which are applicable to various nations, regions and/or commodities. The study first reviews the economic characteristics of the mining industry and the principles of economic rent. Then, using a computerized model of a hypothetical project, the comparative impacts of the three tax systems are determined. The following conclusions have been drawn from the study: (1) In general, taxes are a significant cost to a mining project. (2) A revenue taxation system (i.e. royalty) is easier to implement and enforce than either profit or profitability based systems. (3) The profit and profitability based systems are less discriminatory against low quality deposits and marginally profitable operations than a revenue taxation system.</description><creator>Li, Feng, 1957-</creator><contributor>Bilodeau, M.

The crucial problem resided in developing an economic framework to evaluate alternative crop rotations that would provide farmers in transition an optimal rotation plan compatible with organic farming practices. Two multi-period linear programming models were developed for that purpose, both models having different assumptions concerning effects that the transition might have on crop yield. In both transitional models, two crop rotations were selected in the optimal solution. In addition, the establishment of crop rotations was comparable for both models, and this showed that the assumed drop in yield did not have a large impact on the selection of crop rotation. Also, the results support the notion that conversion to organic agriculture had a relatively less negative effect on farm profit if the transition was done gradually.</description><creator>Forest, Jean-François</creator><date>1992</date><subject>Dairy farming -- Québec (Province).</subject><subject>Crop rotation -- Economic aspects.</subject><subject>Organic farming -- Québec (Province)</subject><title>The economics of conversion to organic agriculture : a rotational plan</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ms35t9651.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m613mz640</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Agricultural Economics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:41687j63q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:42:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A Monte Carlo simulation system was enhanced in order to analyze photon transport in tapered geometries. This system was used to evaluate the performance of new tapered collimator designs, for multi-slice positron emission tomography (MS-PET) and positron volumetric imaging systems (PVI-Systems). For each imaging modality, the performance of the new collimators was compared to those of the current collimators of choice. Collimators were evaluated based upon their: (1) trues detection efficiencies; (2) scatter detection efficiencies; (3) scatter fractions; and (4) total singles to trues events ratios. In MS-PET, collimators with a diamond-like cross section--double tapered collimators--were introduced and their performance compared to those of single tapered and cylindrical collimators. Double tapered collimators yielded better performance than single tapered ones. In PVI systems, external tapered collimators were simulated and their performance compared to those of cylindrical ones.

This paper attempts to quantify the importance of intra-industry exchange between Canada and the United States. The analysis deals primarily with measurement, but an attempt to identify the determinants of the phenomenon is also made. The results suggest that intra-industry trade represents a significant and increasing share of Canada's trade with the United States. Although part of this can be explained by idiosyncratic causes, the importance of two-way trade within manufacturing requires additional explanation.</description><creator>Justus, Martha</creator><date>1992</date><subject>United States -- Commerce -- United States</subject><subject>Canada -- Commerce -- United States</subject><title>An investigation into the level of intra-industry trade between Canada and the United States, 1968-80 /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/08612p79z.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jh343t351</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Economics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z316q2667</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:42:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Lamentations on the absence of tragic texts in the twentieth century center on the untenability of Aristotelian parameters of tragedy within a modern context. These parameters include the immediacy of the dramatic experience as a vehicle for identification with the audience and a hero fully capable of realizing the tragic truth of his existence. Curiously restrained by formal requirements postulated in antiquity, the majority of critics have neglected that modern tragedy may have shed structures no longer culturally relevant while maintaining the essence of the tragic vision. The novel has been largely ignored despite its being perfectly suited for a contemporary communication of the tragic vision. The skepticism shattering the belief that our respective destinies can be fully embodied by another is no obstacle for tragedy in the novel. Through a narrating choric figure acting as mediating consciousness, the novel provides a direct link between reader, hero, and the tragic experience. The very act of narration also sheds light on the creation of the tragic text, extending this link to the tragedian himself. The result is a three-pronged identification, (with the hero, choric figure, tragedian), through which the reader is confronted with the multifarious truths laid bare in the text. These revelations, along with a deliberate absence of closure, compel the reader into the same unending quest to complete the tragic cycle--an experience akin to the catharsis of old.</description><creator>Gauthier, Tim</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Fiction -- History and criticism</subject><subject>Heroes in literature</subject><subject>Tragedy</subject><title>The dual vision of tragedy : hero and choric figure in the tragic novel</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/nc580n74r.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z316q2667</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:z029p573d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:42:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The political popular theatre which has developed in the West since the 1960s challenges the current hegemony in Western cultures by attacking its basic models of knowledge, yet little critical attention has been paid to the dramaturgies particular to this form. An application of the Possible Worlds theory, the concept of ludic framing, and feminist "standpoint" theory to the Irish stage plays written by Margaretta D'Arcy and John Arden after they left the "legitimate" stage, shows how the dramaturgy of this theater is a critical part of its strategic challenge to the status quo. This analysis shows how D'Arcy and Arden foreground the encompassing Theatre Possible World, within which the performance takes place, in order to cast doubt on the natural character of generally accepted meanings, and to induce the audience to consciously choose the frames within which it makes sense of action.</description><creator>Graham, Catherine (Catherine Elizabeth)</creator><contributor>Suvin, Darko (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1991</date><subject>Arden, John -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><subject>D'Arcy, Margaretta -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><title>Standpoints : the dramaturgy of Margaretta D'Arcy and John Arden</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bg257g166.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/z029p573d</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5d86p153b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:42:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Undergraduates' conceptual knowledge of important concepts in a Pre-historic Archaeology course was investigated with a pre-post open-ended test procedure. Students were randomly assigned to one of three levels of a concept mapping intervention. All students were given an introductory lecture on concept mapping. Of the 124 students who completed the pre- and post-tests, students (n = 45) in the first treatment level were given a reading guide to the textbook material. Students (n = 36) in the second treatment level were given a reading guide with incorporated concept mapping questions. Treatment level three students (n = 43) were also given the concept mapping reading guides and received instructor and peer feedback on their responses to the concept mapping questions. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed that students in all three treatment levels gained in conceptual knowledge. A secondary descriptive analysis revealed that concept mapping appears to aid students in clarifying misconceptions.</description><creator>Gryspeerdt, Danielle</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Educational psychology</subject><subject>Concepts</subject><subject>Knowledge, Theory of</subject><title>The effects of concept mapping on prior knowledge and meaningful learning /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r494vm155.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5d86p153b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Educational Psychology and Counselling</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2v23vv34q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:42:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study applies Chomsky's Barriers version of government binding theory to subject clitic pronouns and subject-verb agreement processes in Somali.

The nonlinear equations of motion are derived for cantilevered pipes and for simply-supported pipes, using Hamilton's principle and the force balance method. The resulting equations are compared with previous derivations. The linearized system is first studied, to get the critical parameters corresponding to the stability boundaries, i.e. the local bifurcations. Then, the nonlinear equations are investigated, both analytically and numerically. Centre manifold, normal form and bifurcation theories are used to obtain complete bifurcation sets which provide the qualitative dynamics of the system. It is shown that chaotic motions may arise under perturbation, or when the motions are constrained by motion-limiting restraints, through calculations of the Lyapunov exponents and the construction of phase portraits, bifurcation diagrams and power spectra. This modeling is in close agreement with experimental observations.</description><creator>Semler, Christian, 1966-</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Nonlinear dynamics and chaos of a pipe conveying fluid</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/6h440t55r.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7w62f9532</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sx61dn568</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:42:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Reverse-micelles are surfactant aggregates in an apolar solvent. The surfactants, which must have two hydrophobic tails, cluster around a water core. The effects of the compositions of the solvent and the aqueous phase on water solubilization were studied for two anionic surfactants: sodium di-2-ethylhexylsulfosuccinate (AOT) and dinonylnaphthalene sulfonic acid (DNNSA). Single straight chain alkanes having 6-17 carbons, mixtures of these alkanes and branched alkanes were used as solvents. The aqueous phases consisted of salts and buffers. For AOT in straight chain alkanes, water uptake increased as the length of the chain approached 9 carbons, the length of the AOT hydrocarbon tail. As the solvent length increased further, a critical carbon number was reached above which there was no water uptake. Different buffers shifted the critical carbon number somewhat. Mixtures of straight chain alkanes behaved similar to single alkanes when compared on the basis of volume-average carbon number. Branched alkanes solubilized more water than their straight chain isomers. For DNNSA the water uptake was the same for all solvents.</description><creator>Ladanowski, Caroline</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Engineering, Chemical.</subject><title>Separation with reverse-micelles</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9306t0374.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sx61dn568</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cf95jc572</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:42:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Pickforce sensing is a method demonstrating a promising future in automating coal mining machines. The method is based on the ability to determine the vertical location of a rotary cutting machine from the force measured at the point of contact between the machine and the coal seam. A major problem that may degrade the reliability of the pickforce data is vibration and is the major concern of this study. To analyze the effects of vibration on pickforce sensing, a vibration model of the cutting process is first developed. Then, a stochastic model of the coal seam is constructed. Subsequently, the vibration model is simulated in three stages. In these stages, the machine is assumed to be cutting through three types of coal seam: homogeneous, predetermined heterogeneous, and heterogeneous stochastic model. The first stage is conducted to prove that pickforce data always contains a degree of phase shift between successive half revolutions. This eliminates the effect of repetitive or orderly vibration that may mask the pickforce data. In addition, both the first and second stages are conducted to find ways to improve the reliability of pickforce data by adjusting a few parameters within the machine. The third stage is conducted to prove that the chaotic appearance of the pickforce data does not eliminate the features that are used to determine the vertical location. The present study concludes that vibration has a minor effect, and that pickforce sensing can be improved by adjusting some parameters of the cutting machine.</description><creator>Idriss, Omar Selim</creator><date>1991</date><subject>Engineering, Mining.</subject><title>Vibration effects on pickforce sensing</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5712m774c.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cf95jc572</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qf85nc37b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:42:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Homojunctions of CuInSe$ sb2$ were fabricated by diffusing indium or bismuth into monocrystalline substrates grown by a vertical Bridgman method. The current-voltage characteristics at different temperatures were measured. The measured current-voltage data were analyzed by computer fitting using a junction model to obtain parameters. From the computer fitting results, it was confirmed that the recombination process is dominant in the current transport mechanism of the homojunctions in monocrystalline CuInSe$ sb2$. It was found that at a given voltage, the capacitance value decreased when the measuring frequency was increased. This result indicated that deep defects exist in the material. Deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) measurements were performed on all of the samples in order to investigate the deep levels. Two hole trap levels, one located at 250 $ pm$ 15 meV and the other at 520 $ pm$ 15 meV from the valence band edge, were observed in the samples treated at 200$ sp circ$C in N$ sb2$. For the sample heated at 200$ sp circ$C in air, the latter was at 850 meV. The above results suggested that O atoms may have an important contribution to the defects. The electron traps, with the energy at 182 $ pm$ 14 meV from the conduction band edge, were found on all of the samples treated in N$ sb2$ and air.</description><creator>Li, A. L.

It also addresses whether the dyad is a viable alternative to the other two. It examines the amount and type of data yielded in each condition. Comparisons are based on: (a) learners' comments, (b) learners' tests scores, and (c) objective measures (e.g., session length). Thirty-four (15 males, 19 females) McGill University undergraduate students participated in the study. Participants were instructed on how to report problems they encountered while learning from a six-page instructional unit. Results indicate that the one-to-one condition resulted in the least amount of feedback or data collected.
