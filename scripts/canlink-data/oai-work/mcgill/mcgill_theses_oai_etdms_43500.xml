Little  research has examined deviance within this group. This thesis delves into types of  deviant behaviors taking place among haredi adolescents, as well as their causes, so  that effective interventions, sensitive to the virtually unique needs of this group,  can be implemented. Theoretical definitions of deviance are examined as they relate  to this community and its emphasis on religious observance. Ultimately, deviance is  defined as matters that can distract the individual from expected levels of  religious observance. Using Urie Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Model of Human  Development, this thesis also explores the environmental factors contributing to a  rise in deviant behavior in segments of the Montreal ultra-Orthodox community. From  an analysis of data obtained from numerous interviews with community members as well  as with mental health professionals familiar with this group, four contributing  factors to the rise of deviant behavior among adolescent boys are identified. These  factors test current haredi methods of maintaining strong cultural boundaries and  may suggest that changes are necessary to cope with current challenges. The lure of  mainstream culture is a strong draw for adolescents and advances in technology allow  these individuals to easily engage in secret deviant behavior while remaining in  good standing within the community. Moreover, the rigid structure of the school day  with its long hours and intensive curriculum makes it difficult to accommodate the  needs of all students. Changes in family structure, dynamics, and composition, as  well as an increasingly stringent interpretation of religious law have also  contributed to a rise in deviance. Finally, community financial weakness is explored  as it relates to adolescence and a loss of religious identity.</description><creator>Levy, Jonathan</creator><contributor>Wright, Robin (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2004</date><subject>Deviant behavior -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- Social aspects</subject><subject>Ultra-Orthodox Jews -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- Social conditions</subject><subject>Conformity</subject><subject>Teenage boys -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- Social conditions</subject><subject>Adolescent psychology -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</subject><title>Deviance and social control among Haredi adolescent males</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/gf06g3228.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/x346d475b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:pk02cb356</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:23:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>From the establishment of the Ming to the fall of the Qing  (1368--1911), the social and cultural scene of the Chinese countryside was greatly  transformed. Lineages became the dominant social organization in many areas. Local  temples became a familiar part of the rural landscape. Local culture was  increasingly exposed to the influence of regional culture and gentry culture with  the proliferation of market towns, the development of the printing industry and the  rise of literacy. By investigating the history of ritual specialists and their  rituals in a sub-county area in southeast China, this thesis shows how these social  and cultural transformations took place and how the local population experienced  them. Lisheng or masters of ceremonies, the focus of this thesis, played and still  play an important role in the local social and symbolic life. Either along with or  in the absence of other ritual specialists, they guided the laity through ritual  procedures to communicate with ancestors, gods, and the dead. These rituals, and  also the related liturgical texts, were the outcome of social and cultural  transformations in the late imperial period. Through a detailed discussion of the  history of the three important local institutions that were closely related to  lisheng and their rituals, namely, lineages, community compacts, and temple  networks, the thesis shows the limitations of the elitist interpretation of late  imperial cultural transformations. Cultural integration and gentrification were  without doubt important aspects of these processes. However, both may have  oversimplified the complexity of the processes and exaggerate the influence of high  culture. Cultural hybridization, the process in which elements from different  cultural traditions were synthesized into a new, constantly changing cultural  mosaic, provides a multipolar, interactional, and thus more complex approach to our  understanding of cultural processes in late imperial China.</description><creator>Liu, Yonghua, 1970-</creator><contributor>Dean, Kenneth (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Temples, Taoist -- China -- Fujian Sheng</subject><subject>Taoism -- China -- Rituals.</subject><subject>Rites and ceremonies -- China -- Fujian Sheng.</subject><subject>Confucianism -- China -- Rituals.</subject><subject>Temples, Buddhist -- China -- Fujian Sheng -- History.</subject><subject>Cults -- China -- Fujian Sheng -- History.</subject><subject>China -- Religious life and customs.</subject><subject>Buddhism -- China -- Rituals.</subject><title>The world of rituals : masters of ceremonies (Lisheng), ancestral cults, community compacts, and local temples in late imperial Sibao, Fujian</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7h149q391.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pk02cb356</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of East Asian Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:4t64gn697</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:23:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis aimed to provide a knowledge base and methodologies  to help minimize electromagnetic interference (EMI) in healthcare. Two methods were  developed, for the first time, to quantify EMI risk due to radio frequency (RF)  sources in hospitals. The first method used contour maps and cumulative  distributions of field strength to compute the risk of EMI from an RF source of  known power operating near a medical device of known immunity. The second method,  "minimal separation with risk", used power law models and cumulative  distributions of the residuals from such models to compute the risk of EMI from an  RF source of known power operating near a medical device of known immunity, both  situated in a known electromagnetic environment. Field structures within a hospital were extensively  characterized using straight-line trajectories or planar surfaces, sampled  individually or in 3-dimensional arrays. Data was obtained both experimentally (850  and 1900 MHz) and through simulations (850, 1900 and 2400 MHz). Both the structure  (morphology) and the statistics of fields were characterized. Field behavior was  characterized in corridors (e.g. fields fell more rapidly near walls, but remained  unexpectedly constant near the floor) and in clay-block rooms (e.g. extensive  standing wave patterns). The methods permitted computation of the actual risk of EMI for  a given hospital electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) policy in a hospital  environment, rather than the safe-unsafe recommendations commonly recommended, even  in medical device standards. This provides a more realistic assessment of the  effectiveness of a particular hospital EMC policy. Finally, a theoretical development employing scalar theory  approach led to an approximate estimate of the average electric field in a room. The  relationship between this average field strength and the room's average reflection  coefficient provided an approximate gauge useful for rapid preliminary EMI risk  assessment within a room.</description><creator>Davis, Donald P.</creator><contributor>Trueman, C.

However, only a small portion of those who experience such  distress go on to develop these disorders, suggesting that individual and  stress-related variables may increase the vulnerability to the damaging effects of  chronic stress. Accordingly, the present series of experiments assess the influence  of three factors on vulnerability to long-term exposure to chronic variable stress  (CVS) in rats. In particular, we investigated the influence of gender, chronic  fluoxetine treatment and early life maternal care on the behavioral and  neuroendocrine response to CVS. The results from study 1 suggested that the  direction of the behavioral and neuroendocrine response to CVS was in the opposite  direction in male and female rats. Studies 2 and 3 revealed that fluoxetine  treatment had a gender-dependent ability to reverse some of the effects of CVS, and  this was mediated by increasing the rate of habituation to novel, acute stressors.  Studies 4 and 5 demonstrated a gender-dependent effect of maternal care on behavior  and the neuroendocrine response to an acute stress. In addition, maternal care  influenced the impact of CVS exposure in a gender-dependent manner. The results  suggested that maternal care affected coping processes in males and females that  were expressed in different behavioral tests. Studies 5, 6 and 7 revealed that  maternal care influenced the strength of associative fear conditioning to a context  associated with shock administration, but did not influence conditioning to a  discrete conditioned stimulus associated with shock. These results suggest that  maternal care influences the strength of learned associations on a  hippocampal-dependent task. Exposure to CVS eliminated the effect of maternal care  on the strength of contextual fear conditioning. Thus, conditions in the  post-weaning environment, such as CVS exposure, may reverse the effects of maternal</description><creator>Spreekmeester, Emma S.</creator><contributor>Rochford, Joseph (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Psychology, Physiological.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Mental Health.</subject><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Chronic variable stress : effects of gender, chronic fluoxetine treatment and early life maternal care</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xk81jk90h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/fx719m89v</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:dn39x192v</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:23:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis studies the impacts of credit risk, or the risk of  default, on the pricing of fixed income securities. It consists of three essays. The  first essay extends the classical corporate debt pricing model in Merton (1974) to  incorporate stochastic volatility (SV) in the underlying firm asset value and derive  a closed-form solution for the price of corporate bond. Simulation results show that  the SV specification for firm asset value greatly increases the resulting credit  spread levels. Therefore, the SV model addresses one major deficiency of the  Merton-type models: namely, at short maturities the Merton model is unable to  generate credit spreads high enough to be compatible with those observed in the  market. In the second essay, we develop a two-factor affine model for the credit  spreads on corporate bonds. The first factor can be interpreted as the level of the  spread, and the second factor is the volatility of the spread. Our empirical results  show that the model is successful at fitting actual corporate bond credit spreads.  In addition, key properties of actual credit spreads are better captured by the  model. Finally, the third essay proposes a model of interest rate swap spreads. The  model accommodates both the default risk inherent in swap contracts and the  liquidity difference between the swap and Treasury markets. The default risk and  liquidity components of swap spreads are found to behave very differently: first,  the default risk component is positively related to the riskless interest rate,  whereas the liquidity component is negatively correlated with the riskless interest  rate; second, although default risk accounts for the largest share of the levels of  swap spreads, the liquidity component is much more volatile; and finally, while the  default risk component has been historically positive, the liquidity component was  negative for much of the 1990s and has become positive since the financial market  turmoil in 1998.</description><creator>Li, Xiaofei, 1972-</creator><contributor>Jacobs, Kris (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2004</date><subject>Risk management.</subject><subject>Credit -- Mathematical models</subject><subject>Securities -- Valuation -- Mathematical models</subject><title>Three essays on the pricing of fixed income securities with credit risk</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rr171x73m.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dn39x192v</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Management</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9w0323552</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:23:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Stress activates dopamine (DA) transmission in the basolateral  amygdala (BLA), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc), and DA  transmission in these regions mediates different aspects of the behavioural response  to stress. Evidence indicates that a functional interdependence exists between the  DA projections to these areas. mPFC DA exerts an inhibitory influence on  stress-induced NAc DA release. Similarly, BLA DA modulates mPFC and NAc DA function,  although it is unknown if this is also the case in response to stress. Thus, we  examined whether BLA DA modulates NAc and mPFC DA release in response to stress. We  first determined the effects of BLA DA depletion on stress-induced NAc and mPFC DA  release. BLA DA depletion potentiated the NAc and attenuated the mPFC DA responses  to stress. We then examined the effects of intra-BLA D1 and D2/D3 receptor  antagonists on the NAc and mPFC DA responses to stress. BLA D1, but not D2/D3,  receptor antagonism potentiated and attenuated stress-induced NAc and mPFC DA  release, respectively. Co-administration of D1 antagonist into BLA and DA agonists  into mPFC abolished the potentiation of stress-induced NAc DA release, indicating  that BLA D1 receptor modulation of the NAc DA stress response occurs indirectly by  modulating stress-induced mPFC DA release. We then turned to examining the influence  of BLA DA on behavioural measures of information processing which are themselves  modulated by NAc and mPFC DA function. The effects of BLA D1 and D2/D3 receptor  blockade on prepulse inhibition (PPI) and latent inhibition (LI) were examined. BLA  D1 receptor antagonist enhanced and D2/D3 receptor antagonist reduced PPI.  Conversely, neither BLA DA receptor antagonist had an effect on LI. Finally, we  determined the effects of BLA D1 and D2/D3 receptor antagonists on acoustic startle  habituation. Although BLA DA receptor antagonism had no effect on this measure, both  D1 and D2/D3 receptor blockade reduc</description><creator>Stevenson, Carl W.</creator><contributor>Gratton, Alain (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2004</date><subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</subject><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Basolateral amygdala dopamine modulation of medial prefrontal cortical and nucleus accumbens dopamine function</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jd472w93g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9w0323552</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:x059c801h</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:23:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study explores and reiterates the significance carried by  the notions of place, multiplicity and experience in the approaches to the study of  architecture, in the shaping of cultures, and in the construction of urban  (hi)stories and topographies. The research aims to reveal the existence of a  transcultural space constituting the cosmos of Nicosia, capital city of the late  medieval and renaissance Kingdom of Cyprus. It is argued that the natural and built  environment of the city simultaneously witnessed as well as constructed this highly  obscure space, whose elusive nature has not been sufficiently or comprehensively  researched thus far. The purpose of this study is to unearth numerous attempts at  reconciliation by medieval civilizations, and to comprehend their repeated efforts  at bringing in parallel existence and understanding adjacent, but seemingly  oppositional or even confrontational, cultures and spaces. The method used engages a re-interpretation of Nicosia's urban  space by means of a scholarly narrative, defined as a comprehensively annotated  telling of citizens' experiences through the city. While maintaining that it is this  telling which better exposes the city's character, past findings on the  architecture, topography, and urban experience of Nicosia are concurrently examined,  some of them accepted and others re-proposed. Different architectural and ethical  realities for the city, as well as varied urban and social identities, emerge as  possibilities for pondering only after the superimposition of scientific findings on  an interweaving web of experiences, on the remarkably phenomenal world of medieval  urban space.</description><creator>Leventis, Panayiotis</creator><contributor>Castro, Ricardo.

These interactions cause  dislocation pinning, leading to strain aging. At lower temperatures  (&lt;400°C), the relevant solutes are interstitial (in particular,  carbon and nitrogen). At higher temperatures (&gt;800°C), substitutional  impurities are expected to be most influential. The same mechanisms that result in  the yield drops, increased flow stresses and increased work hardening associated  with strain aging at low temperatures should result in significant modification of  recovery and recrystallization behaviour at higher temperatures. The present work involves the deformation of austenitic (304)  stainless steel at high temperatures (800°C to 1280°C) in 1-hit and  2-hit high-temperature compression and multi-hit hot torsion testing. Experimental  variables include the strain rate, temperature and interpass time. Significant anomalies in the static softening kinetics are  observed; under certain deformation conditions, the normal relationship between  temperature and fractional softening is reversed. This effect is attributed to the  non-equilibrium segregation of phosphorus during the interpass holding time.  Analysis of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) in the material has revealed retardation  of the initiation of recrystallization; this effect is explained in terms of the  segregation of substitutional elements to the boundaries of new DRX  grains.</description><creator>Stewart, Gregg Ryan</creator><contributor>Jonas, John J.

The criminal justice system, driven by  private prosecutors, limited the ability of some victims to seek the law's  protection, but it allowed others to exercise considerable discretion and influence  over the pursuit of justice. The legal response to the crimes of infanticide, child  abuse, domestic violence, and spousal murder was equally contradictory. Infanticide  may have been depicted as a horrific crime, but the call for justice was never  strong. Society became increasingly sensitive to the notion that parents should be  held accountable for causing injury to children, but a belief in the sanctity of the  family was still paramount. When child abuse cases did come before courts, children  were often accorded the same legal remedies by courts as were adult victims.  Similarly, while the issue of family violence was not then a widespread societal  concern, and while the notion that a wife was subordinate to her husband remained a  prominent part of early-Victorian life, hundreds of abused wives prosecuted their  husbands for assault. Those cases reflect not only that abused wives were contesting  their partner's use of violence, but also that courts were willing to intervene.  Spousal murder cases were further evidence of contradiction: women were subject to  heightened legal penalties for killing their partners, but their gender also  insulated them from the full severity of the law. In a period before the sweeping public movements that developed  in the last several decades of the nineteenth century, courts were forced to grapple  with family violence because private prosecutors brought those issues before them.  In their willingness to hear cases involving infanticide, child abuse, domestic  violence, and spousal murder, courts made public some of Victorian Montreal's  darkest secrets. While the privately-driven system of justice was slowly to erode  over the intervening decades, that erosion was to coincide with the rise of public  crusades against child-cruelty, domestic violence, and other social issues. The  visibility of family violence likely fueled, and in turn was fueled by, those social  movements.</description><creator>Pilarczyk, Ian C.</creator><contributor>Baker, Blaine (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Family violence -- Law and legislation -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal.</subject><subject>Family violence -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal -- History -- 19th century.</subject><title>'Justice in the premises' : family violence and the law in Montreal, 1825-1850</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t148fh649.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1r66j147v</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Civil Law</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2b88qc67z</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:23:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Superantigens trigger the polyclonal activation of human T  cells. We exploited this property to gain insight into the mechanisms governing CD4  T cell expansion and to study the functional heterogeneity of naive and memory CD4 T  cell subsets. We show that the amount of TCR ligand affects the evolution of a T  cell response in two ways: by shaping the diversity of the T cell population  recruited in the proliferative pool and by affecting the progression of these  precursors into cell cycle. These two processes characterize a hierarchy of  recruitment of cells that strongly correlates with the efficiency of TCR engagement  but not with the relative precursor frequency in the non-immune repertoire.  Remarkably, once established, the distribution of T cell clones within a selected  repertoire is maintained by the characteristic of T cells to expand at a rate that  is independent of quantitative differences in ligand exposure. Moreover, at optimal  ligand concentrations that lead to the simultaneous expansion of all responsive T  cell clones, we observed a marked clone-specific heterogeneity in the capacity to  secrete cytokines. The functional heterogeneity of different CD4+ T cell  subpopulations was also studied using a superantigen model. Based on the expression  of CD45RA and CCR7, four distinct subsets of CD4+ T lymphocytes can be identified:  naive (CD45RA+ CCR7+), central memory (TCM, CD45RA- CCR7+), effector memory (TEM,  CD45RA- CCR7-) and a previously uncharacterized subset (CD45RA+ CCR7-).

In some, such as software engineering and cartography, graphs are required  to be visualized or drawn in ways that are easy to read and understand. In others,  such as VLSI design, graphs are required to be laid out while satisfying some  physical constraint. For example, when a drawing is to be displayed on a page or a  computer screen, or is to be used for VLSI design, it is important to keep its  area/volume small to avoid wasting space. More often than not however, the idea of a good drawing,  regardless of its purpose, coincides with having no edge crossings or having very  few crossings. Unfortunately, whichever of the numerous drawing styles one  considers, a problem requiring a crossing minimization of sorts will, almost  certainly, be NP -hard. The theory of fixed parameter tractability (FPT) provides a  new and promising approach for coping with intractable problems. In the first part  of this thesis we apply algorithmic techniques developed in this theory to  well-known graph drawing problems. In particular, we contribute efficient FPT  algorithms for crossing minimization and planarization problems concerning the  2-layer drawing style. In the second part of this thesis we introduce and  comprehensively study so-called track layouts of graphs and their subdivisions. A  relationship between this combinatorial structure and several well-known types of  graph layouts is established, leading to a number of new results. For example, our  study of track layouts of bounded treewidth graphs settles an open problem due to  Ganley and Heath (2001) regarding queue layouts of such graphs. Moreover, the study  also establishes that graphs of bounded treewidth have three-dimensional  straight-line grid drawings with linear volume. Through the study of track layouts of subdivisions, we determine  that every graph with n vertices and m edges has a three-dimensional polyline grid  drawing with the vertices on a rectangular prism, O (n + m log n) volume and O (log  n) bends per edge.</description><creator>Dujmović, Vida</creator><contributor>Whitesides, Sue (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2003</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Track layouts of graphs</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/br86b402m.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cn69m466k</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gq67jr73b</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:23:24Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The aim of this doctoral dissertation was to examine effects of  olfactory imagery on other sensory and perceptual processes, and to explore brain  areas involved in generation of olfactory mental images. Four studies, three  behavioral and one functional neuroimaging (Positron Emission Tomography, or PET),  were conducted, and healthy volunteers participated in all four studies. In Study 1,  participants were better at detecting weak odors when they simultaneously imagined  the same compared with a different odor as the one being detected. This effect of  olfactory imagery was specific, as the request to imagine objects visually did not  have any effect on detection of weak odors. In Studies 2 and 3, effects of presented  and imagined odors on taste perception were compared. Effects of imagined odors were  equivalent to the effects of presented odors when an objective measure of taste  perception (detection of a weak tastant, Study 3) was used, and comparable but more  limited when a subjective measure of taste perception (intensity ratings, Study 2)  was used. In Study 4, PET technology was used to investigate changes in cerebral  blood flow (CBF) associated with odor imagery. Participants were screened and  selected for their odor imagery ability, using the behavioral paradigm developed in  Study 1. Increased CBF associated with odor imagery was revealed in several areas  relevant for olfaction: the left primary olfactory cortical region including  piriform cortex, the left secondary olfactory cortical region (posterior  orbitofrontal cortex), and the rostral insula bilaterally. Interestingly, increased  activity in the primary olfactory cortex and the rostral insula was observed both in  the odor imagery and the odor perception subtraction. Based on the obtained  findings, I concluded that the effects of imagined odors on sensory processes are  specific when compared with visual imagery, and similar to the effects of presented  odors.

In order  to cope with these changing demographics, it is imperative that we better understand  aging and age-related pathologies. The reproductive tract provides an excellent  system in which to study aging in that it is affected by aging, without compromising  the overall health of the individual. In the Brown Norway rat model, the male  reproductive tract (testis and epididymis) shows numerous signs of aging when other  systems remain relatively unaffected by age, thus making this system ideal for  studies on underlying causes of aging. One of the many theories proposed to account  for the aging process is oxidative stress. Moreover, some of the changes that take  place in the aging epididymis are suggestive of oxidative stress. In order to  understand the contribution of oxidative stress to aging of the epididymis, we  undertook global gene expression studies of the tissue in the young animal and then  assessed how this gene expression was affected by age. We manipulated oxidative  stress by caloric restriction and antioxidant (vitamin E) supplementation and  deficiency. In characterizing the longitudinal gene expression in the young  epididymis, we identified many genes never before reported in this tissue. We found  that age profoundly affects gene expression in the epididymis and that the  expression of oxidative stress related transcripts decreased, most dramatically in  the distal (corpus and cauda epididymidis) regions of the tissue. Caloric  restriction attenuated or reversed many of the gene expression changes that took  place with age. The effect of caloric restriction was greatest for transcripts  associated with protein synthesis and mitochondrial function. Finally, we found that  long term antioxidant (vitamin E) deficiency resulted in increased expression of  oxidative stress transcripts and exacerbated the effect</description><creator>Jervis, Kathryn</creator><contributor>Robaire, Bernard (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2004</date><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Oxidative stress and aging of the male reproductive tract</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/g445cd67m.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7w62f871s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6w924c21x</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:23:25Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The rapid growth of Canadian pork industry has been challenged  by its negative impact on the environment. To find an economical and promising  solution to the environmental problems, 4% zeolite (90%+ clinoptilolite) were  supplemented to a regular (100% crude protein (CP) and energy) or low CP and energy  (90% CP and 90% energy or 90% CP and 85% energy) grower pig diets. Twenty male and  twenty-four female grower pigs were used in two feeding experiments respectively,  followed by a metabolic test with three batches of animals repeated to determine the  metabolic effects of zeolite supplementation. Pig performance (body weight gain,  daily feed intake and feed conversion ratio), and metabolic parameters (manure mass,  feed intake, protein and energy conversion, as well as dry feed and organic matter  retention) were evaluated. Zeolite supplementation at 4% to a regular diet for  grower pigs had a positive but not significant (P &gt; 0.05) effect on all pig  performance and metabolic parameters, compared to the regular diet without zeolite.  Among 4 rations, pigs on a regular diet with 4% zeolite performed consistently best  throughout the entire trail, with decreased average daily consumption and reduced  amount of feces, increased feed and organic matter retention in the gastrointestinal  tract, improved feed as well as protein and energy conversion, and enhanced body  weight gain. Moreover, zeolite supplementation at 4%, with 90% CP and 90% energy in  grower pig diets, improved feed and protein and energy conversion rate, and  increased body weight gain, when compared to those of pigs fed a regular diet  without zeolite. However, a diet of 90% of CP and 85% of energy with 4% zeolite  significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increased feed consumption and the amount of feces  produced, and decreased feed and organic matter retention in the gastrointestinal  tract, thus reducing feed conversion rate.

The purpose of this study was too determine whether  there were significant kinematic differences between recreational and elite hockey  players and between contra-lateral lower limbs during forward hockey  skating. Methods. While skating on a hockey treadmill subjects were  filmed with four synchronized digital video cameras while wearing reflective marker  triads on the thighs, shanks and skates. Subjects skated within a calibrated volume  at a self selected speed that they could maintain comfortably for one minute. Each  subject completed three trials separated by 5 minutes of rest. Data was reduced and  analyzed using programs written in MATLAB. Two-way ANOVA and Tukey Post Hoc tests  were used to determine statistic significance. Results. Elite and recreational subjects were significantly  different (p≤0.05) during knee abduction and knee rotation at push off, as  well as during knee abduction and knee flexion at blade contact. Contra lateral  lower limbs were significantly different (p≤0.05) during ankle abduction and  hip rotation at blade contact as well as during knee abduction at push  off. Conclusion. Some aspects of the skating stride are similar in  elite and recreational hockey skaters but there were several kinematic differences  between skill levels and contra-lateral legs. The skating kinematics of elite hockey  players may serve as a model for young hockey players and recreational hockey  players, helping them develop a more efficient and effective stride.</description><creator>Upjohn, Tegan</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Skating -- Physiological aspects</subject><subject>Kinematics</subject><subject>Hockey -- Physiological aspects</subject><title>Three-dimensional kinematics of the lower limbs during forward hockey skating</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hh63sw34r.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/37720d291</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:zg64tm484</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:23:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Papaya mosaic virus (PapMV), as a member of potexvirus family,  has a rod-shape, crystalline and repetitive structure. Other potexviruses have been  shown to possess proinflammatory properties. To test the proinflammatory properties  of PapMV, we first monitored chemokine transcripts expressed in murine macrophage  B10R cells. Our data revealed that PapMV rapidly induced two chemokines,  macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP)-2/CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL) 2 and  interferon-garmma inducible 10 kDa protein (IP-10)/CXCL 10 in a time and  dose-dependent manner. Thereafter, by using various macrophage deficient cell lines  (TLR4-/-,MyD88 -/-), we identified that PapMV-induced chemokines expression through  a TLR4 and MyD88-dependent signaling pathway. In addition, we obtained data  demonstrating that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway,  NF-kappaB, AP-1 were involved in this signaling. These factors play a pivotal role  in regulating PapMV-induced chemokine expression. Collectively, this study represents the first demonstration that  a plant virus can be recognized by mammalian cells and trigger an inflammatory  signal via TLR4/MyD88 pathway. Its proinflarnmatory capacity suggests that this  viral core protein represents an excellent candidate for the development of plant  virus-based vaccines.</description><creator>Wang, Tong Yu, 1968-</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><title>Proinflammatory properties of papaya mosaic virus (PapMV) are dependent on Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) engagement</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9g54xj17g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zg64tm484</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9z903044r</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:23:26Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study documents dynamic changes in the mean abundance and  body size of arthropods in an ephemeral pond over the course of a summer in order to  understand the nature of interactions that shape this community, and to assess the  risks posed by exposure to cercariae of the entomopathogenic digenean, Plagiorchis  elegans, a potential control agent for larval mosquitoes.

Alkanoic acids of sufficient chain length (CH3(CH3)nCO2H,  n &gt; 15) were found to form conformationally ordered monolayers on ZrO2 powder via  a chelating bidentate zirconium carboxylate surface bond. Variable temperature and  2D solid-state NMR experiments demonstrate that alkanoate monolayers display chain  dynamics similar to other self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). o-Hydroxy-alkanoic acids  (HO(CH3)15CO 2H) produce hydrophilic monolayers, with no evidence of the hydroxyl  group looping to the metal oxide substrate. Unlike the hydrocarbon analogues, perfluoroalkanoic acids  chemisorbed on both ZrO2 and TiO2 powders via a carboxylate bond forming stable and  thermally robust SAMs. Spin-lattice relaxation measurements showed that the adsorbed  SAMs are more mobile than in the bulk state. The motions associated with this  enhanced mobility are proposed to involve reorientations about the chain axis. No  evidence was found for chain melting in the fluorocarbon SAMs at temperatures well  above the melting point of the bulk acids. Since both long chain carboxylic and phosphonic acids form SAMs,  a series of diacids, (HO2C(CH2)nPO3H 2, n = 2, 3, 11, and 15), were deposited on  TiO2 and ZrO 2 powders and ZrO2 nanopowder to examine the structures formed by  bifunctional surfactants where both groups strongly interact with the substrate.  Solid-state 31P NMR data in combination with IR showed that the phosphonic acid  group binds selectively to the surface, producing a monolayer of carboxylic acid  terminated chains. The average chain conformation depends on the substrate and chain  length. Ordered samples display thermal order/disorder transitions similar to other  hydrocarbon SAM systems demonstrating that phosphonic acids are useful for  selectively introducing pendant polar functional groups on metal oxide surfaces. The  chain mobility relative to analogous methyl terminated chains is more restricted and  is attributed to hydrogen bonding among the pendant carboxylic acid groups. 1H fast  MAS NMR experiments revealed the nature of the surface hydrogen bonding in these  systems. Whereas dipolar coupled P-OH protons were observed on TiO2, only isolated  residual P-OH groups were detected on ZrO2, reflective of the stronger interaction  of phosphonic acids with the latter substrate. Two dimensional 1H double-quantum  fast MAS experiments revealed that only hydrogen bonded homodimers occur in the bulk  diacids while hydrogen bonding between the carboxylic and phosphonic acid groups  exists in multilayers of the diacids on the ZrO2 nanopowder.</description><creator>Pawsey, Shane</creator><contributor>Reven, Linda G.

Aggregation is monitored by suspension  analysis (turbidity) and optical microscopy and, in particular, a  conductivity-settling technique. To probe the mechanisms, electrophoretic mobility  (zeta potential) measurements and field emission scanning electron microscopy  (FE-SEM) imaging are used. In the case of sphalerite alone, for samples from a variety of  sources, aggregation occurred at pH 8--10, well above the range in iso-electric  point (pH 2--6). The aggregation is attributed to the presence of Zn(OH) 2, the  dominant species over this pH range. To test whether zinc hydrolysis products  promote aggregation silica and chalcopyrite suspensions were doped with Zn2+ ions;  aggregation over the same pH range was found. This observation is similar to that of  Healy and Jellet (1967) for zinc oxide, ZnO. They suggested aggregation was due to  release of Zn2+ ions to form Zn(OH)2 which polymerizes and flocculates the  particles. The same mechanism is proposed for sphalerite. Aggregation due to magnesium ions was determined using the  settling rate of sphalerite and silica suspensions (individually) as a function of  Mg 2+ concentration, pH and suspension density (%v/v solids). Aggregation at pH &gt;  10 was found for both minerals corresponding to magnesium hydroxide. However, the  mineral's response to the three variables suggests the mechanism for each is  different. The proposed mechanism of aggregation by Mg(OH) 2 for sphalerite is  chemical bridging and for silica, electrostatic bridging. Electrostatic bridging is  revealed by aggregation passing through a maximum as a function of both coagulant  concentration and pH. For sphalerite, while there is a maximum with [Mg2+] (Mg2+  concentration) there is none with pH (after allowing for the self-aggregation of  sphalerite). Further, electrostatic bridging requires surface patches of the  bridging material (Mg(OH)2) and the FE-SEM images showed no such evidence. The  interpretation for silica aggregating with Mg2+ follows that proposed by Krishnan  and Iwasaki (1986). The pH, [Mg2+] and solid concentration effects are compatible  with electrostatic bridging, as is the morphology as hydroxide patches were  identified by FE-SEM. In certain cases the conductivity-settling data suggested the  particles were more conductive than the liquid. The conductivity-settling technique  was adapted to measure the electrical conductivity of particles dispersed in water.  The conductivity was estimated at the iso-conductivity point where the solution and  the particles have the same conductivity. The technique was tested on chalcocite,  chalcopyrite, galena, pyrite and sphalerite. The order of mineral conductivity  followed that of their electrochemical rest potential, as expected. It is observed  that the adsorption of xanthate significantly reduced the conductivity of  chalcopyrite and copper activation increased the conductivity of sphalerite but  treatment with lead had no effect.</description><creator>Mirnezami, Mitra</creator><date>2002</date><subject>Engineering, Metallurgy.</subject><title>Aggregation studies on sphalerite systems</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/v692t6898.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vt150j74d</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining, Metals and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:h989r3688</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:23:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Kinematically redundant manipulators composed of a rigid-link,  rigid-joint robot and a structurally flexible arm on top of which the former is  located constitute a new paradigm of long-reach manipulation systems. In order to  have the end-effector of such a system faithfully follow a preplanned path, one  should be able to reliably monitor the motions of the flexible submanipulator due to  its elastic deformations. To this end, it is proposed that redundant  point-acceleration measurements made on the rigid-robot base be used in an extended  Kalman filter to estimate the flexural states of the flexible submanipulator. More  specifically, this is done by processing the above-mentioned acceleration data in a  novel pose and twist estimation technique, formulated in this thesis, to obtain  those of the tip of the flexible arm; the pose and the twist data are then utilized  as the measured outputs for the observer. Of course, the state-output relations  should be linearized; the linearization is performed in closed-form. The mathematical models of the flexible and the rigid  submanipulators are derived separately, each through the premultiplication of the  transpose of the kinematic-constraint matrix by the assembled set of the link  Lagrange equations; this matrix is the natural orthogonal complement of the  kinematic-constraint wrench. Obviously, the reaction wrench acting between the  rigid-robot base and the end-effector of the flexible submanipulator couples the two  sets of dynamics equations. This wrench can be determined by substituting the  twist-rate of the base, i.e., its angular and translational accelerations, into the  dynamics equations of the rigid submanipulator and, subsequently, solving them.  Then, considering the wrench as a time-dependent input for the flexible arm, we take  the flexible-arm dynamics as the modelled dynamics in the observer. The  reduced-order dynamics helps dramatically reduce the required floating-point  operations within the observer. Two redundancy-resolution techniques, namely, rigid-link  redundancy resolution and flexible-link redundancy resolution, are discussed.  Whereas the former assumes all the links to be rigid, the latter takes the  flexibility effects into account. In both approaches, the self-motion of the system  is computed so as to minimize the forces exciting its lowest "modal  coordinates" while imposing a proportional damping on the flexural  dynamics.</description><creator>Parsa, Kourosh</creator><contributor>Angeles, Jorge (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Misra, Arun K.

Nevertheless, it is possible to detect a sizeable amount of  intertextual references in several Quebecer books written by authors of that  generation. In Quebec, these young writer's influences are as distinct as they are  diverse, varying from Kerouac to Hemingway and from Sartre to Camus. But concerning  their Quebecer role model, one name continually returns, that of Rejean  Ducharme. The goal of this thesis is to illustrate the presence of  ducharmesque universe in three Generation X novels, namely Le souffle de l'harmattan  by Sylvain Trudel, Vamp by Christian Mistral and La rage by Louis Hamelin. Within  these novels, we will attempt to find the trail of three typical elements to  Ducharme's work: the rejection of conformity, the contempt towards a consumer  society, and the substitution of a utopian universe for reality. According to Francois Ricard, Ducharme belongs to what he calls  the "generation lyrique", which is the eldest baby boomers, while  Generation X is composed of Baby Boom's youngest members. Interestingly enough, one  should expect such a generational conflict between these two cohorts to incite  Generation X writers to despite their predecessor. Hence, this thesis will conclude  with a few tentative explanations as to why Generation X authors were so driven to  choose Rejean Ducharme, a member of the "generation lyrique", to be their  role model.</description><creator>Ménard, Valérie</creator><date>2004</date><subject>French-Canadian literature -- Québec (Province) -- History and criticism</subject><subject>French-Canadian literature -- 20th century -- History and criticism</subject><subject>Ducharme, Réjean -- Influence</subject><subject>French-Canadian literature -- 21st century -- History and criticism</subject><title>L'influence de Réjean Ducharme chez les écrivains de la génération x</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n870zr23m.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zw12z5859</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5138jf28s</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:23:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study concerns the multicultural influences which shaped  the architectural form and artistic decoration of the Synagogue at Dura-Europos, an  ancient city located on the west bank of the upper Euphrates in Syria (244/5 C. E.)  Preserving the Jewish tradition after the destruction of the Second Temple, in a  location remote from Palestine, was essential in order to maintain a strong identity  in the small Jewish community of Dura, engulfed by pagan and multitheistic  societies. Biblical narratives were used by the Jewish community to assert their  history. In chapter 1, there appears a discussion of what scholars have said about  the cultural development of Dura, how the Synagogue paintings reflect it, and how  these represent a Jewish identity. In chapter 2, two scenes from the frescoes will  be discussed, highlighting the various cultural influences, both foreign and local.  On the other hand Rabbinic literature, including the Midrash, the Mishnah and the  Mekhilta de R. Ishmael, compiled by the third century C. E., gives a textual  explanation for the scenes, emphasizing the strong association that the Jews of Dura  had with their roots and heritage.</description><creator>Steinlauf, Eva</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Dura-Europos (Extinct city) -- Religion</subject><subject>Mural painting and decoration -- Syria -- Dura-Europos (Extinct city)</subject><subject>Jewish art and symbolism -- Syria -- Dura-Europos (Extinct city).</subject><subject>Synagogue of Dura-Europos (Dura-Europos)</subject><subject>Synagogue art -- Syria -- Dura-Europos (Extinct city).</subject><title>The frescoes of the Dura-Europos Synagogue : multicultural traits and Jewish identity</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5712m7113.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5138jf28s</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Jewish Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mg74qm54h</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:23:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis proposes an anti-Orientalist reading of the portrait  of the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror (r. 1451-1481) by Gentile Bellini. The  artist's work is analysed in the context of the Venetian Renaissance and the status  of the visual arts in the Ottoman Empire. Mehmed's patronage of Italian artists, who  created medallic and pictorial portraits of the sovereign, is considered together  with the local translation of conventions enabled by early modern cross-cultural  encounters. The Western political and intellectual climate following the conquest of  Constantinople by Mehmed in 1453 is examined and, in particular, the secularising  crusade literature produced by humanist scholars. Covert efforts to incorporate the  Turks within the boundaries of civilised society coexisted with the conventional  derogatory anti-Turkish propaganda. Bellini's portrait is seen as an attempt to  portray the sultan as a member of the Venetian aristocracy. The historiographical  record of modern academic scholarship in the disciplines of history and art history  exploring these cross-cultural exchanges is set in a framework that explores the  role of Edward Said's Orientalism in light of recent developments.</description><creator>Stamoulos, Eva</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Mehmed II, Sultan of the Turks, 1432-1481 -- Portraits</subject><subject>Orientalism.</subject><subject>Bellini, Gentile, d. 1507.

Discussions of sustainability often remain at a  local level without addressing global sustainability and yet the need for local  engagement is well demonstrated. Using the case of Montreal's West Island, two  environmental information tools were created and then evaluated on their ease of  development, ability to be publicly engaging and ability to link the local and  global scales. The first tool was a GIS visualization of sub-municipal ecological  footprints and the second was a more conventional GIS 'atlas'. Focus groups were  used to test the two tools. The atlas tool was considerably easier to create, and  both tools succeeded in engaging participants. Focus group analysis does suggest  however, that while local land-use based maps remain advantageous for exploring  specific local and structural issues, local ecological footprints are better able to  facilitate local-global linkages.</description><creator>Klinsky, Sonja</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Environmental education -- Geographic information systems -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</subject><subject>Geographic information systems -- Québec (Province) -- Montréal</subject><title>Making and using environmental information : an analysis of the development and use of two GIS tools for public environmental engagement</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4f16c341q.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qb98mg020</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5m60qs50m</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:23:30Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Population growth and internal migration in parts of the  developing world have led to increased conflict over land rights carried out in the  context of competing tenure paradigms. In Kenya, violent conflict between  'indigenous' and 'outsider' communities occurring in the midst of a program of  democratic liberalization and political change has been variously explained as  primarily driven by material or political interests. This thesis examines land  rights conflict in the wake of a violent clash at Enoosupukia in 1993, which led to  the displacement of up to 30,000 people, and analyzes how changing tenure paradigms,  shifting socio-spatial boundaries, ethno-political polarization, and pressure on  land resources all contribute to the perpetuation of conflict and tenure  uncertainty. I argue that, despite challenging civil precepts of liberal governance,  assertion of exclusive ethnic rights to traditional territories may nevertheless  lead to political justice and alleviate the marginalization of indigenous and  minority groups.</description><creator>Matter, Scott</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Land tenure -- Kenya</subject><subject>Kenya -- Ethnic relations -- Political aspects</subject><subject>Land reform -- Kenya.</subject><title>"We have this land as our right" : ethnicity, politics, and land rights conflict at Enoosupukia, Kenya</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/d217qq07h.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5m60qs50m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anthropology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):43525</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
