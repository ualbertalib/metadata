By way of contrast, some of his epistemological and ethical writings look as if Lewis had fulfilled the promise of linguistic analysis before it was made by Wittgenstein. Lewis' discussion of the good looks like an anticipation of the linguistic method. The question "what is good?" is answered as if it read "how is the word 'good' used?"

The procedure used by these workers, which  was based upon the growth response of individual soil isolates in six nutritional media, proved to be cumbersome in the laboratory, largely because of the necessity of using one hundred or more isolates from each soil sample to obtain statistically valid results.</description><creator>Jones, Graham.

It begina with an analysis of this framework, and a brief examination of the respective roles of the two major agricultural industries, sugar and cacao, within the agricultural sector. The history of the cocao industry is then traced from its beginnings to the present. Following this, the attempt is made to place the Trinidad industry in clear perspective with regard to the world cacao industry, with a view to gauging its present strength and future potential. Remaining chapters deal with the aima, achievements, and shortcomings of the measures for achieving this potential which are currently in use. The writer has chosen to use the spelling "cacao" as opposed to "cocoa" , according to the convention whereby the former denotes the tree and raw product, and the latter the manufactured article. The alternative spelling appears in places, however, when quoting sources which use it.[...]</description><creator>Jarrette, Neil. M.</creator><contributor>Haviland, W.

Stem rust (Puccinia graminis tritici Eriks. and Henn.) is one of these serious diseases and it often occurs in an epiphytotic form. It is a common observation that some wheat varieties are very susceptible to a particular rust race and are sometimes completely destroyed while other varieties prove to be resistant. The knowledge of these facts led plant pathologists to realise the importance of resistant varieties and to study the nature of resistance to this disease. </description><creator>Jain, Abir.

Due to its heterozygous inheritance pattern, each apple variety must be propagated or increased by vegetative means. Since most fruiting varieties of apple do not root readily from cuttings, it is customary to graft them upon the root of another apple tree grown for the purpose.

In the now classical case of ring-theory, a certain ideal - called the radical - plays a fundamental role in the development of this theorem. We propose to state in abstract terms what this role is, in order to facilitate a reasonable generalization of the radical concept for semirings. In order to be useful, any algebraic notion must, of course, possess a characterization which can be formulated in terms of elements in an algebraic structure; the radical satisfies this requirement.</description><creator>Hoechsmann, Klaus.</creator><contributor>Zassenhaus, H.

Such initiator systems were observed to be much more effective when a reducing agent was present with the oxidizing agent to form a system usually designated as a redox catalyst. Potassium peroxydisulphate, more familiarly known as potassium persulphate, is an example of such a compound and has received wide application as a polymerization initiator or catalyst (1, 2, 3).</description><creator>Henderson, John.

Aegeus, another mythical hero and son of Thesseus, the founder of Athens, made his expedition to Crete, to kill the Minotaur of the Labyrinth, on board a ship, the sails of which were black. Already at that time, mariners were performing Sea Commerce between the various then known parts of the world. The owner of the ship was, at the same time, Master and merchant; he bought things in one place and sold them in another.</description><creator>Hadjis, Dimitris.</creator><contributor>Pépin, E.

It has, however, been falling short of its potential productivity in this area. Within recent years, considerable research has been conducted with a view to evaluating the effects of various factors on the longevity and vigour of the red clover plant. The current view is that a complex of interacting factors, including varietal differences, weather conditions, and the attack of a large number of insect species, fungus diseases and possibly nematodes is involved in reducing the yield of this crop.</description><creator>Gustafson, Jean.

With few exceptions the boundaries enclosed populations of the same ethnic origins and similar cultural and linguistic backgrounds. When the parallel process was initiated in Central and Eastern Europe the boundaries tended to enclose within one state several heterogeneous groups, widely divergent ethnically and culturally. Such states were faced with the problem of the relationship between the dominant nationality and the national minorities.</description><creator>Glickman, Rose.</creator><contributor>Mladenovic, M.

The incidence of hookworm infection was found to be 95 per cent in 70 dogs examined. This parasite has been found in dogs from points; all across northern Canada and as far north as Ellesmere Island (Cameron et al. 1940). It has also been reported by Law (1933) from arctic fox taken in the region of Hudson Bay who also mentioned that Hadwen had found it in Alaskan dogs. This suggests that the parasite is particularly well adapted for life in a northern environment.</description><creator>Gibbs, Harold. C.</creator><contributor>Cameron, T.

The purpose of these tests was to investigate the compressibility under foundations. After outlining a section of the theory of elasticity, with certain modifications, attempts were made to correlate the experimental results with this theory and to compare them also with previous work carried out in this chapter of soil mechanics. In concluding, recommendations were given as a guide for future research.</description><creator>Genest, George. L.</creator><contributor>De Stein, J.

Wood bark is one or the major byproducts. In the paper industry alone millions of tons of bark are discarded annually and as a result have created an ever growing disposal problem. Investigation has already broadened knowledge as to the physical and chemical properties or this waste material and a beginning has been made in putting it to economic use. A series or investigations conducted in the Division or Industrial and Cellulose Chemistry has been concerned with discovering as much as possible about the chemical composition or bark.</description><creator>Gardner, Prescott.
