This loss of hot ductility in the temperature range 700--1100°C in carbon and low alloy steels is related to transverse surface cracks during the straightening operation of the continuous casting process of steel. An additional problem, found in peritectic steels, is its very coarse as cast structure, which is very prone to cracking during the straightening stage. In this regard, two major solutions have been suggested to date to improve hot ductility, adjusting the straightening stage to be below or above the low hot ductility region and chemical composition modification. However, both the solutions have limitations and the problem of cracking during continuous casting is still persistent. In this study, a peritectic steel was melted in-situ and the hot ductility trough was quantified at temperatures ranging from 700 to 1100°C. It was also subjected to very high temperature deformation in the single phase austenite region (1400--1300°C) during cooling from the solidus temperature. It was noticed that such deformation can improve the hot ductility, which could alleviate cracking problem during continuous casting. Microstructural studies showed that such improvement can be attributed to grain refinement owing to dynamic recrystallization during the deformation applied after solidification. Fracture analysis revealed that the deformation altered the grain boundary segregation as well. The Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) measurements showed that the very high temperature deformation lowered the concentration of detrimental elements, such as S, N, Mn and C, at grain boundaries. This also contributed to the HD improvements. The steel specimens were also reheated to temperatures below the solidus and subjected to the very high temperature deformation prior to HD testing. As was expected, the reheated specimens showed better HD than the melted ones. Microstructural examination showed that the very high temperature deformation encouraged recrystallization and grain refinement. AES studies of the reheated specimens showed no change in concentration of detrimental elements.</description><creator>Rezaeian, Ahmad.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Continuous casting.</subject><subject>Vanadium steel -- Hot working.</subject><subject>Vanadium steel -- Ductility.</subject><subject>Microalloying.</subject><title>The effect of very high temperature deformation on the hot ductility of a V-microalloyed steel /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/r207ts71q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ws859k23c</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:st74cv31s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:59:35Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis investigates the behaviour of electricity markets under marginal and pay-as-bid pricing. Marginal pricing is believed to yield the maximum social welfare and is currently implemented by most electricity markets. However, in view of recent electricity market failures, pay-as-bid has been extensively discussed as a possible alternative to marginal pricing. In this research, marginal and pay-as-bid pricing have been analyzed in electricity markets with both perfect and imperfect competition. The perfect competition case is studied under both exact and uncertain system marginal cost prediction. The comparison of the two pricing methods is conducted through two steps: (i) identify the best offer strategy of the generating companies (gencos); (ii) analyze the market performance under these optimum genco strategies. The analysis results together with numerical simulations show that pay-as-bid and marginal pricing are equivalent in a perfect market with exact system marginal cost prediction. In perfect markets with uncertain demand prediction, the two pricing methods are also equivalent but in an expected value sense. If we compare from the perspective of second order statistics, all market performance measures exhibit much lower values under pay-as-bid than under marginal pricing. The risk of deviating from the mean is therefore much higher under marginal pricing than under pay-as-bid. In an imperfect competition market with exact demand prediction, the research shows that pay-as-bid pricing yields lower consumer payments and lower genco profits. This research provides quantitative evidence that challenges some common claims about pay-as-bid pricing. One is that under pay-as-bid, participants would soon learn how to offer so as to obtain the same or higher profits than what they would have obtained under marginal pricing. This research however shows that, under pay-as-bid, participants can at best earn the same profit or expected profit as under marginal pricing. A second common claim refuted by this research is that pay-as-bid does not provide correct price signals if there is a scarcity of generation resources. We show that pay-as-bid does provide a price signal with such characteristics and furthermore argue that the price signal under marginal pricing with gaming may not necessarily be correct since it would then not reflect a lack of generation capacity but a desire to increase profit.</description><creator>Ren, Yongjun, 1970-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Competition -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Electric utilities -- Rates -- Mathematical models.</subject><subject>Electric utilities -- Costs -- Mathematical models.</subject><title>A comparison of pay-as-bid and marginal pricing in electricity markets /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/37720h52f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/st74cv31s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:w95054028</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:59:36Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Most studies that examined the relationship between retinal structure and function did so on altricial animals; animals that are born with closed eyes and an immature retina. However, if one wishes to transpose results to humans, we must take into consideration the fact that the human infant is born with its eyes opened and mature retina (precocial). Also, while the human retina is composed of approximately 6% cones, the retinas of rats and mice (the most common models) are made of 1--3% cones. Hence, the guinea pig (Cavia Porcellus) offers an excellent alternative to the usual rodent models. It is born with its eyes open following 65 days of gestation. Guinea pigs are diurnal animals (unlike most rodents) and their retina is reported to include between 8--15% cones. Compared to the usual rodent models (rats and mice), newborn guinea pigs are thus closer to human infants. Consequently, the purpose of this thesis was to investigate the maturation and aging of the retinal structure and function of the Hartley albino guinea pig in order to determine if they represent a better animal model of human retinal structure and function. Following an accidental mating between a brother and a sister in our pedigree of albino guinea pigs, we discovered that one pup (out of four) was affected with a night blinding disorder as per ERG. Consequently, the second purpose of this thesis was also to examine the maturation and aging of the retinal structure and function of our night blind guinea pig colony in order to characterize this unique retinopathy. In summary, our studies demonstrated that albino guinea pigs do represent a better animal model of the human retinal structure and function compared to the more frequently used altricial animals. We demonstrated that even if the retina of albino guinea pigs is adult-looking at birth, it undergoes retinal maturation of its structure and function albeit not to the same extent as in altricial animals like rats and mice. Additionally, our new and naturally occurring animal model of night blindness could represent a valid model to study the mechanisms involved in generating a functional retinal disorder such as those encountered in humans and to study the cone in absence of rod.</description><creator>Racine, Julie.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Electroretinography.</subject><subject>Disease Models, Animal.</subject><subject>Night Blindness -- physiopathology.</subject><subject>Retina -- physiology.</subject><subject>Retinal Diseases -- physiopathology.</subject><subject>Guinea Pigs.</subject><title>Maturation and aging of the retina in normal and night blind albino guinea pigs : a structural and functional study</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/h989r677v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w95054028</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0k225f72f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:59:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A transmission-blocking strategy will prevent the spread of malaria and has the potential to reduce morbidity and death from this disease. Reducing parasite transmission would also prolong the useful life of antimalarial drugs or vaccines by preventing the spread of parasites that become resistant to these therapies. In this thesis, I evaluated molecular and pharmacological methods to block the transmission of the malaria parasite from the definitive host, the mosquito, to the intermediate host. Inhibitors of proteins that are involved in mosquito invasive stages could decrease the transmission potential of each mosquito. Disruption of the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase related protein (carp) gene in Plasmodium berghei, decreased the ability of ookinetes to invade the mosquito midgut, and those sporozoites that were produced were defective in their ability to traverse mosquito salivary glands. This indicates that a putative signaling pathway involving PbCARP regulates the level of infection in the mosquito by mediating invasion of mosquito tissues. A compound that targets both asexual and transmission stages would be an ideal antimalarial. I showed that treatment of malaria with the AT-binding drug, centanamycin inhibited blood-stage infections in mice and arrested parasite development within the midguts of mosquitoes, such that sporozite development was effectively blocked. The mechanism of parasite death is associated with modification of Plasmodium genomic DNA. Damage to parasite DNA during blood-stage infection persisted from the vertebrate to the mosquito host and provides a novel biochemical strategy to block malaria transmission. Radiation or genetic attenuation of sporozoites are two approaches for whole organism vaccines that are protective against malaria. Using centanamycin, I demonstrated that attenuated sporozoites could also induce protective immunity in mice. The chemical attenuation of sporozoites using centanamycin impaired parasite function both in vitro and in vivo. Inoculation of mice with sporozoites that were treated in vitro with centanamycin failed to produce a blood stage infection, and mice injected with a single immunizing dose were protected against subsequent challenge with wild type sporozoites. This demonstrates that chemical attenuation of sporozoites is a viable alternative for the production of an effective liver stage vaccine for malaria.</description><creator>Purcell, Lisa A.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Antimalarials -- therapeutic use.</subject><subject>Indoles -- therapeutic use.</subject><subject>Plasmodium.</subject><subject>Malaria vaccine.</subject><subject>Antimalarials.</subject><subject>Malaria Vaccines.</subject><subject>Plasmodium -- genetics.</subject><title>Genetic and biochemical strategies to block the transmission cycle of the malaria parasite</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5t34sn911.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0k225f72f</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Parasitology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:w0892f65t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:59:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Vaccination, biosecurity and selection for genetic resistance are used world-wide in the poultry industry against the threat of Marek's disease (MD). Unfortunately there are new outbreaks of MD that cause serious economic problems. Scientists are therefore searching for new and more effective ways to improve existing controls of the disease. Knowledge of the chicken genome and progress in the study of the molecular biology of the MD virus are providing new approaches to MD control. A particularly useful strategy is the identification of genes that affect viral and tumor susceptibility. Genetic markers in the growth hormone receptor (GHR), the growth hormone (GH) and the chemokine MIP-3alpha that are associated with MD resistance have previously been identified in our laboratory. In this thesis we identified additional candidate genes by analyzing genes of the vitamin D metabolism; conducted a large scale challenge experiment with Marek's disease virus and tested genes encoding enzymes involved in vitamin D metabolism for association with disease resistance. The first manuscript describes the analysis of three genes of the vitamin D metabolism for sequence variability and their association with the proportion of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) that display the surface antigens LYB, MHC II, CD3, CD4, CD8, TCR1 (Tgammadelta) and TCR2 (Talphabeta). We identified a genetic marker in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene that affected the frequency of the MHC class II expressing leukocytes (P=0.0007), and a marker in the vitamin D binding protein gene that (DBP S1P15) affected the expression of TCR1. The goal of the second study was to conduct selection in a commercial strain of White Leghorns for markers in the GH, GHR and MIP-3alpha genes that had previously been associated with MD resistance and to compare the resistance of the selected and non-selected commercial cross. We conducted two challenge experiments three months apart with 100 chickens from the selected and 100 chickens from a non-selected population in each challenge. To maintain similarity in poultry management, we followed a commercial vaccination procedure. A database was compiled that comprised measurements of the viral titers in extracts of feather tips on a weekly basis up to 8 weeks post infection, a record of mortality and a necropsy analysis of all chickens, including those that died during the experiment. The outcome in challenge 1 differed from challenge 2. In challenge 1 the selected population had a two-fold lower viral load than the non-selected control population (P=10-5) while in challenge 2 the situation was reversed (P=10-3). A comparison of the effect of the challenge on the two populations shows that the titers in the non-selected population in the two challenges were similar, while the titers in the selected population differed by a factor of four. Hence the challenges were reproducible for the non-selected population but not for the selected population. The same conclusion was reached when other indicators of MD, such as mortality, frequency of proliferative lesions, loss of body weight or atrophy of the bursa were measured. The source of the different behaviors is unknown, but it raises the possibility that immune compromising factors such as stress, nutritional status, maternal antibodies or infections may compromise the response to MD infection in a manner that is dependent on the genetic background. In the third manuscript we used the database we had created to analyze the influence of three markers in the chicken VDR gene on MD resistance. We found that the marker that had been found to be associated with MHC class II was also associated with a reduced viral titer (P=0.002). The effect of the genotypes was additive with a 50% difference between the two homozygotes. It was independent of the population as well as the challenge. Other indicators of MD behaved concordantly. The result is the first evidence that genetic variants in genes encoding enzymes involved in vitamin D metabolism may affect MD resistance in chickens.</description><creator>Prasličková, Dana.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Chickens -- Diseases -- Immunological aspects.</subject><subject>Vitamin D -- Metabolism.</subject><subject>Marek's disease -- Immunological aspects.</subject><subject>Natural immunity.</subject><title>Association of markers in the vitamin D receptor with MHC class II expression and Marek's disease resistance</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4m90dz85g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w0892f65t</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Animal Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:s4655m06m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:59:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Concrete deteriorates over time due to environmental changes and/or poor construction processes which can eventually lead to partial or total failure of a structure. Deterioration in concrete manifests itself in different forms such as: freeze and thaw, chemical attack, surface and internal flaws. Concrete and shotcrete linings are widely used as support systems in underground excavations. Surprisingly, a fragmented, damaged shotcrete support system can actually create a less stable environment than the unsupported rock mass. Detection of internal flaws remains a difficult task as they are not always observable on the surface. Yet, the potential to expand and cause damage to the structure is omnipresent. The focus of this work is to locate and characterize two main and common features in concrete structures, (1) sub-horizontal cracks; (2) rock-concrete interfaces. Traditionally, this has been difficult to detect by currently available NDT methods. To obtain high resolution images of cracks in concrete, an extension of the ultrasonic nondestructive technique known as Synthetic Aperture Focusing Technique (SAFT) has been used. However, in order to achieve our research objective, we developed a modified SAFT code in this work. The results of this study demonstrate that the resolving power of our modified 3D SAFT algorithm can provide an accurate profile of both a rock-concrete interface and/or cracks with angles varying from 5 to 15 degrees within concrete slabs having thicknesses of up to twenty centimetres.</description><creator>Hosseini, Zahra.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Concrete construction -- Deterioration.</subject><subject>Concrete -- Nondestructive testing.</subject><subject>Synthetic apertures.</subject><subject>Concrete construction -- Testing.</subject><title>Detection of sub-horizontal flaws in concrete using the synthetic aperture focusing technique</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ff3658638.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/s4655m06m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Materials Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sn00b227n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:59:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Supplementation of selenium (Se) has been shown to have important hypocholesterolemic properties in animal experiments and in some human trials; however, underlying mechanisms remain unclear. One possible mechanism may be via the liver X receptor (LXR) pathway that lowers intestinal cholesterol absorption and enhances cholesterol conversion into bile acids. The present thesis studied the effect of Se on LXR ligands (oxysterols) and mRNA abundance of LXR responsive genes, ATP-binding cassette proteins G5 and G8 (abcg5, abcg8), and Nieman-Pick C1-Like 1 protein (npc1/1) in hepatic and jejunal tissues in the Syrian hamster. The first study demonstrated that: (a) hepatic oxysterol concentrations are increased, and plasma cholesterol decreased in hamsters fed supplemental Se; (b) 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) concentrations are increased in HepG2 cells treated with Se at physiological concentrations in a dose response manner. The second study provided Syrian hamsters supplemental Se in a dose response manner to ascertain if Se: (a) increases hepatic oxysterols through upregulation of specific hepatic P450 enzyme activity and abundance; and (b) decreases plasma and hepatic lipids through LXR pathway upregulation of hepatic abcg5 and abcg8 and increased cholesterol secretion into bile. Se lowered plasma LDL-C concentrations and increased hepatic 27-OHC concentrations without effect on specific P450 enzymes, hepatic cholesterol concentrations or hmgcr . Se upregulated hepatic ldlr and abcg8 without affecting abcg5 or cholesterol and bile acid levels in gallbladder bile. The third study looked at the response of the jejunum to dose response Se supplementation in Syrian hamsters in terms of jejunal abcg5, abcg8, ldlr, hmgcr and npc1/1. Similar to liver, Se treatment was associated with increased abcg8 without showing an effect on abcg5. Jejunal npc1/1 was upregulated with Se treatment suggesting that Se might have diminished enterocyte cholesterol levels via its effect on increasing abcg8. As with gallbladder bile, Se did not increase fecal cholesterol concentrations or bile acids. In conclusion, although Se upregulates the hepatic concentrations of oxysterols and increases abundance of hepatic and jejunal abcg8, ldlr and jejunal npc1/1, the hypocholesterolemic effect of Se does not appear to involve the LXR pathway.</description><creator>Poirier, Johanne.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Cholesterol -- Metabolism.</subject><subject>Hypocholesteremia.</subject><subject>Golden hamster -- Nutrition.</subject><subject>Selenium -- Health aspects.</subject><title>An investigation into the mechanisms of the hypocholesterolemic effect of selenium in the Syrian hamster /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1g05fg412.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sn00b227n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9c67wr39w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:59:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>A class of infinite dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes that arise as solutions of stochastic partial differential equations with noises generated by measure-valued catalytic processes is investigated. The first topic is the determination of the covariance structure of the processes and identification of the Hilbert space in which the solutions live and have continuous paths. Example of catalysts which are singular measures or measure-valued processes are given and results on the behavior of the corresponding catalytic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes are obtained.

While voice communications still dominate, data services are expected to be prevalent in the future. Efficient use of the radio spectrum is essential to offer voice and data wireless mobile communications services at a competitive price. Third Generation cellular systems are based on code-division multiple access technology and suffer from multiple-access interference, which limits system capacity. Several approaches exist to mitigate this interference, including multiuser detection and beamforming. To reduce the complexity of the space-time multiuser detection, it has been proposed recently to exploit the spatial dimension offered by an antenna array at the receiver, by forming groups of users and apply detection individually to each group. In this work, new space-time receiver structures derived from the group-optimal minimum mean square error (MMSE) linear detector are proposed and studied for the uplink. In particular, the optimal group-based linear space-time multiuser detection block-receiver with and without beamforming is derived. The family of group-based multiuser detection structures introduces inter-group-interference (IGI), which is caused by the non-orthogonality between groups. To overcome this limitation, new multistage group-based receiver structures based on successive interference cancellation and parallel interference cancellation are derived and studied. In addition, it is proposed to take advantage of the full computational capabilities of practical receiver structures by introducing non-mutually exclusive grouping. Furthermore, the computational complexity of the proposed structures is studied in details. Finally, the computer simulation results demonstrate that the proposed reduced-complexity group-based approaches proposed provide a bit error rate performance close to that of the full linear MMSE multiuser detector, at a fraction of the computational cost.</description><creator>Pelletier, Benoît, 1977-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Code division multiple access.</subject><subject>Demodulation (Electronics)</subject><title>Group-based approaches to space-time multiuser detection in WCDMA</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ws859k24n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9s161987q</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3484zm344</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:59:41Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The current dissertation focusses on two studies testing the integration of the hopelessness theory of depression and buffer theory of social support. Two literature reviews are provided which outline the theories and research to date in both child and adult samples. Among the conclusions discussed in these reviews, it is argued that the integration of these theories is likely to provide a superior model for explaining depressive onset. In line with the integrative theory, it was proposed that low social support, depressogenic inferential styles, and negative events would interact to predict increases in depressive symptoms. Results from a 6 week study of 333 schoolchildren demonstrated that social support did not serve a buffering function, rather, both depressogenic inferential styles and low social support acted as separate vulnerability factors for the development of depressive symptoms following negative events. Results from a 6 week study of 131 undergraduate psychology students demonstrated that social support network size, achievement-related inferential style, and negative achievement events interacted to predict increases in depressive symptoms following negative events. At the same time, the majority of analyses in this study revealed a significant main effect on depressive symptoms for depressogenic inferential style. Taken together the results of these investigations suggest that social support may have differential effects in child versus adult populations. A number of interesting questions are also raised by the second study regarding the ability of the hopelessness theory to predict recovery from depression in adult samples. Future work is warranted to clarify the precise nature of protection offered by high social support for cognitively vulnerable individuals.</description><creator>Payne, Andrew V.

Empirical evidence on the consequences of reduced dietary diversity and exposure to functional dietary elements is sorely lacking in the literature. To address this, a food frequency and ethnomedical survey of 365 participants stratified according to age, gender and area of residence was conducted in coastal Papua New Guinea (PNG), and anthropometry, blood pressure and fasting blood glucose (FBG) recorded. Our results support the hypothesis that reduced food variety, especially in the fruits and vegetables group, is associated with increased obesity, hypertension and FBG, particularly in urban people. Application of the quantitative index for dietary diversity (QUANTIDD) showed that this was a superior indicator of nutrient adequacy and was more closely associated with reduced NCD risk. To test the effects of food functionality, a new compound indicator, the dietary functionality index (DFI) was developed. Application of the DFI to our population showed significant trends with improved health parameters, providing novel support for the functionality of indigenous foods towards health maintenance. From comparative ethnobotanical surveys, five plant species that were used in one community significantly more often than another were selected for laboratory analysis to assess whether differential consumption patterns might explain disparate rates of NCD. Crude extracts of betel quid (BQ), comprised of areca nut (AN; Areca catechu L.) and Piper betle L. inflorescence (PBI), guava bud (GB; Psidium guajava L.), noni (Morinda citrifolia L.) and mangrove bean (MB; Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (L.) Lam.) were tested for their ability to mediate glucose transport in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, their antioxidant activity, their capacity to prevent Cu2+-catalyzed low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation or reduce the cytotoxicity of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) towards cultured bovine aorta endothelial cells (BAEC). Our results demonstrate that BQ and its constituents AN and PBI inhibit insulin action while GB and noni mimic or potentiate it, suggesting that consumption of the latter offsets the diabetogenicity of the former. Betel quid was also highly toxic towards BAEC and exacerbated oxLDL cytotoxicity, despite being a potent free radical scavenger. In contrast, GB and the root of noni (NR) were able to inhibit LDL oxidation and effectively protected BAEC. Our findings suggest that communities who consume more plants that possess antiatherogenic and/or antidiabetic functionality, which in itself is contingent on adequate dietary diversity, may be protected from NCD risk. This has important implications for public health policies aimed at reinforcing traditional food habits as a strategy to lessen the NCD burden that is usually associated with economic development.</description><creator>Owen, Patrick.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Functional foods -- Papua New Guinea.</subject><subject>Nutrition -- Papua New Guinea.</subject><subject>Ethnobotany -- Papua New Guinea.</subject><subject>Phytochemicals -- Health aspects -- Papua New Guinea.</subject><title>Functional diversity of indigenous diets in coastal Papua New Guinea : role in the nutrition transition and noncommunicable disease risk</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1n79h8023.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dj52w823r</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3t945v44b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:59:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation examined the influence of room acoustic variations on listener loudspeaker preferences in multichannel audio reproduction, and the extent to which listeners adapt to the room acoustics. Listener preferences among 4 different 5-channel loudspeaker systems were observed in 4 different virtual listening rooms via a binaural room scanning (BRS) measurement and playback system. To study room acoustic adaptation, 2 groups of listeners evaluated identical stimuli according to 2 different trial blocking schemes, termed either the successive or the intermixed treatment. In the successive treatment condition, the loudspeakers were evaluated under a given room acoustic condition before moving to the next block of trials, under a different room acoustic condition. In the intermixed treatment condition, the loudspeakers were evaluated under a different room acoustic condition on each trial within a given block of trials. Although loudspeaker preferences did not differ between these two different trial-blocking schemes, there was a significant influence of room acoustics on loudspeaker preferences. The room acoustic variation to which listeners were exposed also significantly influenced the observed patterns of loudspeaker preferences. These results can be summarized simply as follows: The most reflective listening room produced the lowest overall preference ratings, and also enabled listeners to report the largest differences in loudspeaker preference. It was also found that experienced listeners were more discerning of loudspeaker effects, whereas less experienced listeners were more influenced by room effects. The results indicate that both listening experience and room acoustics significantly influence how listeners formulate loudspeaker preferences.</description><creator>Olive, Sean E.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Loudspeakers.</subject><subject>Music -- Acoustics and physics.</subject><title>Interaction between loudspeakers and room acoustics influences loudspeaker preferences in multichannel audio reproduction</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cn69m7577.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3t945v44b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Schulich School of Music</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:44558h73m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:59:44Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis discusses 3D seismic exploration for hydrothermal dolomite (HTD) reservoirs. During this project, I utilized some of the existing algorithms as well as developed my own methods. I mentioned that HTD reservoirs constitute an important hydrocarbon play-type the world over, and are particularly important within the Ordovician aged Trenton-Black River Group in eastern North America. I noted that 3D seismic is the best tool to explore for HTD but it is adversely affected by random noise and acquisition footprint which must be attenuated. I designed a post-stack processing flow that can be applied to attenuate noise, highlight fault terminations, and increase reflection events continuity. By predicting porosity using seismic attributes, I examined the relationships between porosity distribution and faulting, and between porosity and seismic attributes. Results show that porosity development depends on basement-related faults, and that hydrocarbon production rate depends on the presence of faults, fractures and porosity. The results show that the sag observed to be associated with HTD reservoirs on seismic sections is due to velocity pull-down and that the best porosity is developed in these areas. The methods and results presented in this project can be used in other places with similar geologic settings. By way of semblance, I developed a dual-parameter scanning algorithm that can recover both NMO velocity (vnmo) and the effective anisotropic parameter (etaeff) at the same time, from which interval eta (etaint) is obtained by inversion. Noise-free synthetic data application show 10% maximum deviation between the extracted and actual flint values, while noise-contaminated synthetic data show &gt;20% deviation. Real data application shows that it is possible to discriminate between HTD and limestone. Further testing is required to establish its validity. A velocity ratio (Vp/Vs) extracting algorithm was developed using AVO prestack amplitude inversion. Noise-free synthetic data application shows &lt;11% maximum error between the scanned and the actual Vp/Vs values, while the noisy data deviation is 22%. Real data application indicates a distinction between HTD and limestone. Testing with other real data sets is required to validate the usefulness of the method.</description><creator>Ogiesoba, Osareni Christopher.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Seismic prospecting -- Trenton Group.</subject><subject>Petroleum -- Prospecting -- Trenton Group.</subject><subject>Three-dimensional imaging.</subject><subject>Geomorphology -- Saint Clair, Lake, Region (Mich. and Ont.).</subject><subject>Hydrocarbons -- Saint Clair, Lake, Region (Mich. and Ont.).</subject><title>Seismic exploration methods for hydrothermal dolomite reservoirs : a case study of the Trenton-Black River Groups</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3n204268c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/44558h73m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5q47rs465</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:59:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Pain and depression are universally linked: people with depression often complain of pain, and those suffering from persistent pain are at an increased risk for depression. The present investigation explores the potential role of progesterone metabolism in both pain and depression. The first manuscript describes the effect of olfactory bulbectomy (a model of depression in the rat linked to changes in progesterone metabolism) on formalin-induced pain. Pain was increased in bulbectomized rats in the second phase of the formalin test. Two-week treatment with amitriptyline did not affect pain responses, while fluoxetine was antinociceptive in both olfactory bulbectomized and control rats. The second manuscript describes antinociceptive properties of six progesterone metabolites administered systemically to rats. 3alpha-reduced metabolites produced a biphasic response. Pain was reduced at low doses and this was reversed at higher doses. The dihydroprogesterones produced a similar effect but with lower potency. Their effect was reversed by indomethacin, indicating that their conversion to 3alpha-reduced metabolites was required for nociception. 3alpha-reduced metabolites were inactive. All antinociceptive effects were reversed by bicuculline. The physiological levels of ring A-reduced progesterone metabolites in the rat are not established. Manuscript 3 addresses the treatment of standards used in immunoassays: ethanol and plastic pipet tips should be avoided since they inflate measured values of standards and cause underestimation of analyte levels. Manuscript 4 describes the development of a competitive binding assay with colorimetric detection, which---at desired sensitivity---outperformed the commonly used radioimmunoassay in terms of precision, sample processing time and overall cost. The limit of detection ranged from 6 pg for progesterone and pregnanolone to 54 pg for epipregnanolone, and imprecision was 12%. Normal levels of progesterone and its metabolites were measured in male rat plasma. The most abundant were 5alpha-dihydroprogesterone and pregnanolone, followed by progesterone, allopregnanolone, isopregnanolone, epipregnanolone and 5beta-dihydroprogesterone. The levels of 5beta-reduced metabolites had previously not been measured and were believed not to be naturally occurring metabolites in rats. The measured levels of other compounds were in agreement with reports measuring some of the metabolites by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or highly specific RIA.</description><creator>Ocvirk, Rok.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Pain -- physiopathology.</subject><subject>Receptors, GABA-A -- drug effects.</subject><subject>Pregnanolone -- metabolism.</subject><subject>5-alpha-Dihydroprogesterone -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Depression -- physiopathology.</subject><title>Ring A-reduced progesterone metabolites : potential link between pain and depression and measurement of physiological concentrations</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f4752m473.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5q47rs465</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:jq085p74w</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:59:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Endothelial cells are key regulators of physiological functions as well as important determinants of atherosclerosis. Many endothelial cell activities are influenced by the reverse cholesterol transport lipoprotein HDL, and histologically, endothelial cells are resistant to cholesterol accumulation. In this thesis, we explore the endothelial response to cholesterol treatment and examine the role of three cholesterol efflux proteins, ABCA1, ABCG1, and SR-BI, in endothelial cholesterol efflux to HDL. Using DNA microarrays, we found cholesterol treatment of endothelial cells results in coordinated downregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis genes and upregulation of the putative cholesterol efflux protein ABCG1. ABCA1 was not highly expressed in endothelial cells under basal or cholesterol-treated conditions and endothelial cells could not use apoA-I as a cholesterol efflux acceptor. Despite our observation that ABCG1 mRNA is highly upregulated by cholesterol and oxysterol treatment in endothelial cells, ABC inhibition using glyburide had no effect on cholesterol efflux to HDL3, suggesting ABC transporters are not required for endothelial cholesterol efflux. Heterologous expression of V5-epitope-tagged ABCG1 in COS cells did not result in increased cholesterol efflux to HDL3, whereas expression of ABCA1 did. Use of the tagged ABCG1 also allowed us to study the subcellular localization of ABCG1 using confocal microscopy. The HDL receptor SR-BI was expressed in our model endothelial cells, however, cholesterol treatment downregulated this protein. Futhermore, treatment of endothelial cells with the SR-BI inhibitor BLT-1 had no effect on efflux to HDL3. We conclude that endothelial cells have a significant capacity for cholesterol efflux that is independent of these efflux proteins' expression or activity.</description><creator>O'Connell, Brian, 1976-</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Cholesterol -- metabolism.</subject><subject>ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters -- physiology.</subject><subject>Endothelial Cells -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Lipoproteins, HDL -- physiology.</subject><title>Cellular physiology of cholesterol efflux in endothelial cells</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rx913t43z.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jq085p74w</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Experimental Medicine</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bv73c418c</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:59:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The application of transmit diversity techniques such as Space-Time Block Coding (STBC) to the downlink of multiuser wireless communications systems has received considerable attention. The main advantage of such an approach is its ability to provide diversity gains through the use of multiple antennas only at the transmitting side without significantly increasing the complexity at the receiving end. Among the many multiple access techniques proposed, Multi-Carrier (MC) and Direct Sequence (DS) Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) techniques are known as the most promising candidates for future broadband mobile communication networks. In MC and DS-CDMA systems or combination thereof, employing transmit diversity, the spatial diversity gains can only be realized if the underlying channels are accurately acquired at the receiver. Furthermore, such systems suffer from high computational complexity which should be properly addressed for practical implementations. Motivated by these observations, in the first part of this dissertation, we introduce the chip-level ST block coding scheme for DS-CDMA systems. For this scheme, we address the problems of single-user detection as well as blind channel estimation, and we show that chip-level coding does not suffer from antenna order ambiguity. Moreover, we demonstrate that chip-level schemes exhibit low decoding delay and allow for the design of adaptive single-user detectors with improved short data-record performance characteristics compared to their symbol-level counterparts. In the second part of this dissertation, we present a novel transmission scheme for the downlink of MC-CDMA systems with transmit diversity that is based on chip-level Space-Frequency (SF) block coding. For this scheme, we investigate the problem of blind channel estimation when the received signal processing is done (i) pre-Fast Fourier Transform (FFT); and (ii) post-FFT. We propose two blind channel estimation algorithms based on subspace and Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) principles. Moreover, we present an analytical performance analysis of the proposed algorithms by investigating the bias as well as the finite data record mean-square error of the channel estimates. Our analysis shows that SFBC MC-CDMA systems do not suffer from antenna order ambiguity. In addition, to benchmark the accuracy of our estimation algorithms, we derive the corresponding Cramer-Rao bounds (CRB) based on a novel approach that assumes the knowledge of only the spreading code of the desired user. Our approach has the advantage of providing lower bounds which are tighter than the CRBs with known signatures. We also study the problem of single user detection for downlink transmissions to address the issue of multiuser interference. In the case of the post-FFT approach, we take advantage of the SFBC-induced signal structure to derive linear single-user detectors with improved performance in short data-record situations. Finally, in order to address the issue of computational complexity, we exploit the structure of the covariance matrix of the received signal to simplify the computations involved in estimating the channel, and forming the detector.</description><creator>Nayeb Nazar, Shahrokh.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Wireless communication systems.</subject><subject>Code division multiple access.</subject><title>Blind channel estimation and single-user detection for multi-carrier and spread-spectrum systems with transmit diversity</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/sn00b228x.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bv73c418c</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:hm50tw119</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:59:47Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The erosion of copper cathodes having different microstructures ranging from hundreds of nm to tens of mum were studied in both pulsed vacuum arcs and continuous running magnetically rotated atmospheric pressure arcs. Cathodes having different grain sizes were formed by various thermal spray and heat treatment methods namely, high-velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) method, atmospheric pressure plasma spraying (PS), vacuum plasma spraying (VPS), cold spraying (CS) and annealing techniques. The coatings produced were characterized for their chemical composition, oxide content, microstructure, porosity and thermal conductivity. Arc velocity and erosion measurements were performed on these cathodes. The results show that, the cathodes having smaller grain sizes show higher arc velocities and hence give lower erosion rates. Annealed HVOF, CS coatings and as-sprayed VPS coatings which had grains sizes from 4 to 0.9 mum gave up to 60% higher arc velocities and up to 70% lower erosion rates than Cu cathodes having grains sizes from 20 to 23 mum. As sprayed HVOF and CS coatings spalled severely due to their poor coating adhesion strength, as well as low electrical and thermal conductivities. However annealing these coatings in inert atmosphere improved their properties and reduced spalling. Annealing conditions, which gave minimum or no spalling of the coatings, were determined. The effect of coating initial thickness on erosion rates was also determined. Microstructural analysis of the coated cathodes after erosion experiments show that the initial grain size of the coatings remain intact even after erosion experiments.</description><creator>Rao, Lakshminarayana.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Copper -- Microstructure.</subject><subject>Copper -- Erosion.</subject><subject>Cathodes -- Deterioration.</subject><title>Effect of cathode microstructure on erosion of copper cathodes : an experimental study</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cv43p179r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hm50tw119</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1c18dk22m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:59:48Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In mammalian cells, two main membrane trafficking pathways, the secretory and endocytic pathways are important for many biological functions. Secretory proteins are synthesized on ribosomes inside the cells, translocated into the ER for proper folding, later mature in the Golgi and continue their journey to the plasma membrane. Endocytosis is defined as a process of vesicle formation from the plasma membrane, where external solutes like nutrients, growth factors and transmembrane proteins are internalized by the cell to endosomal compartments. Internalized protein can either be degraded in lysosomes or recycled back to the plasma membrane. Clathrin mediated endocytosis (CME) is one of the most commonly used endocytic mechanisms in mammalian cells and its mechanism has been intensively studied over the years. Clathrin with the help of other adaptor/accessory proteins are able to form vesicles in the plasma membrane which are removed from the membrane by dynamin. There are many other kinds of internalization pathways which include phagocytosis, macropinocytosis, caveolae-dependent endocytosis, and caveolae and clathrin-independent endocytosis. In the first part of the thesis, we characterized a newly identified WVQF motif containing, AP2-binding protein, NECAP1 in neurons. We found that NECAP1 plays a vital role in the CME of transferrin and synaptotagmin in neuronal cells. In the second part, we studied endocytosis of nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor (TrkA) in PC 12 cells. At a low dose (1 ng/ml) of NGF, we found that CME of TrkA is AP2- and NECAP1-independent in PC12 cells and that beta arrestin 1 can act as an alternate adaptor for its internalization. At higher extracellular concentration of NGF, uptake is clathrin- and dynamin- and beta-arrestin 1-independent, but requires actin, Cdc42 and sphingolipids, suggesting a different pathway. Our results show that large extracellular concentrations of NGF lead to strong signals of finite duration which is later terminated by degradation of NGF or NGF-TrkA whereas low concentrations of NGF leads to long lived signals. In the third chapter, we characterized newly identified Rabs, mainly Rab18 and Rab43. We found that Rab18 is involved in COPI independent trafficking of cargo beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (Galtase)-YFP suggesting its role in retrograde trafficking from Golgi to ER, whereas Rab43 has a regulatory role in the interaction between microtubule and pre-Golgi intermediates possibly via interaction with motor proteins. Taken together, the data in this thesis contribute to our understanding of the endocytic and secretory pathways of mammalian cells.</description><creator>Murshid, Ayesha.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Endocytosis.</subject><subject>Adaptor Protein Complex 2 -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Clathrin -- metabolism.</subject><subject>Neurons -- physiology.</subject><title>Membrane trafficking and endocytosis in neurons</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vh53x040f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1c18dk22m</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:p5547w04s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:59:49Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The computational model of Quantum Finite Automata has been introduced by multiple authors (e.g. [38, 44]) with some variations in definition. The objective of this thesis is to understand what class of languages can be recognized by these different variations, and how many states are required. We begin by showing that we can use algebraic automata theory to characterize the language recognition power of QFAs. Algebraic automata theory associates to each language a canonical syntactic monoid, and the algebraic structure of this monoid becomes a meaningful parameter in describing language classes. We show that the class of languages recognized by Latvian QFAs [3] corresponds exactly to boolean combinations of languages recognized by Brodsky and Pippenger's QFA model [20], which correspond exactly to those languages whose syntactic monoid is in the class BG. Known results give us a decision procedure for testing membership in this language class. We also use algebraic automata theory to give nearly tight upper and lower bounds on the class of languages recognized by Brodsky and Pippenger's QFAs. We then extend a number of lower bound techniques known for Kondacs and Watrous' 1-way QFA model to Nayak's Generalized QFA. Both of these models are related in that they are permitted to halt before reading the entire input, allowing them to recognize certain languages whose syntactic monoid lies outside of BG. Finally, we investigate the question of QFA succinctness. It is known that QFAs can recognize some languages using exponentially fewer states compared to deterministic finite automata. We extend results from [16] to show that the word problem over abelian groups has this property. We also give example of interesting noncommutative languages with this property.</description><creator>Mercer, Mark.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Formal languages.</subject><subject>Sequential machine theory.</subject><title>Applications of algebraic automata theory to quantum finite automata</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9880vv472.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p5547w04s</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n870zv19n</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:59:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this program of research was to explore commitment-motivated relationship maintenance processes and the motivational bases of commitment to romantic relationships. In regards to the former, I was primarily concerned with demonstrating that commitment impacts not only behavioural and cognitive relationship maintenance responses, but that it also affects basic perceptual processes in relationships. In regards to the latter, I was particularly interested in utilizing self-determination theory (SDT; Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000) to distinguish between intrinsic and identified relationship motives by demonstrating that identified motives form the basis of commitment to romantic relationships and therefore promote relationship maintenance responses. Study 1 examined benign appraisals of partner transgressions as a commitment motivated relationship maintenance response. It also examined whether these appraisals mediate the established relationship between commitment and the relationship maintenance response termed accommodation. Commitment was associated with the discrepancy between participant severity ratings and that of objective raters for a reported partner transgression. Commitment predicted these benign appraisals more for objectively less severe transgressions. Although the commitment-accommodation association was replicated, benign appraisals did not mediate this relationship. Study 2 examined the potential explanatory power of applying self-determination theory (SDT; Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000) to the context of romantic relationships. A large scale web survey and 6 month follow-up distinguished between intrinsic, identified, and introjected motives for being in a romantic relationship by determining their unique associations with relevant relationship characteristics, relationship maintenance responses (RMRs), and persistence. The results confirmed a crucial distinction between intrinsic and identified motives in that associations between intrinsic motives and RMRs were fully mediated by satisfaction but not commitment, whereas identified motives were not mediated by satisfaction and instead partially mediated by commitment. By contrast, introjected motives were negatively related to RMRs. However, both identified and introjected motives predicted persistence whereas intrinsic motives did not. Study 3 used an experience-sampling diary methodology to examine the impact of positive and negative relationship events on the well-being and relationship maintenance responses of individuals with intrinsic and identified motives. It was found that identified individuals exhibited positive relationship illusions and were buffered from the impact of negative events whereas intrinsically motivated individuals were not. Study 4 provided experimental evidence for the associations between the relationship motives and relationship maintaining cognitions and behaviours demonstrated in studies 2-3. This study showed that priming individuals with an identified motivation for being in their romantic relationship leads to greater self-partner integration (relative to individuals primed with intrinsic motives) and greater willingness to accommodate and sacrifice (as compared to those primed with introjected motives). In sum, the present studies have important implications for our ability to accurately predict relationship well-being, willingness to engage in relationship maintenance responses, and relationship persistence, as a function of both commitment and the relationship motives that form a basis for relationship commitment.</description><creator>Menzies-Toman, Danielle.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Man-woman relationships.</subject><subject>Interpersonal relations.</subject><subject>Commitment (Psychology)</subject><title>Self-determined relationship motives, commitment motivated cognition, and relationship maintenance processes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8910jz03c.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/n870zv19n</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2801pk851</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:59:50Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Introduction. Despite its successful history in cervical cancer screening, the false negative rate of Papanicolaou (Pap) cytology is an important concern. Testing for DNA of oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPV) could circumvent this limitation. The present thesis reports the results of the first screening round of the Canadian Cervical Cancer Screening Trial (CCCaST). Objectives. To compare the performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values) of HPV testing vs. Pap cytology in the detection of cervical cancers and their high-grade precursors and explore the impact of sampling order, test thresholds and combinations, and patient characteristics and laboratory on test performance. Methods. CCCaST is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that compares HPV testing with Hybrid Capture 2 and conventional Pap cytology as screening interventions to identify high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia among women aged 30-69 years in Montreal, Quebec, and St. John's, Newfoundland. Women with an abnormal Pap (≥atypical squamous cells) or a positive HPV (≥1 pg/ml of high-risk HPV DNA) underwent colposcopy and biopsy, as did a random sample of women with negative tests. Performance estimates were corrected for verification bias. Logistic regression modelling was used to investigate the importance of spectrum effect due to selected patient and laboratory characteristics. Results. 10,154 women were randomized. The sensitivity of HPV testing was substantially higher (94.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 84.2-100) than that of Pap cytology (55.4%, 95%CI: 33.6-77.2), albeit with a slightly lower specificity (Pap: 96.8%, 95%CI: 96.3-97.3; HPV: (94.1%, 95%CI: 93.4-94.8). Performance was unaffected by which test was performed first. Use of both tests in parallel was 100% sensitive and 92.5% specific. Triage algorithms for Pap or HPV resulted in fewer referrals but were less sensitive. Spectrum effect analysis revealed that women over 40 reporting no new sexual partner in the last year would benefit from the higher sensitivity of HPV testing, while benefiting from comparable specificity to that of Pap cytology. Conclusion. The first RCT of HPV versus Pap testing for primary screening in North America demonstrates the greater sensitivity of HPV compared to cytology. Our study supports a paradigm change in cervical cancer screening.</description><creator>Mayrand, Marie-Hélène.</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Vaginal Smears.</subject><subject>Uterine Cervical Neoplasms -- diagnosis.</subject><subject>Papillomavirus Infections -- diagnosis.</subject><subject>Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia -- diagnosis.</subject><subject>Papillomaviridae -- genetics.</subject><subject>Mass Screening -- methods.</subject><title>Randomized controlled trial of human papillomavirus testing versus Pap cytology for primary screening of cervical cancer precursors</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c534fs34d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/2801pk851</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:cv43p180h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:59:51Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The main goal of this dissertation was to investigate whether changes in sex steroid hormone levels were associated with changes in cognitive function in both healthy and clinical populations of elderly men. Study 1 was an exploratory investigation of the hormonal correlates of a wide variety of cognitive functions in healthy, older men whose mean age was 69 years. Its results demonstrated that endogenous levels of testosterone were related to performance on spatial tasks in a curvilinear fashion, while a similar curvilinear association related endogenous levels of estradiol to performance on verbal tasks. However, because of the correlational nature of the study, causation could not be determined. In order to further investigate the effects of sex steroid hormones on cognitive test performance in men, a randomized, placebo-controlled treatment study was undertaken. Study 2 was designed to investigate the individual effects of testosterone and estrogen on cognition in a clinical population of elderly men with prostate cancer who were about to be treated with a gonadotropin releasing-hormone analog (GnRH) that causes pharmacological suppression of testicular function. After 12 weeks of testicular suppression, "add-back" estrogen or placebo was randomly administered concurrent with GnRH administration for an additional 12 weeks. These pharmacologic endocrine manipulations allowed the isolation of the effects of estrogen on cognition in men with prostate cancer. In contradistinction to the hypotheses, no significant changes in cognitive performance were found in these men following 12-weeks of testicular suppression with a GnRH analog despite significant treatment-related changes in their sex hormone levels, and a detrimental effect of 12-weeks of add-back estradiol treatment was observed on verbal memory instead of the hypothesized beneficial effect. The failure to find the expected results of the hormonal manipulations on cognitive functions in the men with prostate cancer may be a result of the short duration of treatments, the oral route of estradiol administration, the confounding effects of hypogonadism on sex steroid hormone receptor responsiveness and/or comorbid health conditions on cognition. Taken together, the results of these two studies suggest that hormone-cognition relationships in both healthy men and in men with prostate cancer are complex and need to be interpreted within the context of age-related changes in sex steroid hormone dynamics and brain function.</description><creator>Matousek, Rose H.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Hormones.</subject><subject>Psychophysiology.</subject><subject>Cognition.</subject><title>The influence of sex steroid hormones on cognition in normative and clinical populations of older men /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n583xz69m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cv43p180h</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:w9505403j</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:59:52Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Recently, new findings allow us to suggest that lifelong exposure to endogenous estrogens could be a reliable predictor of the effect of exogenous estrogens on cognition and the brain. Thus explaining why women do not arrive at menopause with an equivalent susceptibility to the effects of estrogen therapy (ET) In the current thesis, studies have been designed to investigate the effect of estrogens on the brain from a new perspective by introducing new measures. Firstly, we developed a questionnaire about indices of lifelong estrogen exposure and assessed the reliability of these self-reported indices over a four year interval. Secondly, we recruited postmenopausal women and men to investigate the effects of estrogens on the brain using magnetic resonance imaging. Volumetric analyses of the hippocampus and amygdala and global automated analysis using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) were performed to assess whether current ET use as well as estrogen exposure throughout life can predict cerebral structural changes. The results demonstrate that most lifelong estrogen exposure indices were reliable with age at menopause and age at HT initiation leading to the weaker correlations. An age effect on the recall of these indices was also observed. The neuroimaging results revealed that women using ET had larger HC volumes compared to past HT users, never users and men. Moreover, we found a negative relationship between ET duration and HC volume among ET users. We confirmed these results with the VBM analysis. These results support the notion that there is a treatment duration-dependent neuroprotective role of estrogen on HC volume in aging that point toward a window of opportunity. Analysing the whole brain using VBM also demonstrated that there are sex differences and that the estrogen effects are not specific to the HC since we found that ET users compared to never users have greater grey matter concentration in the nucleus accumbens and that this effect was modulated by age at menarche and age at menopause. Overall, these results strongly suggest that lifelong endogenous and exogenous estrogen exposures have modulatory neuroprotective effect on the aging brain.</description><creator>Lord, Catherine, 1978-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Estrogen Replacement Therapy.</subject><subject>Aging -- drug effects.</subject><subject>Brain Mapping -- methods.</subject><subject>Brain -- drug effects.</subject><subject>Magnetic Resonance Imaging -- methods.</subject><title>Effect of estrogen therapy and sex on brain structures in aging : importance of lifelong endogenous and exogenous estrogen exposure</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/mp48sh22m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/w9505403j</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qn59q787q</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:59:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This dissertation concerns the estimation of unknown smooth functions in semi-parametric regression models using smoothing approaches given longitudinal data or survival data. In Chapter 1, we review the research in the literature on smoothing and regressions. We also review quantile regression and survival analysis. In Chapter 2, we propose a class of semi-parametric quantile regression models for longitudinal data from the Bayesian point of view. We also provide an estimating procedure which is implemented in the standard software WinBUGS. In Chapter 3, we study semi-parametric quantile regression models for longitudinal data with nonignorably missing covariates. In longitudinal data, it may happen that data are often missing and the missingness mechanism depends on the missing data (then said to be nonignorable). Our proposed estimating procedure can be conveniently implemented in WinBUGS. In Chapter 4, we propose a class of partly linear transformation models, which includes the proportional hazards model and the proportional odds model as special cases, for survival data. We also suggest two estimating procedures based on local polynomial smoothing and penalized smoothing splines. Our estimating procedures are demonstrated through some simulations and real examples. Chapter 5 concerns interval censored data. This type of data commonly arises in clinical trials and medical studies. The proportional hazards model and the proportional odds model are two popular models used in literature. We study a more flexible survival model via doubly penalized smoothing splines. Our proposed model allows some covariates to have nonlinear effects on the survival function of failure time. Finally, Chapter 6 summarizes our work and addresses some aspects which remain to be completed.</description><creator>Liu, Baisen.</creator><date>2008</date><subject>Smoothing (Numerical analysis)</subject><subject>Failure time data analysis.</subject><subject>Regression analysis -- Mathematical models.</subject><title>Smoothing approaches in regression</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ng451n209.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qn59q787q</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7s75dh13g</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-21T19:59:53Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Replicating data across different databases has the potential to provide low response times since data can be accessed locally, high scalability since load can be distributed, and fault-tolerance since the data can be accessed as long as one replica is available. A big challenge of database replication is to handle updates such that the entire replicated database appears as if there is only a single logical copy of the data. The standard correctness criterion for database replication is 1-copy-serializability (1-copy-SE) which guarantees that a replicated database behaves as a non-replicated database with serializability (SE), the highest isolation level for transaction execution. In this thesis, we propose a new criterion, 1-copy-snapshot-isolation (1-copy-SI), due to the popularity of snapshot isolation (SI) over serializability in major database systems. SI allows some non-serializable executions, but it provides better concurrency and can be implemented efficiently. However, current definitions of SI allow for the violation of integrity constraints while commercial implementations of snapshot isolation maintain them. Hence, we define a new isolation level SI+IC which represents the isolation level implemented in current systems. From there, we propose a criterion 1-copy-SI+IC that respects both SI and integrity constraints in a replicated database. As a second step, we develop a replication solution that provides many features. It provides 1-copy-SI+IC. It is implemented in a middleware between clients and original database system, and thus, does not require changes to the source code of the database system. Despite being at the middleware level, it provides concurrency at the record level, and thus, the same concurrency level as the database system itself. Furthermore, it provides a standard database interface, and thus, is transparent to the application. It also offers fault-tolerance. Finally, it includes protocols that are able to handle a wide-area environment. This is achieved by a careful choice of communication patterns that keep communication across the wide area network at a minimum. The approach is implemented within a middleware-based framework that allows for an easy plug-in of replication algorithms. Our solution is carefully evaluated, comparing several design alternatives. Additionally, it is compared against a traditional replication protocol, that is widely implemented in current systems. The evaluation shows that our protocols have very good performance and compare favourably with existing solutions.</description><creator>Lin, Yi, 1972-</creator><date>2007</date><subject>Database management.</subject><subject>Computer networks.</subject><subject>Fault-tolerant computing.</subject><title>Practical and consistent database replication</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jm214s79r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/7s75dh13g</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):16250</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
