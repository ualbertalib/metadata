The system employs uridine diphosphate glucuronic acid as the glucuronyl donor, with guinea pig liver microsomes providing the UDP-glucuronyltransferase. Of the substrates tested, normetanephrine, metanephrine, 3-0-methyldopamine, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenethanol, harmalol and harmol are glucuronidated. The conjugative reaction with the last two compounds forms the basis of a simple spectrophotofluorometric method for the measurement of transglucuronidating activity as weIl as of endogenous UDPGA in various tissues. Incorporation of the oxidative step, catalyzed by UDPG dehydrogenase in the presence of NAD allows the measurement of UDPG also. In addition, some hormonal effects on the hepatic concentration of UDPGA in the rat have been investigated: starvation and alloxan decrease the hepatic UDPGA while glucose, hydrocortisone and epinephrine have the opposite effect. Results with insulin injection are, however, inconsistent.</description><creator>Wong, Kim P.</creator><contributor>Sourkes, T.

The salient factors influencing a shift production schedule are controlled by both management and the mine environment. The mine system constraints reflect the inter-play of geological, geomechanical and economic factors. The management goals are considered with respect to the operating policies of draw-point and ore-bin control, and ground control, equipment allocation and ventilation systems. The integration of these various issues constitutes the mining system, which requires flexibility to achieve the production goals under changing mining environments.

[...] Secondly, the products may be only formed through a series of steps in which the free radicals play the role of an intermediate, i.e., a chain mechanism. Both kinds of mechanism are, of course, possible. In fact, they may be operative simultaneously. The task facing a physical chemist in studying the decomposition of an organic compound, therefore, not only consists of the determination of the chemical change taking place and the rate expression of the over-all process, but also whether the process comes through a rearrangement mechanism or a chain mechanism or both.

In the University and its environs Kant lived a life of diligent and brilliant scholarship, refusing proffered appointments and honours, and invitations to larger universities, in order to devote his whole energy to the lifework he set himself.

It overlies unconformably a complex of highly metamorphosed and deformed ancient rocks. The series consists of first, a basal conglomerate composed of angular fragments, second, a succession of "red" siltstone, sandstone, and arkose, all of which contain pebbles and conglomerate bands and, third, coarse loosely consolidated conglomerates composed of well-rounded fragments. Because of its similarity to the Athabaska Sandstone of Keweenawan Age, south of Lake Athabaska, the series is called the Athabaska Series. Interbedded with sandstone in a zone about halfway up the series are several bodies of highly amygdaloidal basic lava flows. Cutting the structure are narrow basic dykes. The Athabaska Series is believed to have been deposited rapidly under shallow water conditions in a semi-arid temperate climate. Though the series has been deformed and severely faulted, the sediments are in some places scarcely consolidated.</description><creator>Blake, Donald A. W.

It was found that a single a particle on hitting a zinc sulphide screen produced enough light for the flash to be registered visually. This technique could not be applied to other radiations then known (Œ≤ and Œ≥ rays) since these have considerably lower ionizing power and the energy released in the fluorescent screen was below the sensitivity of the eye. The principle however remained and awraited the appearance of a light detecting instrument more sensitive and reliable than the human eye. [...] The object of this experiment was to construct a counter employing a fluorescent screen and a commerical photo-multiplier tube, suitable for work with Œ≥ rays. Particular attention was paid to the development of practical ways of reducing the high background rate of the counter, while keeping the intrinsic efficiency at a moderately high level.</description><creator>Zirinsky, Victor J.</creator><contributor>Marshall, J.

Just how profound this influence is cannot at present be estimated, but up to now he has been without doubt the most influential writer of his time. [...] In the following paper I have therefore tried to examine impartially, in the light that is shed on them by his own poetry, the critical remarks Eliot has made concerning poetry. What emerges from this examination leads to the conclusion that there is a unity, albeit qualified, in Eliot's writings as a whole. [...] I have approached the subject largely from the critical side of Eliot's writings not only because deduction is a more reliable method than induction but also because - etiam disiecti membra poetae notwithstanding - dissection is less damaging to criticism than to poetry.</description><creator>MacCallan, William David.</creator><contributor>Klein, A.

Many have hoped to define how gammaaminobutyric acid, GABA, a substance that has among the various tissues studied a unique occurrence in the vertebrate nervous system, may be related at a molecular level to the inhibitory process which "is accompanied by a stabilization of membrane polarization in a manner which blocks the depolarizing action of excitatory impulses acting upon the same postsynaptic membrane. This may be called repolarization or hyperpolarization... The essential fact is that the inhibitory process in all nerve cells counteracts the depolarizing action of excitatory processes to maintain the polarization of a cell at an equilibrium level near that of its resting value" [...]</description><creator>Strasberg, Paula M.</creator><contributor>Elliott, K.

In epithelia, the stained layer was usually interrupted where two adjacent plasma membranes fused to form tight junctions. This finding indicated that the layer was not part of the plasma membrane itself but rather a "cell coat" located on its outer surface.

That some survived this operation is shown by the evidence of repair of bone in the margin of the trephined openings. The earliest records of surgical practice are discovered in the ruins of the temples and monuments. [...]</description><creator>Najjar, Talib A.</creator><contributor>Kahn, D.

If administered in excess amounts, it modifies carbohydrate and fat metabolism and the activities of some enzymes. A dietary deficiency of this essential amino acid results in attenuated growth, and alterations in the metabolism of certain substances. Within the protein molecule, tryptophan is believed to play a role as an intermediate in some enzymic reactions. [...]</description><creator>Madras, Bertha K.</creator><contributor>Sourkes, T.
