Due to its particular location in the social and cultural geography of Montreal, the Main, which symbolically divides the working-class Francophone east and the Anglophone bourgeois west, has developed as a mixed-use commercial artery, an eclectic border zone of a bilingual, multi-ethnic city. The heterogeneous character of the Main is reflected in its material landscape---with its old and now largely re-used garment sweat-shops and labour halls, theatres of the red-light district, cafes, and the shops and restaurants of the mid-twentieth century immigrant shopping corridor. Shaped by the diversity of the populations that came to live, work, protest, shop or be entertained in these sites, it is an example of the social and cultural diversity of the metropolis. Such heterogeneous sites have often been interpreted as liminal spaces, but this research demonstrates that the construction and experience of the Main as a border zone have rarely been gender neutral. While physical, social and cultural heterogeneity are components of this landscape, these sites also attest to the importance of gender relations in the experience of the Main as a place of work and social life and, ultimately, as a space of representation. Its border status has often been represented through discourses and images of 'marginal' womanhood, articulated in terms of social, occupational, political, sexual and/or ethnic identity. Many of its locales, moreover, have been sites where women entered urban public life in contentious and distinctive ways. As a place that highlights the social and cultural heterogeneity of a supposedly 'divided' city, the Main is an ideal site from which to explore how ethnicity, language, class, occupation and sexual identity intersect with gender in the experience and representation of urban life. This thesis examines how a multiplicity of female gender identities have been defined and contested along the Main over the past century. It contributes to a broad literature on geographies of gender, difference and urban public cultures through an analysis of the relationships between feminist spatial metaphors and the material production of urban space. Through a series of events that move through time and sections of St. Lawrence, I examine how portions of the landscape of this boulevard have been marked by the enactment of specific sets of gender relations and forms of representation that became central to civic debates regarding gender. I argue that the construction and experience of the Main as a border zone has involved the production of specific relations of gender, alterity and space. A variety of qualitative methods and archival sources are used to illustrate the importance of representations of gender to the production of this place and to illustrate how women have experienced and made use of material sites to express their specific occupational, cultural, religious, social or sexual identities. This thesis demonstrates the crucial role played by the border zones of urban public cultures in the construction of female identities that depart from dominant gender norms in the expression of social, cultural and sexual differences.</description><creator>Podmore, Julie.</creator><contributor>Ray, Brian K.

Oxide physicochemical properties are affected by the proportion of Fe and Al, the Fe/Al ratio. Five amorphous oxides containing Fe and/or Al were synthesised: "Fe" (only Fe); "3FeAl" (3 moles Fe per mole Al, Fe/Al = 3); "FeAl" (Fe/Al = 1); "Fe3Al" (Fe/Al = 0.3); "Al" (only Al). Kaolinite clay was also investigated along with kaolinite to which Fe-Al oxides had been added. The effect of Fe/Al ratio on these physicochemical properties was studied: (1) Specific surface area---EGME retention; (2) pH-dependent cation and anion exchange capacity---Ca(NO3)2 saturation; (3) Particle size density---sieving, pipette methods; (4) Surface charge density---potentiometric titrations. The Fe/Al ratio influenced the specific surface area: Fe and 3FeAl had significantly greater surface areas than Fe3Al and Al; FeAl exhibited the maximum surface area. The cation exchange capacity increased rapidly above pH 5, with Fe &gt; 3FeAl &gt; Al &gt; Fe3Al &gt; FeAl at pH 6 to 7. Surface charge density of low Fe/Al oxides was more sensitive to pH changes implying ≡AlOH surface hydroxyl groups are more easily protonated and de-protonated than ≡FeOH species. An open (porous) structure of loosely linked small particles was proposed with SO42- anions forming bridges between Al3+ and Fe3+ ions during oxide precipitation while inhibiting extensive crystal growth. Pb and Cu retention was measured using 24 hour batch suspension tests with varying pH and contaminant concentrations (0.5 to 25 mmol/L). Higher Fe/Al ratio oxides retained more Cu and Pb at all pH values. Cu retention (0.5 to 5 mmol/L) and Pb retention (all concentrations) followed Fe &gt; 3FeA &gt; FeAl &gt; Fe3Al &gt; Al but at 25 mmol Cu/L, only Fe accumulated more Cu. However, low Fe/Al ratio oxides preferentially sorbed Cu over Pb from multi-contaminant solutions. Adsorption rather than bulk precipitation was the dominant accumulation mechanism. Geochemical modelling suggested surface precipitation occurred at higher contaminant concentrations. Adding oxides to kaolinite significantly increased the clay's specific surface area, surface charge density and contaminant retention capacity; higher Fe/Al ratio oxide-amended clays retained more Pb and Cu. Amorphous Fe-Al oxides substantially enhance heavy metal accumulation by soils with higher Fe/Al ratio oxides being particularly effective.</description><creator>Potter, Hugh, 1967-</creator><contributor>Yong, Raymond N.

A proportion of the familial cases (FALS) with autosomal dominant transmission was linked to chromosome 21q and the defective gene was shown to be the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase gene (SOD1). SOD1 is a ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic metalloenzyme catalyzing the dismutation of the superoxide free radical into hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen. We have screened our FALS patients for mutations in the SOD1 gene and found mutations in about 13% of the cases. All but one mutation were single base pair substitutions resulting in amino acid changes (i.e. missense mutations) predicted to produce structurally defective molecules, and some of which significantly reduced the SOD1 enzyme activity in lymphoblasts. We have also identified a two base pairs deletion, which introduces a premature stop codon at position 131 and is predicted to result in the translation of a truncated molecule. It has been hypothesized that the pathology observed in FALS cases with SOD1 mutations is due to a gain of a new deleterious function of the mutant enzyme and not to a simple loss of dismutase activity. However the exact mechanism of SOD1 toxicity is still unknown and the specificity of the degenerating cell populations remains to be addressed. In this work, we investigated whether the damage seen in ALS with SOD1 mutations results from direct motor neuron toxicity. We have generated transgenic animals carrying a human SOD1 cDNA with the G37R mutation associated with FALS, driven by the neurofilament light chain promoter in order to specifically express the mutant protein in neuronal tissues. We show that transgenic animals express high levels of the human SOD1 protein in neuronal tissues, especially in the spinal cord where the motor neurons are concentrated, but develop no apparent motor deficit at up to 2 years of age. Our animal model suggests that neuron specific expression of mutant human SOD1 might not be sufficient for the development of the disease in mice, and hints towards the involvement of additional yet unidentified cell types/mechanisms.</description><creator>Pramatarova, Albéna.</creator><contributor>Rouleau, G.

Localistic analyses, developed from motional concepts (e.g., Verkuyl 1993, Asher &amp; Sablayrolles 1994), do not extend to non-motional data (e.g., changes of state or possession) except via metaphor, thereby bypassing essential generalizations about change. It is argued that, instead of modeling change after the tripartite source-route-goal divisions of a spatial path, the various combinations of two eventive primitives---distinguished point and distinguished process---are sufficient and necessary in accounting for abstract and concrete data, including the four aspectual verb classes of states, activities, achievements and accomplishments (Vendler 1967). The medial lexical specification, route, is shown to be unnecessary, being an epiphenomenon of two distinguished points interacting, or inferable through pragmatic considerations. This is shown by examples from English and French. Event mereology unifies concrete with abstract change under a single system of features for verbs (e.g., arrive and inherit ), prepositions, and their associated phrases (in the house and in debt). Underspecification and complementation further economize the lexical representations while accounting for cases of semantic ambiguity. Such issues as homogeneity in states/processes, resultatives, aspectual verbs (continue, stop), agentivity, and the effects of aspectual coercion by English aspectual morphemes (-ed, -ing) are examined and re-formulated where necessary. The event-mereological approach is demonstrated to be compatible with various current syntactic analyses, and one such analysis (Travis 1999) is investigated in detail. Event mereology is also shown to extend to more complex aspectual patterns observed of serial verb constructions in Edo (Stewart 1998).</description><creator>Pi, Chia-Yi Tony, 1970-</creator><contributor>Gillon, Brendan (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Grammar, Comparative and general -- Aspect.</subject><title>Mereology in event semantics</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fn107086n.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/p2676x400</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Linguistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:9019s4127</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:44:14Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Human society comes in contact with the physical environment in two ways: Through economic appropriation of physical resources and through the symbolic appropriation of nature. The two 'ways' interact via the various interpreters of nature, who as they define nature create cognitive means for the appropriation of physical resources. Using the theory of social networks of power the thesis examines the above interplay of economic appropriation and symbolic manipulation of the physical environment from the Stone Age to the Hellenistic times in a series of civilisations in Eurasia. It reasons that as we move from the Stone Age to pristine civilisations we encounter two phenomena: first, a process of variation in nature's interpretation due to social stratification. Second, interpretation of nature becomes the subject matter of elite groups, the literati, firmly attached to political elites. Yet, with the advent of the Axial Age nature's interpreters become increasingly autonomous and use metaphors of nature as means to reflect on political and social issues of the day. In turn, as we can see in the case of ancient Greece, various political elites start to use particular readings of nature to consolidate their ideological position vis-a-vis their rivals. Thus, Axial Age ideologies about nature move from passive interpreters of what exists to dynamic advocates of what should exist. Thus, the wisdom of the major schools of political ecology is contested in four major issues: First, there has never been a single reading of nature, but many co-existing in geographical and social proximity. Secondly, there is no specific time when nature lost its sacredness. Instead, we detect a steady withdrawal of the divine from the physical environment starting with the emergence of reflecting thinking. Thirdly, the development of nature's symbolic attributes lies not only in its relationship to politics, but also on the internal dynamics, strength and weakness, of the discourse in itself as well as on the organisational capabilities of particular schools of thought. Lastly, economic exploitation as such does not depend on specific readings of nature. Rather, it depends on technological advances, the nexus of political and ideological social networks of power.</description><creator>Marangudakis, Manussos.</creator><contributor>Krohn, Roger (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Political ecology.</subject><subject>Human ecology.</subject><subject>Philosophy of nature -- History.</subject><title>Nature and power : a study of the social construction of nature in Eurasia from the Stone Age to the Hellenistic times</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1n79h621w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9019s4127</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Sociology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k0698917v</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:44:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The negative health effects of trans fatty acids from hydrogenated fats on plasma lipid profile have been well documented. However, the mechanisms responsible for these changes remain to be elucidated. Hence the overall objective of the thesis was to examine the effect of consuming different forms of hydrogenated fats on cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism, specifically fractional and absolute synthesis rates of free (FSR-FC and ASR-FC) and esterified (FSR-CE, AER and ER) cholesterol, and the functioning of the ASP pathway. In addition, validation of the newer deuterium incorporation (DI) method for measurement of endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis against the cholesterol precursor assessment approach was also performed. Fourteen moderately hypercholesterolemic (LDL-C ≥ 130 mg.dl-1) postmenopausal women (65--71yrs) participated in this study. Subjects consumed, in random order, each of 6 diets for 5 week periods, separated by washout periods ranging from 2 to 4 weeks in duration. The experimental diets included a baseline (BL) diet (39% kcal fat) and 5 reduced fat diets (30% kcal) where 2/3rd of the fat was either soybean oil (SO), low trans squeeze (SQM), medium trans tub (TM), high trans stick (SM) margarines, or butter (BT). Results obtained from the series of analyses performed demonstrate that: (i) the DI method and levels of some cholesterol precursors correspond as methods for the study of in vivo cholesterol biosynthesis in humans; (ii) elevations in endogenous cholesterol synthesis (FSR-FC and ASR-FC) are not responsible for the increase in circulating cholesterol levels seen after consumption of the high trans SM, and high SFA rich BT and BL diets; (iii) suppression of cholesterol esterification rates on the SM diet may account for the decreased HDL-C levels observed on this diet and finally; (iv) dysfunction of the ASP pathway, with lower ASP and higher FFA levels could be responsible for the higher secretion of hepatic B 100 particles.

His definition of the soul does not depart significantly from Avicenna's: its definition as an entelechy and a substance, its incorporeality, its pre-existence, or the role of the vital spirits---pneumata. However, he criticizes the materialism implied in a number of Avicennan theses. At issue is the ontological unity of the soul that Suhrawardi perceives to be jeopardized by the localization in the body of the representative faculties---the active and passive imaginations and the estimation---and their objects. After criticizing the "extramissive" and the "intromissive" theories of vision, Suhrawardi introduces his own illuminative theory in an effort to simultaneously account for mystical vision. He also reduces Avicenna's faculties responsible for representation to a single faculty, focusing on the soul's role in perception. Suhrawardi analyses self-knowledge, discussing the primary awareness of one's own existence, self-identity, the unmediated character of this type of knowledge, and the issue of individuation. At the conceptual level, intellection is logically prior to imagination, while discussions about the active intelligence, its functions, and the conjunction of the rational soul---the Isfahbad-light---with the active intelligence---the light principle---still remain Avicennan. Epistemological concepts such as intuition and mystical contemplation become central in the debate over the primacy of mystical knowledge over philosophical knowledge. Suhrawardi's and Avicenna's discussions about the nature of prophetic knowledge are then contrasted with the nature of mystical knowledge by introducing the negative and positive functions of the faculty of imagination, namely, its role in the particularization of universal truths and its mimetic function.

When K has three tangles, beta 1/alpha1, beta2/alpha2, beta 3/alpha3, the PSL2( C )-character variety of the triangle group Delta(alpha1, alpha 2, alpha3) includes into X¯( K). We apply this observation to make several deductions about ( p, q, r) pretzel knots. For hyperbolic (-2, 3, n) pretzel knots, we calculate the Culler-Shalen seminorms explicitly and deduce that X( K) consists of exactly two (respectively three) algebraic curves when 3∤n (respectively 3 | n). This leads to a classification of the finite and cyclic surgeries of these knots. We obtain similar results for some (-3, 3, n) pretzel knots. We classify cyclic surgeries on (-2, p, q) pretzel knots (p, q odd and positive), The (-2, 3, 7) is the only non-torus knot in this family admitting non-trivial cyclic surgeries. We show that a (p, q, 2m) pretzel knot admits at most one non-trivial finite surgery so long as 1p +1q +1m &lt;1 . Moreover, for m &lt; -1, these knots have no non-trivial finite surgeries. Combining these results with work of Delman we classify cyclic surgeries on Montesinos knots. If a non-torus Montesinos knot K admits a non-trivial cyclic surgery, then it is the (-2, 3, 7) pretzel knot and the surgery is 18 or 19. Further, if K has a non-trivial finite surgery, then it is either a (-2, p, q) pretzel knot with 5 ≤ p ≤ q odd, or else it is a (-2, 3, q) pretzel knot with q = 7 or 9.</description><creator>Mattman, Thomas W.</creator><contributor>Boyer, Steven (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Mathematics.</subject><title>The Culler-Shalen seminorms of pretzel knots /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x633f296j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5q47rq446</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:t435gf694</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:44:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The yeast SKN7 gene encodes a transcription factor that is involved in a variety of processes in cell physiology including cell wall synthesis, cell cycle progression, and oxidative stress resistance. Using a transcriptional reporter-based system, it has been demonstrated that Skn7p is regulated by the two-component osmosensor Sln1p in a manner that requires the phosphorelay molecule Ypd1p, but not the response regulator Ssk1p. Consistent with its regulation by an osmosensor, Skn7p is involved in negative regulation of the osmoresponsive HOG MAP kinase cascade. Cells lacking SKN7 and the protein serine/threonine phosphatase encoded by PTC1 are severely disabled for growth, and hyperaccumulate intracellular glycerol. The growth defect of skn7Delta ptc1Delta mutants can be bypassed by overexpression of specific phosphatase genes, or by deletion of the HOG MAP kinase pathway-encoding genes PBS2 or HOG1. MID2 was isolated in a screen designed to identify upstream regulators of Skn7p. Mid2p is an extensively O-mannosylated protein that is localized to the plasma membrane. Mutants with defective beta-1,6-glucan synthesis grow more quickly when MID2 is absent. Conversely, MID2 is essential for viability in cells lacking FKS1, the gene encoding the primary catalytic subunit of beta-1,3-glucan synthase. mid2Delta mutants are resistant to calcofluor white, a drug that interferes with cell wall chitin synthesis, while cells overexpressing MID2 are supersensitive to the drug. mid2Delta mutants have a significant reduction in stress-induced chitin synthesis, while cells overexpressing MID2 hyperaccumulate cell wall chitin. Consistent with a proposed role in sensing and responding to cell wall stress, high copy expression of specific components of the cell wall integrity MAP kinase cascade suppress various mid2Delta phenotypes, and Mid2p is essential for full activation of the Mpk1p MAP kinase during various cell wall stress and morphogenic conditions. Observations from genetic and biochemical experiments suggest that Mid2p is a regulator of the small G-protein encoded by RHO1. Deletion of MID2 is lethal to mutants lacking the Rho1p GEF Rom2p, but suppresses the low temperature growth defect of mutants lacking the Rho1p GAP Sac7p. Conversely, high copy expression of MID2 is a strong suppressor of mutants lacking TOR2, an upstream activator of Rom2p, but is toxic to sac7Delta mutants.

The components undergoing direct contact (e.g., the end-effector of a manipulator and a satellite) are modelled using the finite element method and the Lagrange multiplier technique. Special attention is paid to dynamic fidelity of contact dynamics. Contact geometric constraints and corresponding contact forces are analysed and incorporated into the dynamical equations. This model takes into account structural deformations and oscillations, friction, time-varying contact area, and repeated contact/impact. Multi-body systems, on the other hand, are handled by a modified Euler-Lagrange method based on the Natural Orthogonal Complement (NOC). Thus, the system dynamics is composed of a set of differential equations (either multi-body formulations or finite element nodal displacement formulations) subjected to sets of algebraic equations expressing kinematic or contact constraints. A systematic procedure for solving this system of equations is formulated with special emphasis on computational efficiency. This dynamic model is then used to design a composite controller which must simultaneously achieve three goals: (1) trajectory tracking, (2) force control, and (3) stabilization of the flexible degrees of freedom of the multibody system. The singular perturbation method is used to obtain two reduced order models. Subsequently, the slow subsystem is used to design a simultaneous position/force controller based on impedance control, where an optimization method is incorporated to accommodate manipulator redundancy. The fast subsystem is used to design a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) to suppress structural vibrations. A simulation environment is developed based on the above procedures and formulations for the planar case. It is used to perform dynamic and control simulations of a variety of contact scenarios involving multi-body systems. A comparative study of the results indicates that a detailed contact dynamics model may be essential for a realistic simulation of contact/impact, capture, and force control operations.</description><creator>Kim, Sun-Wook, 1966-</creator><contributor>Misra, Arun K.

The consequences of these genetic alterations are to confer a growth advantage to the cell. Three genetic mechanisms activate oncogenes or inactivate tumor suppressor genes in human neoplasms: (i) mutations, (ii) gene amplification, and (iii) chromosomal rearrangements. In many human cancers, tumor-specific chromosomal rearrangements are known to create chimeric products with the ability to transform cells. The EWS/WT1 protein is such a fusion product, resulting from a t(11;22) chromosomal translocation in Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor (DSRCT), where 265 amino acids from the amino terminus of Ewing's sarcoma protein (EWS) are fused to zinc fingers II--IV of WT1. WT1 is a tumor suppressor gene expressed in the developing and adult urogenital system. Inactivation of WT1 has been correlated with initiation of Wilms' tumor (WT), a pediatric nephroblastoma, and Denys-brash syndrome, which is characterized by severe genitourinary disorders and WT. WT1 encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor belonging to the EGR (early growth response) family of Cys2-His2 zinc finger proteins and is mutated in 5--15% of sporadic WTs. WT1 recognizes the GC-rich motif, 5'-GCGGGGGCG-3 ', as well as a (TCC)n motif, albeit with different affinities, and can affect expression of a number of genes involved in the regulation of cell proliferation or differentiation. The t(11;22)(p13;g12) chromosomal translocation involved in DSRCT produces a chimeric protein containing the potential transcriptional activation domain of EWS fused to the DNA binding domain of WT1, suggesting that it may recognize similar DNA sequences as WT1. Since the DNA binding domains of WT1 and EWS/WT1 are structurally different, we have assessed the functional consequences of the EWS/WT1 fusion. We find that the EWS/WT1 protein has a higher binding affinity for the GC-rich WT1 binding site than the WT1 product</description><creator>Kim, Jungho, 1964-</creator><contributor>Pelletier, Jerry (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Involvement of WT1 tumor suppressor gene in desmoplastic small round cell tumor</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pz50gx802.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/00000183z</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:j098zc850</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:44:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In part I of the thesis, a new class of duality symmetries amongst quantum field theories is introduced. The new class is based upon global spacetime symmetries, such as Poincare invariance and supersymmetry, in the same way as the existing duality transformations are based on global internal symmetries. An interesting feature of the new duality transformations is that they can lead to fermions as the new dual variables. Illustrations of the new duality transformations offered in the case of scalar and spin-half field theories in 1+1 space-time dimensions, as well as (1,1) and (2, 2) supersymmetric models. For (2, 2) models the new duality transformations can change whether a chiral multiplet is twisted or not. In part II of the thesis, closed forms are derived for the effective actions for free, massive fields in anti-de-Sitter space-times in arbitrary dimensions. The results have simple expressions in terms of elementary functions (for odd dimensions) or multiple Gamma functions (for even dimensions). In the case of scalar fields in two dimensional anti de-Sitter space-time, the effective action is used to argue against the quantum validity of a recently proposed classical duality relating such theories with differing masses.</description><creator>Kamela, Martin J.</creator><contributor>Burgess, C P.

Genetic studies show that Groucho plays fundamental roles in a variety of cell-differentiation events, including neurogenesis. The overall hypothesis of this thesis is that Groucho's mammalian homologues, the t̲ransducin-l̲ike E̲nhancer of split (TLE) proteins, are general transcriptional co-repressors important in regulating a variety of cell differentiation events in mammals. The main goal of these studies was to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying TLE function. Groucho binds to Drosophila H̲airy/E̲nhancer of split (HES) bHLH proteins to repress the transcription of genes that promote neuronal fate. TLEs and mammalian HES proteins are shown here to also physically interact. Along with the co-expression of TLE and mammalian HES proteins in neural precursor cells undergoing neuronal differentiation, these results suggest that mammalian TLE/HES complexes function in a manner resembling their Drosophila counterparts. The present studies also show that both TLEs and HES proteins interact functionally with members of the Runt-related protein family, termed the Cbfa proteins. Moreover, TLE and HES proteins are shown to antagonistically contribute towards modulating Cbfa's transactivating ability. Further studies show that TLEs oligomerize and contain two separate transcription repression domains. The TLE oligomerization domain and the amino-terminal repression domain overlap, suggesting that multimerization contributes to the repressive abilities of TLEs. Finally, functional similarities between Groucho/TLEs and the yeast general transcriptional co-repressor, TUP1, were investigated. Groucho and the Drosophila Engrailed homeodomain protein are known to directly interact and repress transcription together. Similarity, TUP1 forms a complex with SSN6 and both TUP1 and SSN6 directly interact with the homeodomain factor alpha2 to repress transcription. TLEs are shown here to complex with UTY/X, mammalian proteins related to the yeast protein SSN6. Furthermore, both TLE and UTY/X are shown to interact with mammalian Engrailed proteins. Taken together, these studies strongly suggest that TLEs are general transcriptional co-repressors that perform analogous developmental functions to Drosophila Groucho and exhibit molecular mechanisms of transcriptional repression similar to those of yeast TUPI.</description><creator>Grbavec, Diane C.</creator><contributor>Stifani, S.

Current research in telehealth focuses on the evaluation of applications and projects, on the competitiveness of the telehealth industry, and on its role in international development. In contrast, this dissertation contextualizes telehealth in social history and theory. In so doing, it adopts an analytical, cultural studies approach rather than an empirical one. It also studies the extent of citizen involvement in current telehealth initiatives in Canada. More specifically, the dissertation examines whether the forms of involvement promoted by telehealth initiatives empower Canadian citizens. The examination is conducted through a five-step process. The first four steps involve an overview of the following: (1) histories of medical technology; (2) critiques of medical technology; (3) history and critique of the Canadian health care system; (4) critiques of information and communications technology and policy. The fifth step consists in mapping out the current state of telehealth development in Canada, including policy, applications and projects, as well as distinguishing the main roles of citizens in such initiatives. In closing, ways of achieving citizen empowerment through telehealth are suggested, whether it is found to be achieved in recent initiatives or not. Theoretical frameworks with the aim of positioning new technology in order that it may accomplish social change and citizen empowerment are put forward as an innovative means of evaluating current telehealth applications and projects in Canada.</description><creator>Gideon, Valerie.</creator><contributor>Szanto, George (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Medical care -- Canada.</subject><subject>Telecommunication in medicine -- Canada.</subject><title>Telehealth and citizen involvement</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/br86b5008.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/vq27zq22p</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Graduate Communications Program</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ht24wk971</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:44:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We study the effect of the thermal background on the mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis. Firstly, we model the effect of collisions by solving the Schrodinger equation in presence of a potential representing the bubble of phase transition of the Higgs field and a series of delta functions simulating the collisions amongst the particles. We validate this technique in chapter 2 by comparing it to the results obtained by application of the Born approximation. Later, we apply this "delta functions recurency technique" to the case of relativistic particles by solving the Dirac equation in the precense of similar potentials. In the second part of this thesis, we attempt to model the interaction by a totally distinct formalism that incorporates the effect of the exchange of momentum during a collision between the particles of the thermal background. To this end, we begin by describing a preexisting method for predicting the evolution of the density matrix of a system subjected to an interaction. Then we expend it in order to model the effect of the thermal background on baryogenesis. Lastly, we apply the "density matrix formalism" to the case of relativistic particles.</description><creator>Girard, Patrick, 1971-</creator><contributor>Cline, James (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Physics, Elementary Particles and High Energy.</subject><title>De la baryogénèse électrofaible et de l'effet du plasma environnant sur l'asymétrie baryonique de l'univers</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/k930bz974.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ht24wk971</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8c97ks13p</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:44:19Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The principal subject of this thesis is the place of emotion in Buddhist practice.

Significant changes in zeta-potential were observed in some cases as a result of contact (conditioning) with a second mineral. As a function of pH when sphalerite was conditioned with pyrite, the zeta-potential increased to ca. pH 9 and decreased above this pH. For sphalerite conditioned with galena, the zeta-potential decreased below pH 5, increased between pH 5 to 9 and decreased above pH 9. Galena conditioned with sphalerite and pyrite resulted in a decrease in zeta-potential below pH 5 and an increase above this pH. The results are interpreted on the basis of galvanic interactions. The mineral with the lower rest potential preferentially oxidizes and the ions released migrate and influence the zeta-potential. Measurements made in solutions of various suspected released ions generally supported the galvanic model. The zeta-potential results for mixed sulphide minerals were correlated with settling velocity. For the pyrite/galena, sphalerite/pyrite and sphalerite/galena systems, the pH of maximum settling rate corresponded to the zeta-potential of both minerals approaching zero. When the minerals were oppositely charged the conditions remained (relatively) dispersing. In the case of silica and sphalerite/silica at around pH 2 and 8.5 sphalerite homocoagulated and some silica was dispersed; from ca. pH 3 to 7, the system heterocoagulated; and above pH 9.5 the suspension was dispersed. This behavior did not correlate with the behaviour of the minerals alone. In the presence of calcium ions, from ca. pH 2 to 7, the sphalerite homocoagulated and the silica was dispersed while above pH 7 heterocoagulation was observed. This behavior did correlate more closely with that of minerals alone. The zeta-potential measurements provided only a partial interpretation: a force of attraction between sphalerite and silica appears to exist at moderately alkaline pH. An electrostatic origin to the attractive force due to the large difference in zeta-potential for sphalerite and si The settling results for the sphalerite/silica system were Correlated with AFM measurements. For silica alone, the interaction was repulsive at pH 6.2 and 8.3. This behavior did correlate with the settling tests. In the presence of calcium ions, the interaction was repulsive at pH 6.1 and 9.6 and was attractive at pH 11.4. This behavior also correlated with the settling data. For the mixed system, the interaction was repulsive at pH 7.2, 8.4 and 10.6 and was attractive at pH 9.6. The behavior at pH 8.4 and 10.6 correlated with the settling tests but not at pH 7.2 and 9.6. The lack of correlation is discussed.</description><creator>DiFeo, Anthony.</creator><contributor>Finch, J. A.

Based on the comparison of the pure component and correlation spectra extracted from chocolate syrup and aqueous sugar solutions based models, it was determined that the tightness of the concentration ranges and the ratios of the sugars in the chocolate syrup samples did not allow to draw adequate information to build a robust PLS calibration model. PLS regression models developed using infrared spectra of chocolate syrup calibration standards prepared by addition of sugar solutions to increase the concentration range did not yield conclusive results. A different approach used for standard preparation consisted of diluting chocolate syrup samples to different degrees. This new method provided an increased concentration range for the sugars but maintained an almost constant sugar to sugar ratios. The PLS models based on these new calibration standards yielded high calibration correlation coefficients and low errors on the external validation. Accuracy, repeatability, long-term stability and ruggedness were tested and the results demonstrated that the calibration models were robust and had a better repeatability than the reference high-performance liquid chromatography method. The fact that the calibration model was developed using standards having very similar sugar profiles precluded its use for the analysis of chocolate syrup samples of different formulations. The resulting formulation-specific PLS regression model required a preclassification step to ensure that the model is applied to the appropriate sample type. A probabilistic neural network (PNN) model was developed to fulfill the preclassification requirement. PNN yielded excellent classification results.

Cmv1 is an autosomal dominant non-H-2 locus mapping to mouse chromosome 6 and controls early viral replication in the spleen of infected host. The Cmv1 gene has two alleles in inbred mouse strains: the dominant Cmv1r allele (low titer; resistant) found in C57BL backgrounds and the recessive Cmv1s allele (high titer; susceptible) in BALB/c, A/J and DBA/2J strains. Resistance to MCMV is attributed to the activity of Natural Killer (NK) cells, important players in innate immunity to viral infections. In an effort to clone the Cmv1 locus, a positional cloning approach was undertaken. The work presented in this thesis applies this approach to the cloning of Cmv1. We describe the generation of a high-resolution linkage map of mouse chromosome 6 in the vicinity of the Cmv1 gene by following the segregation of 45 markers in 2248 backcross mice derived from Cmv1r and Cmv1s strains. A genetic interval of 0.7 cM was determined to contain Cmv1 . In addition, tightly linked markers to Cmv1 were identified. Secondly, we assembled a YAC/BAC contig of the Candidate region spanning ~3Mb of genomic DNA. An STS content map was generated and anchored 71 markers on a total of 98 genomic Clones. Cloning of novel polymorphic markers established a genetic interval of 0.35 cM for Cmv1. Restriction analysis of genomic clones was performed to generate a physical map of the region. In addition, a transcript map was established where 14 genes and 14 potential transcripts were identified and mapped on the YAC/BAC contig. Finally, potential candidates Ly49a, Ly49c and Ly49g genes were shown to cosegregate with Cmv1 and were subjected to functional analysis by studying their Cell surface expression during MCMV infection and performing selective in vivo antibody depletion of NK Cell subsets expressing the receptors to assess their contribution to resistan</description><creator>Depatie, Chantal.</creator><contributor>Gros, Philippe (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Vidal, Silvia (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><title>Genetic, molecular and functional analysis of the region encompassing the Cmvl host resistance gene</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/c247dt768.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nk322g026</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0z708z455</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:44:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We develop a theory of probabilistic continuous processes that is meant ultimately to be part of an interactive systems theory.

We prove that bisimulation is characterized by a very simple logic that neither involves negation nor infinite conjunction. We have a similar result for simulation between discrete processes. Moreover, these characterizations are used to construct two algorithms, one that decides whether two finite-state probabilistic processes are bisimilar, and another that decides whether a state simulates another. We show how to approximate any continuous process with finite-state processes, and that one can reconstruct the process from its approximations. These finite approximations can be as close as we want to the original process. Moreover, we define a family of metrics that can tell how far apart or how close two processes are. The metrics also witness the fact that the approximations converge to the original process. Finally, we prove that the processes where the transition graph is a tree and whose transition probabilities are all rational form a basis of the space of labelled Markov processes; this means that labelled Markov processes form a separable metric space.</description><creator>Desharnais, Josée.</creator><contributor>Panangaden, Prakash (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Labelled Markov processes</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3f462718g.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0z708z455</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:37720f521</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:44:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In this thesis, we addressed different issues related to drug exposure as it may bear on the estimates of risk in the context of hypertension treatment. A cohort of 19,501 subjects initiating therapy for uncomplicated hypertension was identified from Saskatchewan Health databases. In a first study aimed at documenting the equivalence of the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, we found that medical visits and hospitalizations following treatment initiation were lower among patients initially dispensed enalapril and lisinopril relative to captopril. Baseline characteristics could not be ruled out as possible explanations but variability in the outcomes suggest that ACE inhibitors may not be equivalent in all respects. Due to concerns about the appropriateness of using initial treatment as the exposure, patterns of use of antihypertensive were examined longitudinally in the second manuscript using the same cohort. ACE inhibitors, followed by calcium antagonists and beta-blockers, were the most commonly prescribed agents to initiate therapy for hypertension. Compliance with therapy was found to decrease over time with only 28% of patients still being compliant after seven years. In addition, 89% of patients underwent at least one modification to therapy, interrupted treatment being the most frequently encountered. Important differences were also found across agents with regard to compliance, type and timing of treatment modifications. The third manuscript reports on a case-control study assessing the association between antihypertensive drug use and the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). Overall, 812 cases of MI were identified using hospital discharge data and death certificates. Four controls were matched to each case on entry date and time at risk of an event. Compared with beta-blockers, current use of calcium antagonists was associated with an increased risk of MI (RR = 2.3; 95% Cl = 1.7--3.1). The risk ratio for ACE inhibitors was 1.3 (95% Cl = 1.0</description><creator>Bourgault, Chantal.</creator><contributor>Suissa, Samy (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Health Sciences, Pharmacology.</subject><title>Antihypertensive drugs : patterns of use and biases in the estimation of myocardial infarction risk</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/f4752j46d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/37720f521</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3484zj46h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:44:21Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Cable bolt supports are widely used as ground support in underground hard rock and coal mines. During the last two decades, the cable bolt technology has improved significantly and new types of cable bolts, new grouts and new installation methods and pumps have been introduced and successfully developed. The design of cable bolts is currently attempted by empirical methods based on rockmass characterization. However, until such methods do not take into account all the important parameters affecting the mechanical behaviour of cable bolts namely, the type of cable geometry, grout quality, stiffness of the host medium, the amount of confining pressure and the presence of end anchorage and pretension. This thesis deals with the numerical modelling of cable bolts considering all of the above mentioned factors. To evaluate the shear bond stiffness of cable bolts, which simulate the interface between the cable bolt and the rockmass, a new empirical model is developed. A database with data of pull-out tests is constructed. Empirical relations were derived between the shear bond stiffness and the variation of confining pressure, the modulus of elasticity of host medium and the water:cement ratio. The relations were derived for three types of cables (standard cable, nutcase cable and garford bulb cable). A new numerical model using the finite element method is developed for the numerical simulation of cable bolts. Together with the empirical model for shear bond stiffness, the numerical model computes the load distribution along the cable bolt and thus can simulate fully grouted, partially grouted, end anchored and tensioned cable bolts. The model is implemented in an existing finite element code (e-z tools). Parametric analyses are performed on the new model, and proved useful in the demonstration of the role of each design parameter. A new design methodology is proposed to evaluate the load distribution along the cable bolt. Two case studies are presented: a stope hanging-wall support by cable bolt in a hardrock mine and a tailgate secondary supports in a coal mine. A comparison with measurements in the field shows good agreement with computed forces.</description><creator>Bouteldja, Malek.</creator><contributor>Mitri, Hani S.

Ion transport and electron transfer at SAM/electrolyte interfaces are two important processes which have been characterized by cyclic voltammetry and a.c. impedance spectroscopy. Ion transport from an aqueous phase to the hydrophobic SAM region has been addressed by investigating the insulating properties of a wide variety of X(CH2)nS/Au SAMs (X = CH3, OH, CO2H and CF 3, and n = 7, 9, 11, 15). It was established that when the phase angle at a frequency characteristic of ion diffusion processes ( i.e. 1 Hz) is &gt;88°, the SAM is defect-free and obeys the Helmholtz ideal capacitor model. However, when φ1HZ &lt; 88°, the SAM is no longer an ionic insulator and ion/water penetration from the electrolyte into the SAM hydrophobic region is observed. The behavior of the phase angle with frequency was used to characterize the permeability of SAMs to electrolyte ions (K+, H2PO4 -, and HPO42-) as a function of the applied d.c. potential. A critical potential, Vc, was identified for each type of SAM corresponding to a transition from an insulating state to a more permeable state. When X = CH3, V c becomes more cathodic with increasing chainlength, i.e. Vc = -0.15 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) for n = 7, -0.25 V for n = 9, 11, and -0.35 V for n = 15. The SAM ionic permeability can also be modulated by maintaining n constant (15) and by varying the terminal group X. Vc is considerably more anodic for hydrophilic SAM/electrolyte interfaces (+0.25 V vs . Ag/AgCl for X = OH and + 0.15 V for X = CO2H) than for hydrophobic interfaces (-0.35 V for X = CH3). The kinetics of electron transfer at CH3(CH2)15CH3 SAMs have been investigated by a.c. impedance spectroscopy at various d.c. overpotentials with three redox couples, Ru(NH3)63+/2+, Fe(CN)63-/4-, and Co(b</description><creator>Boubour, Emmanuelle.</creator><contributor>Lennox, R.

Beginning with the notion that political institutions make a difference in how politics is conducted, the thesis argues that "second tier" stakeholdership institutions---that is, institutions beyond voting and political party rules, such as public hearings, the formal inclusion of encompassing organizations in government decision-making, or public interest law---are extremely important in the deepening of democracy and the attainment of high-quality democracy. The thesis then uses stakeholdership as a foundation to build four models of democracy (hyper-presidential, "cupular", neo-corporatist, and pluralist) each of which vary in terms of stakeholdership and, therefore, in terms of democratic quality. After exploring these themes in the first three chapters, the thesis examines the case of post-authoritarian Chile. By looking at tax reform and judicial reform in Chile since 1990, the thesis analyses political bargaining, modes of inclusion and political institutions to determine the quality of Chilean democracy. The thesis concludes that of the four models articulated earlier, "cupular" democracy best captures the reality of Chile since 1990. Since cupular democracy has very low levels of stakeholdership, the thesis suggests that this is worrisome and makes some tentative recommendations for democratizers, both in Chile and in other relevant contexts.</description><creator>Bickford, Louis N.</creator><contributor>Oxhorn, Philip (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Democratization.</subject><subject>Chile -- Politics and government -- 1988-</subject><subject>Democracy.</subject><subject>Democracy -- Chile.</subject><subject>Political participation.</subject><subject>Political participation -- Chile.</subject><title>Strengthening democracy : stakeholder institutions, public policy and democratic quality, the case of Chile, 1990-1998</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/cf95jd01d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4x51hk86b</identifier><degree><name>Doctor of Philosophy</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Political Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5x21th14z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:44:22Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of is dissertation is to bring together theories of gender, religion and the mass media in an analysis of the representation of American Catholic women religious in popular culture from 1950 till 1971. In so doing, I argue for the development of research frameworks in feminist cultural studies which acknowledge those women who sought alternatives to dominant positions of marriage and motherhood, but who did not reject outright traditional notions of femininity. Furthermore, I suggest that claims to religious virtuosity have been a source of moral and political authority for women in the past. Through such claims, women have gained greater access to educational and professional opportunities during eras of incipient feminism. I link the reform efforts of sisters in the fifties and sixties to two concurrent movements: the rise of the second wave of feminism, and the modernization of the American Catholic church according to the initiatives set forth by the Second Vatican Council (1962--1965). Together, these three areas provide a context for the analysis of the meanings and values mediated by the representation of nuns in films, television, popular literature and music. The wide-spread interest in the religious life for women by all areas of the mass media occurred at a time when American society was undergoing massive shifts not only in gender relations but also in terms of how religion was valorized. Images of nuns seemed to help audiences negotiate the changes in the discourses surrounding gender, religious and national identity. At the same time, American sisters were struggling with their own sense of identity as women and as members of the Catholic church. This conflict between images and identity for women religious highlights a number of issues within feminist cultural studies. Not the least of which is articulating the relationship between history, agency and ideology in theories of women's cultural representation in ways which can take into ac</description><creator>Sullivan, Rebecca.</creator><contributor>Robinson, Gertrude J.
