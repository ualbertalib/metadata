Results have been disappointing, and developing countries, particularly in the Latin American-Caribbean (LAC) region, are now also pursuing economic integration at the regional level. The 1990s have in fact been characterised by the general revival of regionalism, a trend considered by many legal scholars and economists as dangerous for multilateralism. The debate is ongoing, and the WTO is currently attempting to better monitor the impacts of regionalism. In any case, regional integration agreements (RIAs) are now present in all parts of the world, and developing countries seem to consider that such arrangements offer promising opportunities than lack in multilateral agreements. More particularly, LAC countries are now pursuing economic integration at the bilateral, subregional, regional and even hemispheric level with the current negotiations for a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). But the creation of a FTAA faces many obstacles, caused by wide disparities in the level of economic development within the region and the incredible variety of existing RIAs throughout the Hemisphere. And it remains to be seen if equity and social concerns will be better reflected in a regional agreement than at the multilateral level.</description><creator>Bourély, Nadia.</creator><contributor>De Mestral, Armand (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Latin America -- Economic integration.</subject><subject>Caribbean Area -- Economic integration.</subject><subject>Free trade -- America.</subject><subject>Developing countries -- Economic integration.</subject><title>Economic integration of developing countries and regionalism in Latin America and the Caribbean : prospects for a free trade area of the Americas</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dv13zw33d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/xs55md697</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:tt44pp92r</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:56:11Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The opening of telecommunications to competition since the beginning of the 1980's has several explanations. Governments have acknowledged that the regulatory preservation of national monopolies had become impossible as well as economically inefficient, notably because of certain technological revolutions. Liberalization of telecommunications must also be seen in the context of a global opening of markets, of which the most obvious manifestation is the creation of the WTO. At the European level, liberalization is the logical consequence of the Treaty of Rome principles and objectives. Introducing competition to the telecommunication sector proves to be extremely difficult in practice, especially in a context where telecommunication, media an information technologies industries converge. The new regulation must find, through the definition of interconnection conditions between operators and the preservation of universal service, an equilibrium between the conflicting interests of incumbent and new operators, and those of professional and residential customers.</description><creator>Boissel Dombreval, Hugues.</creator><contributor>Janda, Richard (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Telecommunication -- Law and legislation -- European Union countries.</subject><title>La libéralisation des télécommunications dans l'union européenne /</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/b5644t44k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tt44pp92r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:3f4627311</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:56:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Patients who refuse a specific medical treatment for religious reasons must often overcome strongly entrenched presumptions held by physicians and judges, presumptions frequently based on personal values. A case in point is the refusal of blood transfusion therapy by Jehovah's Witnesses. This paper rests on the following theory: The sanctity of life principle is not necessarily violated by respecting the autonomous decision of a patient who, for religious or moral reasons, chooses one therapy over another that may be favored by the treating physician. Where a patient has decided for conscientious reasons against a certain treatment in any given medical situation, the need to be informed will shift from the patient to the physician. The physician must understand the nature of the religious or moral conviction, as well as his own moral and legal obligation to respect the patient's wishes by providing the best medical care under the circumstances.</description><creator>Carbonneau, André, 1952-</creator><contributor>Keyserlingk, Edward (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Sklar, Ronald (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Medicine -- Religious aspects.</subject><subject>Blood -- Religious aspects.</subject><subject>Jehovah's Witnesses.</subject><subject>Medical ethics.</subject><subject>Medicine -- Religious aspects -- Christianity.</subject><title>Conscientious objectors to a medical treatment - what are the rules?</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5m60qt93m.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3f4627311</identifier><degree><name>Master of Laws</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Comparative Law</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:br86b5229</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:56:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This study analyses Intellectual Property Rights related to space activities and Space Law. The potential contradictions between these two laws are of specific interest. Besides the different approaches on which their legislation has been established, the increasing role of private companies as space actors calls for the adoption of a strong legal framework for Intellectual Property. The issue of Intellectual Property Rights in outer space will be examined within the first Part, with a focus on Patent Law. The second Part explores the specific rules contained in the International Space Station Intergovernmental Agreement, on Intellectual Property and exchange of data and goods.

Although incineration is seen as the most effective solution, this unfortunately leaves large quantities of residues such as fly ash and bottom ash. The ashes are alumino-silicate materials, which are excellent candidates for producing both glasses and glass ceramic materials. In the present work, samples of pulp and paper incinerator residues were collected and the initial characteristics (moisture content, loss on ignition, particle size and size distribution, chemical composition) were analyzed. The major oxides were found to fall within the SiO2-Al2O 3-CaO (CAS) system. Moreover, nucleating agents such as TiO2, Fe2O3, Cr2O3 and P2O 5 were also present in the glass. Through thermal analysis (TGA and DTA) optimum heating schedules were selected for producing glass ceramic materials. It was found that the optimum devitrification temperature for fly ash was 1200°C and the final product contained anorthite with/without albite. Hardness values exceeded that of the parent glass and thus the material should be useful in glass ceramic applications.</description><creator>Sivasundaram, Mathumathi.</creator><contributor>Caley, W.

Along with deeper mining comes its associated challenges: increased stresses and seismicity, increased heat load and increased inefficiencies due to hoisting constraints and travel time. All of these challenges, and more, contribute to safety concerns, higher initial capital costs and higher operating costs, which combined, can make deep reserves uneconomic. In order to meet these challenges, we must closely examine present deep mining infrastructures and operating practices with a view to learn and enhance upon "Best Practices". This thesis will examine the challenges of providing ventilation within deep, hot mines. Specifically, we will examine Inco Limited's Creighton Mine. A current expansion at Creighton will see mining progress to the 7660 level within the next few years. A key issue, which arises, is the question as to whether Creighton will need a refrigeration system or can it continue to rely on its natural heat exchange capacity.</description><creator>Sylvestre, Michel J.-G.</creator><contributor>Hassani, Ferri (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><subject>Engineering, Mining.</subject><title>Heating and ventilation study of Inco's Creighton Mine</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/4x51hm09f.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cn69m588t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mw22v7425</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:56:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The essence of this work consists of developing a robust algorithm for the estimation of Lyapunov exponents and complex exponents from an observed time series. These characteristic exponents are representative of a nonlinear system's behaviour, and enable flight flutter data analysis to be performed, the methodology developed was found to be inadequate for short and noisy data sets. Attention is therefore focused on two methods to alleviate this deficiency, one to reduce the noise that contaminates the time series, and another to concatenate several short experimental data sets. The properties of the different methodologies are assessed on simulated data, and accurate system parameter identification is obtained. An analysis on real flight test data is then performed with the aim of obtaining modal damping and frequency for the CF-18 aircraft in flight conditions. All the numerical results are discussed, and the effects of noise and the length of data are investigated.</description><creator>Seyvet, Fabien.</creator><contributor>Price, S. J.

Computer simulations are a cost-effective method to obtain optimal heat transfer designs of internally finned pipes. In this work, a control-volume finite element method was formulated, coded, and used for computer simulations of fully-developed, laminar, fluid flow and heat transfer in pipes with internal twisted fins of triangular cross-section. Values of Nusselt number and friction factor were computed for a relevant range of twist ratio, fin length, fin thickness, and Reynolds number, for a Prandtl number of 0.7. Some optimal configurations were identified. An overview of this work and the results will be presented in this thesis.</description><creator>Tanguay, Michel.</creator><contributor>Baliba, B. R.

One of these models is based on the well-known "Hele-Shaw" approximation which, is commonly used by a considerable number of commercial packages. This method utilizes the fact that generally the flow is confined in a narrow gap in which out-of-plane flows may be ignored and, therefore, only a two-dimensional (2-D) solution of the flow field is necessary. One remarkable limitation of this approach is its impossibility of predicting the so-called "fountain flow". Furthermore, this model neglects the role of crystallization kinetics. On the other hand, the other model proposes a methodology that deals with fountain flow and crystallization. It is based on the so-called "2&amp;frac12;-D" numerical simulation since it combines a 2-D flow analysis with a 3-D solution of the energy equation. First, a two-dimensional analysis in the gap-wise direction is performed in order to obtain fountain flow information. Then, in-plane two-dimensional flow solutions are coupled with three-dimensional energy results, which incorporate the heat generated by crystallization. Two different thermoplastics were investigated. Polyethylene was selected to characterize the crystalline behavior. Polystyrene was chosen as the amorphous material. In order to obtain insight of the overall injection molding cycle, pressure evolution in the cavity and in the nozzle was examined carefully. More accurate pressure results were computed when using the 2&amp;frac12;-D model. This study thus puts in evidence the importance of including fountain flow and crystallization kinetics in the injection molding process.</description><creator>Hernández Aguilar, José Ramón.</creator><contributor>Kamal, Musa R.

The methodology is applied to evaluate the structural reliability of bridge steel members subject to compression, tension, shear and bending. The steel truss members, floor beam and stringer of a typical span located on the Jacques-Cartier Bridge in Montreal are evaluated using this methodology. Data for the evaluation was obtained from a comprehensive inspection and sampling program on the bridge involving tests on 74 steel coupons. The results of the evaluation are then compared to the results of the evaluation using the load and resistance factors method and the mean load method outlined in the draft version of the CHBDC, 1998, (Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code). In this application, the advanced reliability analysis indicates that the estimation of the reliability of bridge members, in their current condition, using the loads and resistance factors method specified in the code may be too conservative. This situation was encountered in the case of the floor beams of the analysed span, when the failure mode considered was shear. The advanced reliability analysis indicates also in this application, that the evaluation of the reliability of bridge members, using the mean load method specified in the code may not be conservative. This situation was encountered in the case of the truss members of the analysed span, when the failure mode considered was compression. The evaluation of bridge structures using advanced structural reliability methods can be used to obtain more accurate estimates of their reliability. This information can be used to develop better, monitoring, inspection, maintenance, and rehabilitation strategies for bridge members.</description><creator>Hindié, Fares.</creator><contributor>Chouinard, Luc (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Engineering, Civil.</subject><title>Evaluation of existing bridges using advanced reliability methods</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/fq977w91t.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pv63g204c</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:st74cs346</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:56:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Solubilization of naphthalene and phenanthrene from a synthesized multi-component non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPL) by aqueous in polyethoxylated surfactant solutions at supra-CMC dosages was evaluated in this study. PAHs are abundant at sites contaminated with many chemically complex NAPLs, such as coal tars, creosotes, and petroleum distillates. Surfactant flushing has been proposed to speed remediation at many contaminated sites, due to surfactant's ability to solubilize these hydrophobic compounds. While it is well known that surfactant micelles can solubilize significant amounts of PAHs, this research demonstrates for the first time the relationship between NAPL PAH mole fraction and the solubilization capacity of surfactant solutions. Henry's law satisfactorily described the partitioning of PAHs from hexadecane into water and into surfactant solutions. Selective solubilization of naphthalene over phenanthrene was observed, which is believed to be the result of competition for space in the micelle's outer layers. From these results a predictive relationship between NAPL PAH mole fractions and micellar solubilization is presented.</description><creator>Hill, Alex J.</creator><contributor>Ghoshal, Sabhasis (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Engineering, Civil.</subject><subject>Engineering, Environmental.</subject><title>Surfactant solubilization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from nonaqueous phase liquids</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jh343t946.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/st74cs346</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:tx31qk68x</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:56:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The Ambulatory Robotics Laboratory (ARL) has been pursuing an agenda of developing low cost, simple legged robots, with the hopes of increasing the usefulness of legged robots by reducing their price and increasing their reliability. Currently, ARL is developing the Scout class of robots. These are electrically powered quadruped robots with only one actuated degree of freedom per leg. Previous work with these robots developed bounding gaits, in which the front and back legs operate together as pairs. The topic of this research is to design and implement trotting gaits by using a passive knee. A passive knee has no motor, but relies on natural dynamics and the dynamic coupling with the upper leg for knee angle control. A trot is a walking gait in which the diagonal legs operate together as pairs. In this research, a new passive knee is designed and built. It is interfaced with Scout II, the larger of the two Scout robots at ARL. Models of it are developed and simulations are performed to develop and verify walking controllers. Experiments are performed and two types of trotting gaits are successfully achieved.</description><creator>Hawker, Geoff, 1972-</creator><contributor>Buehler, Martin (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>Quadruped trotting with passive knees - design, control, and experiments</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/9880vs80p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/tx31qk68x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:j6731582s</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:56:15Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The purpose of this thesis will be to substantiate the claim that Roald Dahl, the author of humorous writings for children, is simultaneously an avid creator of grotesque fiction. My argument is based on the premise that unless one views Dahl's texts in terms of their grotesque influence, critical evaluation of his work inevitably becomes reduced to a question of taste. A diachronic overview of the term "grotesque" is presented beginning with its delineation of an artistic mode in early Rome to its Rabelaisian extensions during the sixteenth century. The origins of the word are established, and its changing meaning throughout history is examined. A synchronic approach to the study follows, tracing both modern and post-modern theories of the grotesque. Of particular importance to the survey is Bakhtin's Rabelais and His World. By emphasizing the "positive, regenerating, creative" powers of laughter, Rabelais comes closest to defining the comic grotesque as embodied in Dahl's fiction. The final portion of the thesis is devoted to an interpretation of such texts as The Twits, George's Marvelous Medicine, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Dahl's treatment of character, his development of plot, and his use of language are discussed in relation to previous theories of the grotesque. A psychological defense of the genre is offered as a conclusion to the study.

But figuratively, literally and properly, what can be said about Alexandre's body? The aim of this study is to answer this question in two parts. First, by focussing on the cashier's body illnesses, we establish that his physical suffering is the metaphor of the psychological harm which affects him too, the prostate cancer illustrating his difficulty with oral and written communication. Then, through a semiotic reading of the body seen as a vector of communicative signs, we define the protagonist's behavioural attitude in relationship to other characters in the novel, we isolate the conditions behind the existence of various behaviours and, concurrently, we establish the poetics of the non-verbal. Our analysis reveals that the hero is able to use body language to his advantage, that the narrator shows him under his best light in this regard and that it is by this way, the non-verbal, that Alexandre succeeds in transmitting a message. If spoken words still conceal secrets for the cashier, body language has none. In fact, the character's alienation is confirmed but, for Alexandre, body language is a way to escape it.</description><creator>Tanguay, Céline.</creator><contributor>Ricard, Francois (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Roy, Gabrielle, 1909-</subject><title>Maux et mots du corps dans Alexandre Chenevert de Gabrielle Roy</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8623j077p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/8w32r7457</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:tx31qk696</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:56:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Women's role in contemporary Iranian economy has either been ignored or portrayed as suppressed by the state's so-called "Islamic" ideologies and policies. This thesis argues that while the post-revolutionary state's Islamization attempted to create a particular gender system that excludes women from the labour market, it has proved to be unsuccessful. This imposed gender system has failed to achieve its goals due to both unstable economic conditions and through the active role women have played in opposing this set of ideologies. Concurrently, Iranian women have confirmed themselves as income-earning and economically productive individuals, contributing to the social and economic well being of their families as well as their country. The field study herein focuses on a sample of these economically active women, including both formally employed women and women who have set up (informal) businesses at home. It is argued that both groups of women contribute significant monetary income to the household and consequently to the economic and social development of their nation. In doing so they also challenge state ideologies and policies that restrict their economic and social role.</description><creator>Tehrani-Ami, Behnaz.</creator><contributor>Bossen, L.

Pushkin, Russia's national poet and its most revered author, is little known in France, where his works are often considered untranslatable. The reasons for this phenomenon lie in the first non-translational transfers of Pushkin, followed by the first attempts of translational transfers that came only to raise the existing stereotypes into dogmas, which were reinforced by the theoretical thoughts on the art of translation developed by the translating subjects of the time. The present study analyses the influence of the para-text and of empiricism on the transfer, reception and perception of Pushkin and his works, as they evolved in the course of nineteenth century France.</description><creator>Teplova, Natalia.</creator><contributor>Chapdelaine, Annick (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Pushkin, Aleksandr Sergeevich, 1799-1837 -- Translations -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><title>Pouchkine en France au XIXe siècle : problèmes de translation</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8s45qb72w.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/k643b305j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:7d278w12s</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:56:17Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>This thesis explores the development of women's education in pre-independence Egypt from the mid-nineteenth century to 1922. It looks at women's educational facilities and women's access to education through the reigns of Muhammad Ali, Said, Ismail and the British occupation. While the rise in women's educational concerns on a formal level parallels the growth of modernist, Islamic reformist, and proto-feminist thought in the late nineteenth century, the relationship among the three groups vis a vis their respective positions on women's education differs and is therefore examined in the thesis. Research on this topic reveals a correlation between the early women's movement, a strong proponent of women's education, and Egypt's national and Islamic reform movements. As each group espoused a vision of change for Egypt, one secular and the other decidedly more religious, the common denominator for social progress was the unanimous support for advancements, although conditional, in educational policies regarding women. Couched in a context of modernism, the pursuit of freedom from foreign control and the desire for Egypt to develop into a fully productive society, were indispensable aspects of the development of women's education.</description><creator>Piquado, Laura.</creator><contributor>Turgay, A.

It explores how sports participation benefits academic undertakings and vice versa. More specifically, it was hypothesized that participation in sports helps to foster abilities that influence students during their academic careers. Subjects were in their second year of the International Baccalaureate program at a Montreal College, which consists of two intensive preparatory years prior to University. Motivation and self-perception were assessed using translated versions of Harter's (1980, 1988) instruments. An interview inspired by Taylor and Schneider (1992) was used to collect students' perceptions of sports and academic topics. Students who were training in competitive sports were asked to participate in follow-up interviews. Although no significant results were found, the interviews provide many insights regarding engagement in an activity, Harter's scales.</description><creator>Primeau, Rachel.</creator><contributor>Delcourt, M.

Though Woolf is recognized as a revolutionary contributor to the development of modernism, it is also important to remember that she was born in 1882 and that the nineteenth century also left its mark on her. The first chapter will examine this double sensibility. The second chapter will trace the development of Woolf's modernist aesthetic. She was obviously rebelling against the realism valued by her Victorian and Edwardian predecessors when she conceived of a literary style capable of abstracting from purely formal elements a more "profound reality" than that captured by objective and representational descriptions. Despite this revolutionary tendency, she constructs a hierarchy of "realities" that is somewhat elitist in its mysticism and runs counter to the revolutionary feminist and Marxist thought evident in so much of her work. The last chapter will examine the contradictions that riddle Woolf's feminist writings.</description><creator>Polychronakos, Helen.</creator><contributor>O'Toole, Tess (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Woolf, Virginia, 1882-1941 -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><subject>Feminism in literature.</subject><title>Reflecting Woolf : Virginia Woolf's feminist politics and modernist aesthetics</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/12579v14q.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6m311r26r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1831cm80k</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:56:18Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The primary purpose of this study is to determine if three coping strategies (exercise, hobbies, and social support) were related to some or all of the three dimensions of burnout (Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalization, and Personal Accomplishment).

The author collected previously unrecorded toponyms from the territory of this Caribou Inuit society, the Harvaqtuuq [Kazan River], and corroborated the data of earlier researchers. The Harvaqtuuq landscape was organized from foci of subsistence activities by application of Inuktitut geographical terminology and concepts. These foci moved over time and betray changing land-use patterns. The Harvaqtuuq was a frontier for Inuit, due to the need to depend on caribou, and due to the conflict engendered by overlapping Dene occupation. The presence of anthroponyms, and the paucity of pan-Inuit myths in the landscape allow for the speculative interpretation that the names support current theories of a recent arrival of Inuit to the Harvaqtuuq .</description><creator>Keith, Darren E.

The following part is an essay on memories and filiation in Le temps qui m'a manque, by Gabrielle Roy. Four reminiscences will be scrutinized: her mother's house, the satin collar, the medals and the seagulls. The first one is about continuity and identification (the mother's house); the second and the third ones, the satin collar masking the unfinished hem, the medals relating to owing, illustrate a filiation based on want. Lastly, the memory of the seagulls synthesizes the light and the dark sides of the mother-daughter filiation, the daughter leaving her mother (rupture) to fulfill her mother's as well as her own dream of freedom (continuity).</description><creator>Houde-Sauvé, Renée.</creator><contributor>Rivard, Yvon (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Roy, Gabrielle, 1909- Temps qui m'a manqué.</subject><subject>Memory in literature.</subject><subject>Family in literature.</subject><title>Femme de Crète, et, Souvenirs et filiation dans Le temps-- de G.

Aesthetics is seen by many educators as a frivolous experience---at best a weak substitute for serious learning. This is the issue that Dewey addressed in his philosophy of aesthetics, and this is also where my focus lies in this thesis. The thesis is a personal and theoretical examination of John Dewey's aesthetic philosophy as it is principally expressed in Art as Experience . In exploring the personal implications of the aesthetic experience, the thesis investigates Dewey's argument that the aesthetic is an intrinsic part of life. It demonstrates Dewey's emphasis on the productive presence of the aesthetic in the cultural life of society.</description><creator>Jakubowicz, Rosa.</creator><contributor>Wood, Elizabeth (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1999</date><subject>Dewey, John, 1859-1952.

Yet, this rather limited approach to aesthetics overlooks all work that does not belong to either of these two categories. More precisely, most contemporary debate fails to consider the important category of ambivalence. What might it mean to both love and hate a given work of art? The following essay examines the complex emotion of ambivalence as a category of aesthetic experience. Drawing upon the work of British filmmaker Peter Greenaway, it will be argued that ambivalence encourages a new, dynamic approach to the work of art. Ultimately, this new approach will be looked to as a possible means of challenging the hegemony of the Modernist/Postmodernist divide.</description><creator>Jenkins, Brad.</creator><contributor>Cope, Karin (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Greenaway, Peter -- Criticism and interpretation.</subject><title>The tickled underbelly : Peter Greenaway and the aesthetics of ambivalence</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/7m01bn628.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0g354h186</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of English</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:k930c011x</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T20:56:20Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Le present essai propose en premier lieu une analyse de la theorie linguistique de Walter Benjamin telle qu'enoncee dans son essai de 1916, Uber Sprache uberhaupt und uber die Sprache des Menschen.
