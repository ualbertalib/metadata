It was heightened by the lost war against Japan in 1904-1905 and the violent social disturbances of 1904-1907. It was also a period of great social, political and ideological upheaval. Efforts were made to save and preserve the economical, social and political system, to reform it, to change it profoundly as well as to overthrow it through revolution. Those years can be described as a turning point in Russia's history, an era of struggle about the future direction of Russian society. One of the attempted solutions to the most important Russian problems of that time was the set of measures and reforms proposed in 1906-1911 during the prime-ministership of Peter Arkad'evich Stolypin. His policies and his efforts to implement them have been the subject of heated discussion and controversy among politicians, political thinkers and historians, as well as among those they affected. This thesis is devoted to an examination of Stolypin's reforms and their effect on the economic, social and political development of the Russian Empire. Their relevance today is suggested by the renewed attempts of the successor states of the Soviet Union to privatize land ownership and at last solve the agrarian problems which Stolypin's assassination and the coming of the First World War cut short. It is this that makes a fresh appraisal of Stolypin timely.</description><creator>Radzioch, Witold Christopher</creator><contributor>Boss, V. J.

In some primary tumors and established cell lines, stable mutant p53 protein is expressed at high levels, whereas, in normal cells unstable wild-type p53 protein is expressed at very low levels. Sera from some patients with breast and colon tumors contain anti-p53 antibodies. It is unclear whether changes in p53 structure, or its increased level in tumors, causes p53 to become antigenic. In our study we tested sera from patients with various types of cancer for anti-p53 antibodies. Examination of the sera was made by Western blot, and the results were confirmed by rescreening sera with immunoprecipitation. Both techniques revealed the presence of anti-p53 antibodies in some sera from lung and ovary cancer patients, as well as in the sera from patients with breast or colon cancers. Clearly, patients with various cancer tumors are able to produce anti-p53 antibodies. It was unclear whether this humoral immune response is against mutant or wild type p53. To provide a better definition of this immune response, we have examined the anti-p53 response from cancer patients against mutant and wild type p53 in the native and denaturated state. Western blot and Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the anti-p53 sera recognise both wild type and mutant p53 conformational and denaturation resistant epitopes. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the mutant p53 is not more antigenic than the wild type p53. This provides strong evidence that the antibody response is not directed solely against the altered conformation in mutant p53.</description><creator>Naor, Naftaly</creator><date>1993</date><subject>Immune response.</subject><subject>Cancer -- Genetic aspects.</subject><subject>Phosphoproteins.</subject><title>The immune response against p53 protein in cancer patients /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rj4305584.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m900nv40n</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Institute of Parasitology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:th83m0252</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:57:12Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>According to the structuralist Claude Levi-Strauss, all myth has but one same structure. The purpose of this study is to expose the mythico-initiatory edifice that informs Vendredi ou les limbes du Pacifique, Le Roi des Aulnes, as well as Les Meteores, Michel Tournier's "trilogy". To write, according to Tournier, cannot be a matter of literary creation, but simply of literary renewal. Vendredi ou les limbes du Pacifique, Le Roi des Aulnes and Les Meteores represent literary reflections on the primordial importance of Myth, for the Artist and above all, for Man; it is this mythic dimension that makes Tournier's entire oeuvre an "autobiography", or rather an autohagiography, according to Tournier's neologism. The three protagonists, Robinson, Tiffauges and Paul Surin, literary avatars of Tournier as Author, embark on a Quest for this lost mythic Unity; we will see that the voyage each makes is but one and the same, an allegorical odyssey toward the light$ ...$ of the City of the Sun.</description><creator>Nicholson, Karen</creator><contributor>Desrosiers-Bonin, Diane (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Tournier, Michel -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><title>Des structures mytho-initiatiques chez Michel Tournier</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5h73pw889.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/th83m0252</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5m60qs89t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:57:13Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Nowadays, the discourse tn Maeterlinck's dramas seems to be a web of faults concerning the story levels as well as the meanings. L'Organisation du recit dans Pelleas et Melisande de Maeterlinck analyses the text regarding these aspects which confer to the play a dreamlike character. The dream atmosphere is mainly suggested by a narrative background interfering into the plot: the symbolic message. Our survey of the play tends to examine the paradoxal and incomplete nature of the events in their accounts. The reports also contain potential new facts and stories' material to be developped. It is the laborious introduction, the many repetitions and the unanswered questions that involve the play into the quest of a story. This process puts the reader into the experience of the theatre de l'attente. Consequently we suggest the following hypothesis: the audience, or the reader, does not assist to what the play seems to show, but to the symbolization of the characters' subconscious created by the story levels and intertextuality. The traditional scene is relegated far beyond the reality and the reflexive conclusion of the play reiterates the initial scene. We think that the rehabilitation of the Ancestral Order creates a new potential narrative background--a story to come--since the play showed many motives borrowed to prior legends, the Bible, and other dramas. The symbolic complexity muddle up the play and converge mainly to draw a late feodal submission to fate.</description><creator>Bénard, Alain</creator><contributor>Morisot, Jean-Claude (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Maeterlinck, Maurice, 1862-1949.

It attempts to describe the particular relationship between Islam and the development of the Indonesian nation. It examines the role of Islam in promoting the process of nation formation in Indonesia until the early 1930's. Since the coming of Islam to the Archipelago, the 'ulama' and their writings played a central role in the integration of the Malay world. The use of the Malay language as a lingua franca accelerated the process of integration as well as the process of mutual understanding among the people, the majority of whom were Muslim. When European colonialism appeared on the scene, the Muslims resisted it labelling the foreigners as non-Muslims. Opposition came from the royal, the aristocratic and the 'ulama' sectors. All in their way demonstrated resistance to every aspect of imperialism and colonialism. At the beginning of the 20th century, Muslims began to turn to socio-religious organizations in their efforts to achieve independence. This was a period of significant Muslim contributions to Indonesian nationalism. Some favored a structural approach while others pursued a cultural means. Indeed, people began to think in more democratic terms, and began to realize their inferior position within the colonial system. The response of the colonial government helped, in spite of itself, to foster national unity. The significance of this thesis lies in the fact that there has not yet been any attempt to trace the background of the formation of the Indonesian state with particular reference to the role of Islam.</description><creator>Bakti, Andi Faisal</creator><contributor>Turgay, A.

Between 1973 and 1988, 11 376 single family dwellings were built in the 'West Island'. A geographic information system (GIS) analysis shows 40 percent of vacant land was developed between 1983 and 1989, over half this was for low density housing. A study of citizens' perceptions of the changes shows 72 percent of residents felt local environmental conditions were the same or better than when they first moved to the area (average 14 years) and 71 percent felt the quality of the community was the same or better. The condition of wooded areas was the largest determinant of perception of local environmental conditions and "friendliness" was most closely related to evaluations of community quality. A history of environmental activism describes a sector of the population as having crossed a "threshold of tolerance" and taken action to protect valued natural assets of the community.</description><creator>Adams, Jennifer</creator><contributor>Meredith, T.

The goal of this thesis is to examine a sample of the Jewish responses to this biblical narrative from ancient and medieval times through the twentieth century.

In effect to understand modernity on its own terms one would have to inquire if we have any more right to affirm a given future than to deny one? The question arises as follows. If a subject exists prior to the process which is its being, an uncomfortable aporia ensues. Firstly, if being human is understood as "becoming", i.e. humans can and do appear through the enactment of change, then "being" itself is temporal. How then does this self secure its appearance other than through the very process it assumes itself to be prior to? Such a securing would imply an absolute uniformity and homogeneity not predicated on human-enacted change. If securing is in fact the aim of appearance, and therefore the operative term in judgement, what then are the consequences of action in terms of created results? In other words, what are the consequences of the temporality of "being"? It continues to produce a world. The second question then is: how does one judge, make and act, toward a future which properly speaking, cannot be our rightful concern? The question is approached initially through a discussion of the integral terms. In the final chapters, an attempt is made to understand the premise of Marcel Duchamp's Etant Donnes. Duchamp's work is taken as paradigmatic of making circumventing the aporia of self-revelation through becoming.</description><creator>Berns, Torben</creator><contributor>Perez-Gomez, A.

Very high levels of contamination from the surface of the initial sections required that plants be grown under greenhouse conditions. Rose plantlets obtained from subsequent subcultures were used for the first time in a radiotracer experiment with $ sp{32}$P to study the kinetics of phosphorus (P) uptake as a function of temperature of the nutrient medium. P uptake increased with time for rooted and non-rooted plantlets in a linear fashion that did not reach an equilibrium value even after 96 hours of exposure. An analysis of variance revealed that the plantlets with roots absorbed significantly greater amounts of P at the 0.01 level compared with non-rooted plantlets at 22$ sp circ$C. P uptake was significantly higher at the 0.05 level, for rooted versus non-rooted plantlets at 33$ sp circ$C. There was no significant difference in P uptake by rooted and non-rooted plantlets at 3$ sp circ$C. Interaction between time of exposures and rooting was found to be significant at 22$ sp circ$C and 33$ sp circ$C at the 0.01 level. The results indicated that the root system, previously thought to be inefficient in the nutrient absorption, played a key role in absorbing P from the nutrient medium at optimum temperature.</description><creator>Abdulnour, Jihad</creator><contributor>Barthakur, N.

The adaptive phase-locked loop (PLL) that will be described has not previously been used in the application of video synchronization. We shall demonstrate that this type of PLL will be able to out perform a static PLL in terms of its acquisition time, while still achieving a comparable noise performance. The PLL we shall describe will also be designed to be integrated on a single sub-micron BiCMOS chip. It is desired to place on this same chip a video-speed filter, and an analog to digital converter. For this reason we shall also provide some data to better evaluate the feasibility of designing a single chip that will perform these three functions.</description><creator>Bishop, Andrew J.</creator><contributor>Blostein, M.

The results of the study indicated that the majority of school boards do not have written selection policies and procedures to guide the selection of elementary school principals. In addition, the majority of school boards do not have written job descriptions, written selection criteria or written selection techniques. Although there was an absence of written job descriptions, respondents considered educational leadership as the main expectation for elementary school principals. In the absence of written selection criteria, it was noted that respondents had criteria that they felt were important for the elementary school principalship. The three most important personal selection criteria were decision-making skills, human relations skills and communication skills. The results of this study indicated that the director-general and the director of human resources were the main participants in the selection committee.

Through international media attention, pragmatics, and rhetorical analysis, I shall interpret a speech which has brought both national and international condemnation as well as point out pragmato-rhetorical errors, both of which forced Mr. Jenninger's resignation. The first chapter is a stenographic copy of the speech, supplied by the West German Parlamentary Archives. The second chapter divides international media reports into sub-headings, which distinctly exemplify the importance of a strong knowledge of pragmatism and rhetoric in speech writing through their analysis of the Jenninger speech. The third chapter is a discourse on speech act theory with a practical political application. The fourth chapter analyses speech excerpts and concludes with a discussion of the pragmato-rhetorical concept of the target audience and its bearing on speech content.</description><creator>Barnes, Colin Dean</creator><date>1993</date><subject>Jenninger, Philipp</subject><subject>Kristallnacht, 1938</subject><title>Textpragmatik der Holocaust-Rede von Philipp Jenninger</title><language>ger</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/n296wz86d.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m326m257h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of German</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:tm70mw033</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T02:57:16Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Blake's writings were explored as a refutation of Newton and Locke, and thereby positivism and atomistic psychology, leading to a renovation of the sensual body and the imagination.

Adventitious shoot regeneration from leaf discs was improved using explants 10 mm in diameter and transferring to fresh medium at the fourth week of incubation. Additions of liquid medium to solid medium during incubation decreased regeneration and attempts to release the suppressive influence of larger shoots on initials (apical dominance) did not succeed. The presence of claforan did not affect shoot regeneration, but inoculations with Agrobacterium and the presence of kanamycin decreased regeneration moderately or considerably, respectively. The threshold for kanamycin concentration for screening for kanamycin resistant transformed raspberry tissue was 30 to 40 mg l$ sp{-1}.$ The best co-incubation interval between wild-type Agrobacterium and 'Comet' leaf discs ranged from 2 days for highly virulent strains to 3 or more days for moderate to low virulent strains. Among several wild-type strains, C58 was chosen as the most appropriate partially because a disarmed form was commercially available for use as a non-oncogenic vector for transformation of red raspberry. The binary plasmid pBI121 containing the marker genes NPTII and GUS encoding kanamycin resistance and $ beta$-glucuronidase activity, respectively, was successfully introduced into the Agrobacterium strain LBA4404, which is a disarmed C58 derivative. Transformation of 'Comet' red raspberry was apparently achieved by inoculating leaf disc explants with LBA4404 containing pBI121. The probable integration and expression of the foreign genes into the plant cells were confirmed by screening for kanamycin resistance, GUS assays and Southern blot analyses. This transformation system appears to be effective and may be useful in further studies on red raspberry for both introduction of genes for desirable agronomic traits and basic studies of gene expression.</description><creator>Faria, Maria José Sparça Salles de</creator><contributor>Tibellius, K.

Patterns were assessed over 14 months in groups of 10 rams and ewes, half of which received E$ sb2$ replacement (Silastic implants) at the time of gonadectomy to maintain blood E$ sb2$ at ram breeding-season values. Mean monthly PRL level (based on two 3-h periods of blood sampling) was consistently elevated by E$ sb2$ in the ram (mean 19%), and during all but a few months in the spring and summer in the ewes (mean 90%). Sex differences in the mean PRL were most apparent for the E$ sb2$-treated sheep in August (rams 280 $ pm$ 54 ng/ml vs ewes 128 $ pm$ 18 ng/ml) and for the control sheep in November (rams 19 $ pm$ 5 ng/ml vs ewes 10 $ pm$ 2 ng/ml). Episodic PRL secretion (with 5-min sampling for 4 h) was assessed in every season. In all four groups, pulse amplitude and frequency and basal level were higher in summer than winter. E$ sb2$ treatment was associated with larger PRL pulses in both sexes in every season but summer, and with decreased (from 8.2 to 4.6 per 4 h) and increased (from 2.2 to 6.6 per 4 h) frequencies of pulses in rams in the spring and summer, respectively. The PRL response to TRH (two iv injections 50 ng/kg BW given 80 min apart) was also assessed in every season. Mean 40-min increases after injection were highest in spring and summer. E$ sb2$ treatment produced in both sexes a 2-3 fold larger increment 1 in every season, and increment 2 in specific seasons. Preinjection and increment values were positively correlated within animals of each group across seasons (r = 0.89 and 0.65). The Incr 2/lncr 1 ratio (mean 0.76 $ pm$ 0.10) was not affected by seasons or E$ sb2$, and did not denote a self priming effect of TRH.

The distribution of AFP during ontogenic development and its abnormal reappearance in certain diseases is consistent with an immunoregulatory function. In vitro studies have demonstrated the immunomodulatory properties of AFP, prompting investigations into the relationship of molecular structure to biological function, which is not yet fully understood. The present thesis examines and compares the immunoregulatory activities of recombinant murine AFP (rMoAFP) with the fetal derived protein. The cDNA of mouse AFP was overexpressed by a modified baculovirus transfer vector, resulting in the secretion of soluble rMoAFP. The purified recombinant molecule was characterized by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, molecular weight determination, N-terminal sequencing and carbohydrate analysis. When rMoAFP was tested in parallel with the native molecule in several AFP sensitive immune assays, we determined that the recombinant molecule was functionally equivalent to the fetal derived protein with respect to immunoregulation. Since it has been reported that non-covalently associated molecules and post-translational modifications such as TGF-$ beta$2 and sialylation respectively may be necessary to impart the immunoregulatory activity to AFP, we also examined the potential contribution of such substances to the immunomodulating function of rMoAFP. Antibody blocking experiments, endotoxin analysis and functional assays performed in serum free conditions all indicated that post-translational modifications and exogenous ligands are not involved in AFP-mediated immunoregulation. The above results are the first to directly demonstrate that immunoregulation is an intrinsic property of AFP.</description><creator>Semeniuk, Daniel J.</creator><contributor>Murgita, Robert A.

Using a defined chemical medium toxin production was investigated for and it was found that trichothecenes were produced. A yeast bioassay using Kluyveromyces fragilis, an organiam sensitive to such trichothecenes as T-2 toxin and verrucarin, was used for detection of toxin in culture filtrates. Detectable levels of toxin (0.2 $ mu$g in litre of culture) were seen by day 4 and peaked around day 9 corresponding to maximum growth (measured by mycelial mass). After this time fluctuations in the level of toxin and growth became evident, suggesting a breakdown of the toxins by the organism for a carbon source. Search for an enzyme or enzyme system, capable of degrading T-2 toxin in snail gut enzyme digested F. oxysporum, was attempted using the esterase substrate para-nitrophenol acetate. Esterase activity was detected in all fractions including culture filtrate, soluble protein fraction and insoluble protein fraction, as well as solubilized insoluble proteins (digested by contents of the crude extract). The soluble protein fraction exhibited the highest level of activity. Cells digested with the detergent Lubrol followed by precipitation of the solubilized proteins with ammonium sulphate revealed the presence of an active component(s) in the high molecular weight portion of the soluble cell fraction collected at 50 and 75% saturation. Further purification by DEAE-sepharose failed to produce an active component.</description><creator>Kearvell, Joan</creator><contributor>Ingram, J. M.
