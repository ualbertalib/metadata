Organic farming -- Québec (Province).
Consumer supported agriculture (CSA) is a mutually beneficial
        food system that is based on forward contracts between a farmer and
        consumers. CSA emphasizes organic production methods, and local
        production for local consumption. A review of the literature on CSA
        indicates that it is thriving as an alternative to the conventional
        food system. Yet, the sustainable growth of the CSA food system is
        threatened by high partner turnover. A case study of the Equiterre
        CSA network was done to identify causes of high partner turnover.
        378 useable surveys, out of 500 sent out, were used to identify
        factors that influence satisfaction and the likelihood to renew the
        partnership. An ordered probit model was estimated for each
        dependent variable. Nine factors each were found to significantly
        influence satisfaction and the likelihood to renew partnership.
        Satisfaction with product quantity, quality and price, and partner
        perception of their ability to influence basket contents were
        statistically significant in the both models. Satisfaction with the
        location of delivery points was significant in the renewal model.
        In terms of socio-demographic variables, income and the number of
        children under 12 years in a household both had negative effects on
        satisfaction while age had a positive effect on renewal. A high
        correlation (r=0.7) between global satisfaction and renewal
        suggests that CSAs can reduce the turnover rate by delivering in
        areas that influence global satisfaction with the system. The
        results suggest that the single most important area in this regard
        is that of choice and variety of produce. A more flexible system of
        constituting baskets and a more diversified selection of produce
        may be useful areas of focus on the farmers' part.

On décrit la synthèse des
        monomethoxytrityl-5'-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-2' levulinyl-3'
        ribonucléosides des quatre bases communes ainsi que les dérives
        isomères 2',3'. Ces unités permettent la synthèse
        d'oligonucléotides par blocs suivant le précède de couplage au
        chlorophosphite. La méthode est illustrée par la préparation, en
        ban rendement, de l'acide hexadecauridylique. Une nouvelle synthèse
        de ribonucleotides en phase solide fut étudiée. Le support utilise
        est un gel de silice et le précède de phosphorylation est celui du
        chlorophosphite. On met en évidence l'efficacité de la méthode en
        préparant, par étape, le nonadecamere correspondant à la boucle
        dihydrouridine du t-RNAfMet. On introduit aussi plusieurs réactifs
        capables d'hydrolyser les nucléotides du polymère. De plus, on
        examine une nouvelle oxidation nonaqueuse des phosphites de
        trialkyles à l'aide de l'acide metachloroperbenzoique. On rapporte
        également l'isolement et les propriétés d'oligonucleoside
        phosphites ainsi que leur utilité pour la synthèse
        d'oligoribonucleotides. […] Les diribonucleosides monophosphates de
        l'uridine ayant un lien symétrique (5'-5', 3'-3', 2',2') furent
        facilement prépares grâce à la méthode de couplage au
        chlorophosphite. La stabilité de ces dimères quant a l’ hydrolyse
        en milieu acide, basique et enzymatique fut aussi étudiée. Enfin,
        on propose !'utilisation du groupement levulinyle pour la
        protection de la fonction amine des nucléosides.
