In particular, the relation between the Darboux integrability of an arbitrary hyperbolic equation and the Laplace invariants of the linearization of this equation is established. This extends to non-linear hyperbolic equations in the plane a classical result of Goursat for linear hyperbolic equations. The formal setting for this geometric investigation is afforded by the constrained variational bicomplex, which allows the solution to a partial differential equation to be viewed as a manifold on which standard differential geometric operations such as exterior differentiation and Lie differentiation can be performed. The key element in this investigation is the judicious construction and use of appropriate moving coframes which will reflect the properties of the equations under investigation.</description><creator>Mansouri, Abdol-Reza, 1962-</creator><contributor>Kamran, Niky (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Mathematics.</subject><title>The variational bicomplex for hyperbolic equations /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pn89d8365.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/b5644t307</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:t435gf758</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:00:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is defined by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) and clinical manifestations. It is unclear why some patients have high levels of aPL, but no clinical symptoms, while others develop APS. Recent studies have demonstrated T cell reactivity to beta2-glycoprotein I (beta2GPI) in patients with APS. To understand why a T cell response develops selectively in some individuals the requirements for antigen presentation and T cell reactivity were evaluated in a murine model of aPL induction. aPL were readily induced in immunized mice, and required MHC class II, but not CD1, antigen presentation. In contrast, induction of a measurable T cell response to beta2GPI necessitated hyperimmunization in the presence of a polyclonal activator. T cells reacted more to reduced, than native, beta2GPI, suggesting that disulfide bond reduction facilitates antigen processing. These results suggest that a T cell response to beta2GPI occurs only in individuals repeatedly exposed to antigen in a proinflammatory environment.</description><creator>Palerme, Jean-Sebastien.</creator><contributor>Rauch, Joyce (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><title>Factors influencing the murine B and T cell response to human 2-glycoprotein I</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3n2040939.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t435gf758</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sn00b059h</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:00:27Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Mobile applications provide services that can benefit various sectors of the society. It is imperative that the realization of mobile applications be well-planned and based on standards. The interplay of Extensible Markup Language (XML)-based technologies, software engineering principles, and "best practices" formalized as patterns provides such a systematic approach. This thesis formulates a rigorous classification of mobile application patterns into four categories: architecture, process, product, and usage. To express the patterns in a universal manner, an XML-based pattern notation, the Mobile Application Patterns Markup Language (MAPML), is introduced. Based on a requirements analysis and design description, the specification of MAPML is given. MAPML is equipped with a collection of tools that includes formal grammars for MAPML, and solutions for authoring, processing, and presenting MAPML documents on the Web. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the current state of work and directions for future improvement.</description><creator>Pai, Hsueh-Ieng, 1975-</creator><contributor>Newborn, Monty (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Computer Science.</subject><title>Applications of extensible markup language to mobile application patterns</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j38608665.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/sn00b059h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Computer Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:j67315718</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:00:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Melatonin is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland, which is known to modulate biological rhythms in mammals. This study investigated the effect of food access schedule and dietary composition on serum melatonin and pineal NAT activity in adult male Wistar rats. These rats were maintained on a 12:12 h light:dark schedule with lights on at 0800h. The rats were randomly assigned to two dietary groups. A group was simultaneously fed a protein-rich and carbohydrate-rich granulated diet and the other group fed granulated rat chow. Each dietary group was further divided based on dietary feeding schedules. Animals were fed between 0800--1600 h or fed ad libitum. The study revealed that protein intake of rats fed the dietary choice was lower with the restricted access than in the free access. In rats fed dietary choice, the nocturnal melatonin levels and pineal NAT activity were significantly lower under the restricted access feeding when compared to the ad libitum feeding schedule. This was not observed in rats fed single chow diet. In conclusion our data demonstrate that food composition does affect the nocturnal synthesis of melatonin as well as the activity of the enzyme NAT. This could be via dietary intake of tryptophan, which is a precursor melatonin synthesis in the pineal gland.</description><creator>Oguine, Adaora.</creator><contributor>Thibault, L.

Detection of flower and fruit infections enables producers to make intelligent management decisions. A plate-trapped ELISA protocol using a Botrytis-specific monoclonal antibody (BC-12.CA4) was developed for the detection of Botrytis cinerea in strawberry flower receptacles and red fruits. Horseradish peroxidase, was chosen as enzyme conjugate because it gave lower background absorbance in disease-free samples. B. cinerea reference antigen (RAg) was isolated from strawberry. BC-12.CA4 was very sensitive to the RAg, detecting up to 6 mug/ml of RAg when mixed with strawberry extracts. The MAb did not show any reaction to Rhizopus sp., Mucor sp. and Penicillium sp. associated with strawberry. B. cinerea could be detected in receptacles two days after inoculation. Treatment of inoculated receptacles with paraquat speeded-up detection. Inoculated red fruit infection could be detected after three days of incubation. Disease in commercially-produced receptacles and red fruits were assessed visually and by ELISA. The ELISA detected B. cinerea in 95% of commercial flower samples, whereas the traditional visual method detected only 50 to 70%. No dramatic differences between methods were found for red fruits.</description><creator>Mohr, Alexandra.</creator><date>2001</date><subject>Fungal diseases of plants.</subject><subject>Botrytis cinerea.</subject><subject>Monoclonal antibodies -- Diagnostic use.</subject><subject>Strawberries -- Diseases and pests -- Monitoring.</subject><title>Use of a monoclonal antibody to detect gray mold (Botrytis cinerea) in strawberry</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/z890rw246.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/cv43nz96t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Plant Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5h73px79j</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:00:28Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The tetrode is a recording device formed of four recording wires used to improve single unit discrimination in multi-unit recordings. Here, tetrodes were used to record and characterize the activity of multiple different cell types at one locus in the superior colliculus (SC). This project entailed the configuration of the tetrode and data analysis software for recording in the SC. Problems of adequate sampling rates, transfer to disc of large files, identification of spikes in the presence of noise, distortion of spike shapes by simultaneously firing cells and noise, reliable criteria for distinguishing individual cells, time varying changes in spike shapes, and relating individual discharges to motor behavior were addressed. A sampling rate of 35.7 kHz was achieved on each tetrode wire. It was found that peak and valley amplitude parameters are usually sufficient for spike separation but the user must employ various combinations of parameters in order to achieve the most reliable results. Finally, cell analysis indicates that the tetrode is capable of successfully recording from multiple cells of different types in the colliculus, such as buildup and visual.</description><creator>Murphy, Jeremy C.</creator><contributor>Guitton, Daniel (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Engineering, Biomedical.</subject><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Development of the tetrode recording apparatus for simultaneous recording of multiple single cells in the superior colliculus of the cat</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/x920fz47p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5h73px79j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:g732db736</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:00:29Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Urolithiasis occurs in 20% of males and 5--10% of females, and 75% of kidney stones contain calcium oxalate (CO) mineral. To analyze mineral-binding proteins and to make gender comparisons, using the model of Doyle et al. (Clin Chem, 37: 1589--1594, 1991), CO crystals were generated in whole and centrifuged urine samples and then washed with water or sodium hydroxide. Crystals and mineral-binding proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting and electron microscopy (SEM). Regardless of urine or crystal treatment, osteopontin and UPTF1 proteins were consistently present in the samples, whereas THP and albumin were partially removed. SEM showed larger crystals precipitated from female than from male urine. Western blotting demonstrated more albumin bound to crystals from females. In other experiments, CO crystals were grown in the presence of poly-L-aspartic acid (PA) and albumin. SEM demonstrated that these proteins affected CO crystallization. Competitive protein-binding assays and fluorescence activated cell sorter analysis after binding of PA and albumin to hydroxyapatite indicated that PA binds hydroxyapatite with a stronger affinity than albumin.</description><creator>Nguyen, Quynh Dung Sarah.</creator><contributor>McKee, Marc D.

(1) The carbon dioxide and oxygen exchange rates (V̊O2 and V̊CO2) through the lungs and the CAM were separately, but simultaneously, measured during the last two days of incubation (day 20--21), while ventilation (V̊E) was calculated from the measurements of pressure oscillations in the air cell. When the embryo's total metabolic rate was increased, V̊E was linearly proportional to lung V̊O2 and V̊CO2 and not to the embryo's total metabolic rate. (2) Tracheal pressure and changes in lung volume were quantified through mechanical ventilation of the embryo. The curled up posture of the embryo, the eggshell and its membranes did not represent a significant mechanical constraint to V̊E. (3) V̊E, lung V̊O2 and V̊CO 2 were measured while the CAM compartment was exposed to either 10% O2, 100% O2 or 5% CO2. Total V̊O2 was also measured under these conditions. There is a clear V̊E-sensitivity to CO2 and a rather weak V̊E-sensitivity to changes in arterial oxygenation present at this stage of development.</description><creator>Menna, Tara Marisa.</creator><contributor>Mortola, Jacopo P.

We have examined the role of two such proteins, p73 and SHP-2, in cultured post-natal sympathetic neurons, a model system for developing peripheral neurons. p73 is a newly identified member of the p53 tumor suppressor family that exists as both truncated and full-length isoforms. We found that p73 is expressed in the developing nervous system as a truncated isoform (DeltaNp73) whose protein levels dramatically decreased when sympathetic neurons apoptose following NGF withdrawal. Ectopic expression of DeltaNp73 prevented this death. GST-pull down experiments suggested a physical interaction between DeltaNp73 and p53 in vitro, and expressing DeltaNp73 in sympathetic neurons attenuated p53-induced death. p73 -/- mice showed an increased amount of developmental sympathetic neuron death. These data indicate that DeltaNp73 is an important pro-survival protein that may function by directly inhibiting p53's pro-apoptotic activity. A second protein that was examined was SHP-2, a phosphotyrosine phosphatase. We observed that SHP-2 modulates the survival of sympathetic neurons through two independent pathways downstream of TrkA. Inhibiting SHP-2 enhanced GAB-1 phosphorylation and blocked ERK phosphorylation, suggesting that a normal role for SHP-2 in neurons is to enhance ERK activity and ERK-mediated pro-survival signals.</description><creator>Radinovic, Stevo.</creator><contributor>Kaplan, David R.

Discharge prescription data were analyzed for patients ≥65 years old hospitalized for AMI in Quebec between 1996 and 1998. Among those prescribed an ACE inhibitor (n = 6,287), the association between the specific drug prescribed and mortality following AMI was studied using Cox proportional-hazards models. A propensity score analysis compared short-acting with long-acting ACE inhibitors to account for confounding by indication. After adjusting for potentially confounding variables, enalapril, fosinopril, and captopril appeared less effective than ramipril at reducing mortality---hazard ratios (and 95% CI): 1.38 (1.01 to 1.89), 1.47 (1.05 to 2.05), and 1.46 (1.05 to 2.03), respectively. Lisinopril appeared to be as effective as ramipril. Short-acting ACE inhibitors were associated with higher mortality than long-acting ACE inhibitors, but only in certain subgroups. Among patients prescribed an ACE inhibitor following AMI, it appears that the mortality benefits differ according to the specific drug prescribed.</description><creator>Rodrigues, Eric John.</creator><contributor>Paradis, Gilles (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Pilote, Louise (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</subject><title>The effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on mortality following acute myocardial infarction /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rf55z953k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0z708z544</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:bc386m18q</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:00:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The exchange of carbon and water between a temperate peatland and the atmosphere was studied directly for the vascular plants; Chamaedaphne calyculata, Kalmia angustifolia, Vaccinium myrtilloides, and Maianthemum trifolium and indirectly for the bryophytes; Sphagnum rubellum and S. magellanicum. In vascular plants, carbon and water fluxes were well coupled (~2.27 mumol CO 2 mmol-1 H2O) except in the post-deciduous period where temperature constrained water flux more than carbon flux. The seasonal cycle of Sphagnum water content was driven by water table depth; rain depth, rain frequency and atmospheric vapor pressure deficit. In 2000, these factors combined to cause primarily over saturation with regard to optimal net photosynthesis in Sphagnum. Carbon and water exchange at the community scale was also studied and related to the leaf level patterns observed. Few leaf level patterns were observable at the community scale although the effects of species composition and leaf area index were well represented in the community signal.</description><creator>Reimer, Adam.</creator><contributor>Roulet, Nigel (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Bog plants -- Ontario -- Ottawa Region.</subject><subject>Carbon cycle (Biogeochemistry) -- Ontario -- Ottawa Region.</subject><subject>Atmospheric carbon dioxide -- Ontario -- Ottawa Region.</subject><subject>Peatlands -- Ontario -- Ottawa Region.</subject><title>The role of bog plants in the exchange of carbon dioxide and water between the atmosphere and the Mer Bleue peatland /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0c483m00h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bc386m18q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:8g84mp09b</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:00:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The present project aimed at measuring plant heavy metal uptake as a function of transpiration rates and dissolved heavy metal level in the soil solution. Two experiment was conducted separately in two season (Spring and Fall 2000). In these two experiments, young wheat plants ( Triticum aestivum) were irrigated with nine different solutions containing Cd and Zn. The study was conducted in two chambers where relative humidity was controlled to obtain two different levels of transpiration rates. Each control chambers contained 27 pots filled with sand and seeded with wheat plants, each nine triplicated pots receiving a different treatment: three Cd treatments with levels of 0.01, 0.10, and 0.50 mg/L; one Zn treatment with level of 25mg/L and four treatment combinations of Cd/Zn with levels of 0.01 Cd/25Zn, 0.10Cd/25ZN, 0.50Cd/25Zn and 0.50Cd/50Zn mg/L. The transpiration rate of the plants was monitored over a period of 30 days, measured from the emergence of the plants by weighing the pots daily. On day 15 and 30, three plants were removed from each pot, to weigh their dry matter production and to analyze their heavy metal uptake.

This algorithm employs a penalty function theorem and a simulated annealing (SA) routine to model a large-scale constrained optimization problem incorporating dose and dose volume constraints in reflecting the goal of inverse treatment planning by sparing sufficient healthy tissues while delivering a necessary tumorcidal dose. The convergence property of the dose-volume SA algorithm is investigated for validation. Its performance is also evaluated by comparing the algorithm with a gradient technique minimizing the same dose-volume objective function that incorporates the target dose objectives and organ dose-volume constraints by the penalty functions. The comparison shows that the objective function exhibits a global valley in which multiple local minima with similar outcomes in terms of the function values, the dose-volume histograms, and the dose distributions exist. Thus, the gradient algorithm is preferred for this optimization approach due to its fast efficiency.</description><creator>Sham, Edwin O.

Density perturbations are generally +/-200 kg/m 3 within the crustal layers, with peaks of up to +/-400 kg/m 3. These perturbations diminish quickly with depth, becoming less than +/-80 kg/m3 by 150 km depth, and generally less than +/-5 kg/m3 by 300 km depth. The major stress differences associated with the mascon basins are found in the upper mantle reaching maximums of 6--8 MPa at about 150 km depth. The introduction of a partially molten layer in the upper mantle increases the stresses in the overlying strata significantly. The stresses for this type of model reach values above 10 MPa beneath the major mascon basins, between the base of the crust to the top of the partially molten layer, at 180 km depth.

Chicks aged 10-days exhibited partially functioning adrenocortical systems with baseline levels comparable to adults. The ability to respond to external stressors increased through postnatal development and by the age of 22 days, stress-induced maximal levels of corticosterone were indistinguishable from those of one-year old adults, and levels of 28-day old birds were significantly higher than these adults. In addition, baseline and maximum stress-induced levels of corticosterone at all ages were significantly higher in first-hatched chicks than all other siblings and these effects grew stronger through development. These results suggest that the brain-pituitary-adrenal axis in this semi-altricial species is (1) already partially developed in young chicks and (2) only becomes fully functional when behavioral and neuromuscular development is nearly complete. Furthermore, results from this study suggest that hatching asynchrony has an effect on this variation in stress-induced maximal levels of corticosterone during the latter half of postnatal development, with a higher degree of hatching asynchrony leading to larger disparity in adrenocortical function between first- and fourth-hatched chicks. This adrenocortical disparity resulting from female-mediated hatching asynchrony may potentially lead to both brood-reduction and brood survival under diametric food conditions, ensuring that the female's reproductive fitness is maximized in varying habitats. Variation of adrenocortical function among siblings may increase female efficiency in raising a brood of fit chicks, maximizing her reproductive success.</description><creator>Love, Oliver Patrick.</creator><contributor>Bird, David M.

Extrinsic factors affect development as well as intrinsic developmental cues. In order to investigate the molecular basis of initiation of postembryonic development, a genetic screen was performed to identify temperature-sensitive mutants that cannot initiate the cell divisions associated with postembryonic development at the restrictive temperature. Hydroxyurea (HU), a DNA replication inhibitor, was used as a tool to select against worms that initiate postembryonic cell divisions and/or the developmental program. 1,600,000 haploid genomes were screened, and 20 mutants have been isolated. 6 of them have been mapped to a relatively small genetic interval, and one inx-6 has been cloned and encodes an innexin family protein. Mutation of inx-6 caused abnormalities in pharyngeal pumping, resulting in worms that could not feed. The functions of a cyclin B homologue (ZC168.4) in postembryonic development have also been studied since cyclin B mutants also have postembryonic developmental arrest phenotype. Results indicate that zygotic expression of cyclin B is absolutely required for normal postembryonic development. Moreover, we found a novel function of this cyclin B homologue, which demonstrates an uncommon paternal effect required for spermatogenesis and/or fertilization.</description><creator>Li, Shaolin, 1973-</creator><contributor>Roy, Richard (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2001</date><subject>Caenorhabditis elegans -- Genetics.</subject><subject>Caenorhabditis elegans -- Development.</subject><subject>Cyclin B.</subject><title>Genetic analysis of the initiation of postembryonic development in Caenorhabditis elegans</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ht24wm05h.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3t945s634</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1544br23x</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:00:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Objective. To determine whether having a condition of unknown medical cause contributes to perceived stigma in individuals with functional somatic syndromes (FSS). Methods. Subjects in three FSS groups, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), fibromyalgia (FM), and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), were matched to medical control groups. Self-report measures were used to collect sociodemographic information, and rates of depression, physical functioning, and perceived stigma. Results. Having the FSS was associated with perceived stigma in CFS compared to the medical control group, and remained an independent predictor when controlling for depression and physical functioning on multivariate analysis. These effects were not seen in FM or IBS compared to medical control groups. Conclusions. The ambiguity of having a medically unexplained syndrome may contribute to perceived stigma in CFS. The absence of this effect in FM and IBS may reflect a greater acceptance of FM and IBS as medical conditions.</description><creator>Looper, Karl J.</creator><contributor>Kirmayer, Laurence (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2002</date><subject>Psychology, Social.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Mental Health.</subject><title>Perceived stigma in functional somatic syndromes and comparable medical conditions</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/kw52j974k.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1544br23x</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Psychiatry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sj139380h</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:00:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The relationship between migraine and bipolar disorder was the main interest of this study. The objectives were several: (1) to determine the prevalence of migraine in a clinical bipolar population and compare it to the rate in the general population; (2) to examine if there were any clinical differences between the bipolar groups with and without migraine; and lastly, (3) to determine the prevalence of migraine treatment among the bipolar population. Two questionnaires were administered to diagnose migraine and gather information about the clinical course of bipolar illness. The results showed a migraine rate among females of 43.8% and 31.5% among males which were both higher than in the general population. Migraine was also found to be underdiagnosed and undertreated.

The four participants, (two male and two female) range in age from 29 years to 74 years. They live with a variety of chronic illnesses (heart disease, Multiple Sclerosis, and Pick's disease). Narrative analysis of the four semi-structured transcribed interviews revealed four dominant themes: the emotional reaction to diagnosis; the role of stress in aggravating and coping with chronic illness; a view of death; the meaning attributed to illness. A postmodern perspective is employed to explicate the social construction of the notion of chronic illness. A critique of the medical discourse regarding chronic health challenges is offered. This study invites social workers to consider their position of power and privilege as they learn new ways of listening to illness narratives.</description><creator>Docherty, Deborah.</creator><contributor>Leonard, P.

The co-expression of keratin 8, 18 and vimentin has been shown to be related to recurrence and metastasis in both cutaneous and uveal melanomas. This thesis provides the first immunohistochemical evidence that the co-expression of keratin 8, 18 and vimentin is present in one third of conjunctival melanomas. The results show that conjunctival melanomas co-expressing IFs are mixed cell tumors with diffuse growth patterns. It is also shown that melanoma cells co-expressing IFs are mainly located around the peripheral or marginal area of the tumors. In addition, this thesis indicates that the initial tumor thickness significantly increases in conjunctival melanomas co-expressing IFs. Therefore, it is demonstrated that the co-expression of IFs plays an important role in influencing the malignant progression of conjunctival melanomas, and the co-expression of IFs can be used as a prognostic marker for conjunctival melanomas.</description><creator>Zhang, Yi, 1956-</creator><contributor>Burnier, Miguel N., Jr. (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Health Sciences, Pathology.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Oncology.</subject><title>Intermediate filaments : the prognostic marker for conjunctival melanomas</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/xk81jn31r.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/3b591b13v</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Pathology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:n296x082p</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:00:34Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Munchausen By Proxy Syndrome is a form of child abuse whereby parents induce symptoms of real illness, or falsely report symptoms, to initiate medical treatment for their children. Following a review of the literature with respect to case management, the author presents for study a case followed from initial suspicion to resolution two years later. The management of this case is compared to what the literature would suggest is the ideal practice. Areas of weakness are found to be the average social worker's lack of knowledge about the syndrome, due to its rarity, agency unpreparedness to deal with a case, over-reliance upon medical opinion and a lack of advice as to the long term likelihood of family reunification.

W. &amp; Kahn, R. L., 1987). In rats, variations in cognitive performance due to age are frequently assessed in tests of spatial abilities such as the Morris water maze (Issa, A. M., Rowe, W., Gauthier, S., &amp; Meaney, M. J., 1990; Quirion, R. et al., 1995; Aubert, I., Rowe, W., Meaney, M. J., Gauthier, S., &amp; Quirion, R., 1995). BIBN 99, a highly specific M2 receptor antagonist, reverses impaired ACh release as well as the cognitive deficits of aged, impaired (AI) rats observed in the Morris water maze (Aubert, I., Rowe, W., Meaney, M. J., Gauthier, S., &amp; Quirion, R., 1995; Quirion, R. et al., 1995). To further characterize the potential benefits of BIBN 99, we tested (AI), aged, cognitively unimpaired (AU) and young (Y) rats in an object recognition task (ORT) and pre-pulse inhibition of acoustic startle (PPI). Both groups of vehicle-treated aged animals demonstrated reduced exploratory activity in the ORT compared to Y vehicle-treated animals. However, pre-treatment with BIBN 99 (0.5mg/kg) increased overall exploration time in AI and AU animals while having no effect in the Y group. In contrast, BIBN 99 had no effect on PPI in any of the groups. While these results are inconclusive concerning support for the potential relevance of BIBN 99 in the treatment of cognitive disorders, further research is warranted.</description><creator>Pearson, Debra Marie.</creator><contributor>Rochford, Joseph (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Quirion, Remi (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Psychology, Experimental.</subject><subject>Biology, Neuroscience.</subject><title>Effects of M2 autoreceptor blockade on the cognitive performance of aged impaired, aged unimpaired and young rats</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/bz60cz29j.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/zk51vj54q</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Division of Neuroscience</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:2801pj14v</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:00:36Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Some species of sundew (Drosera spp.), harvested from the wild for use in homeopathic cold remedies, are now endangered. This research consisted of two experiments in hydroponic production of sundew. The first investigated the effects of four nitrogen (N) fertilization levels (0.0, 5.1, 25.5 or 51.0 mg/L added N) and three harvest methods (after two months, four months, and sequential harvest at two and four months) on the growth of Drosera adelae (F. Muell.). In addition, the effect of N on the production of a medicinal active ingredient in D. adelae was examined. The second experiment investigated effects of the same nitrogen treatments in combination with three substrates (long fiber sphagnum, peat or rockwool) on growth. The growth rate of D. adelae was greatest at low levels of nitrogen fertilization, and slowed after two months of growth. Plants that were sequentially harvested had the lowest growth rate among all the harvest method treatments. Young plants and plants that received little or no N fertilizer had a greater water concentration than the other plants. Substrate and N level interacted, but generally peat and rockwool produced greater yields than did sphagnum. The medicinal compound plumbagin and a similar but unidentified compound were detected in the leaf extracts of D. adelae. However, whether N fertilization influenced the concentration of these compounds remains inconclusive.</description><creator>Owen, Josée.</creator><contributor>Fortin, Marc (Supervisor)</contributor><date>2000</date><subject>Sundews -- Growth.</subject><subject>Medicinal plants -- Growth.</subject><subject>Cold (Disease) -- Homeopathic treatment.</subject><title>The effects of nitrogen, harvest method and substrate on the growth and the medicinal compound concentration of hydroponically-grown sundew (Drosera adelae F.
