The focus is primarily on OPAP, a mixed extractant consisting of mono- and di-octyl phenyl phosphoric acids, as well as on di-(2-ethyl hexyl) phosphoric acid (D2EHPA). The effects of certain parameters on the extraction of nickel, both quantitative and qualitative, have been studied. The parameters include: modifier presence, concentration and type; OPAP concentration; phase ratio; aqueous environment; age of organic solution; and mono-/di-OPAP ratio. The ability to strip nickel from the organic solution as well as selectivity and kinetic tests were carried out. The use of 10% isodecanol as a modifier was found to be essential for the purpose of OPAP solubility in kerosene and phase separation. Furthermore, the cation exchange reaction proceeds very quickly, attaining equilibrium within 10 minutes. Unlike other phosphoric acid reagents, OPAP is able to extract significant amounts of nickel in the acidic pH range of 1 to 2. As well, nickel is easily stripped using a 1.0 M sulphuric acid solution.</description><creator>Ciriello, Carmine</creator><contributor>Distin, P. A.

Practices that involve detailed simulation of the complete flow field, including flow through the orifices, are limited by the need for extensive grid refinement near each orifice, and by slow convergence rates. Other approaches, such as modeling of the flow in each domain separately, and linking these flows by one-dimensional flow networks, reduce the accuracy of the solution. In this thesis, an alternative treatment is developed in which finite-volume modeling (FVM) inside the slot is replaced by specified flow conditions at the slot boundaries. These conditions are updated once per iteration by a correlation function, based on flow conditions local to the slot, as generated by the primary-domain FVM solution. The correlation function is derived empirically, using data from detailed numerical simulations. Application of this approach to laminar flow in two parallel channels linked by a small slot has produced encouraging results.</description><creator>Goldman, Avrum</creator><contributor>Baliga, B. R.

In order to design this device, a new mechanism is put forward, which is fully parallel and string driven. It achieves kinematic and dynamic isotropy. From the kinematic and dynamic analysis, the conditions for obtaining the best performance results are derived. These form the basis for the design and lead to a high performance device, which has wide bandwidth, low friction and which is free from backlash.

But are there words that can express the horror of the Holocaust? Would silence not be more appropriate in respect to the victims? Elie Wiesel is not the first to confront such a dilemma. Throughout Jewish history, tragedies and catastrophes have forced Jewish writers to face the issue. Many literary schools have emerged, particularly in the "modern period" (1850-1945), which have dealt with the question of how to best respond to the tragedy. It is therefore fitting to try and consider Elie Wiesel's works in light of these various literary currents. However, the Holocaust is not just another tragedy, not even another catastrophe. The event has no precedent; it is unique; it represents the ultimate evil. How to come to terms with it? What is the way between the powerlessness of language and the impossibility of silence? Elie Wiesel must find the delicate art of making silence be heard beyond the noise of words. He will suggest rather than tell the event. He will maintain a distance to protect the secret of the victims in front of the horror. Survivors who share the secret, express themselves with a code, which is not transmissible. Language has been devalued and words have lost their meaning. But to remain silent might also be a form of treason. From Night, his first book, and throughout all his works, Wiesel assiduously develops his way of bearing witness in the name of the victims. He rejects the silence which would be synonymous with passive acceptance. He identifies with Job and demands account from God for His absence and His silence, while evil was committed. He distrusts language but must find the way to translate the uniqueness of the Holocaust. He finds his inspiration in the tales and legends of the literature of the Bible, the Talmud and the Hassidism. He evokes, suggests and tells while trying to respect the blanks between the words. In language and in silence, Wiesel developed a certain art of suggesting for what cannot be told otherwise.</description><creator>Toledano, Dorith</creator><contributor>Anctil, Pierre (Supervisor)</contributor><contributor>Morisot, Jean-Claude (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Wiesel, Elie, 1928- -- Criticism and interpretation</subject><title>L'écriture et le silence chez Elie Wiesel</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dz010q918.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/hh63sw661</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Département de langue et littérature françaises</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wm117p74h</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:32:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Emissions of methane were measured by a static chamber technique at 9 sites on 5 wetlands in the Eastern Temperate Wetland Region, north of Montreal. Mean daily methane fluxes measured from May to October ranged from 0.18 to 1071 mg/m$ sp2$/d, and estimated annual flux ranged from 0.02 to 186 g/m$ sp2$/y. Laboratory incubations of peat samples showed potential anaerobic methane production rates which ranged from 0.00 to 9.12 $ mu$g/g/d, and potential aerobic consumption rates from 0.55 to 3.75 $ mu$g/g/d. Seasonal methane emission patterns are related to water table level and CH$ sb4$ production and consumption potentials in the peat profile. Episodic fluxes were found to be important at several sites, contributing a significant portion of the total emissions. Analysis of spectral reflectance data from 20 sites on 2 subarctic fens was carried out to address the issue of scaling up CH$ sb4$ emissions using satellite imagery. Hummocks, lawns and pools were found to be spectrally distinct enough to be differentiated by band 5 of Landsat MSS and band 3 of Landsat TM sensors. The averaging of spectral information in mixed pixels proved unlikely to be able to distinguish between wet lawn and string and pool communities. Such weaknesses can be overcome with the use of higher resolution data.</description><creator>Windsor, James</creator><contributor>Moore, T. R.

The method of velocity singularities was originally developed by Mateescu and Newman in conjunction with a polynomial representation of the normal perturbation velocities. The present method uses a cubic spline representation of the aerofoil contour, which led to improvements in the accuracy and stability of the solution, especially in the case of the jet-flapped aerofoils. This method has been first validated for the cases of rigid and flexible aerofoils. The pressure distributions obtained with the spline formulation have proven to be in good agreement with the previous solutions based on conformal transformation, or obtained by Thwaites, Nielsen, and by Mateescu and Newman. The spline-velocity singularity method has been used for the jet flapped aerofoils and then extended to analyze the aerofoils with multiple sections, such as aerofoils with a flap. The solutions for these problems have been found to be in good agreement with the results obtained theoretically or experimentally by Spence, and Dimmock, and by Seebohm and Newman, based on a surface vortex method. The spline-velocity singularity method displayed a better accuracy and an enhanced stability of the solution, in comparison with the polynomial formulation, especially in the cases when the aerofoil contour is not known a priori, such as for the flexible or jet-flapped aerofoils.</description><creator>Dunn, Rob</creator><contributor>Mateescu, Dan F.

A composite clone containing three individual cDNAs was isolated. These included a 711 bp cDNA encoding part of mouse testicular N-cadherin, an unidentified 392 bp cDNA, and a 1500 bp cDNA encoding the mouse homologue of a human breast tumor autoantigen. The cadherins, the influenza strain A hemagglutinins, and the fibroblast growth factor receptors are three different families of integral membrane glycoproteins that harbour the amino acid motif histidine-alanine-valine (HAV) in regions involved in protein-protein interactions. In order to identify other proteins that possess the HAV motif in functionally important regions, the SwissProt database was searched using a consensus sequence derived from the cadherins, influenza strain A hemagglutinins, and fibroblast growth factor receptors. This search identified the $ alpha$ chains of the HLA class I histocompatibility antigens as a fourth family of integral membrane glycoproteins with an HAV-containing region that is involved in a protein-protein interaction.

Data sources were the medical charts of 449 patients discharged during two corresponding 28 day periods (one before end one after the implementation of rounds) supplemented by Discharge Planning Committee minutes (DPCM) and interviews with four key informants. No significant differences in the timing of social work intervention, LOS, or readmissions were found between the two samples. Qualitative research revealed that essential components were either missing (physician participation), or not uniformly included (family participation) in rounds, and that staff felt that rounds improved communication among the disciplines and contributed to improved efficiency in planning hospital and posthospital services. These findings highlight the need to further study all aspects of the complex discharge planning process to identify factors that would reduce LOS and readmissions.</description><creator>Dulka, Iryna M, 1953-</creator><contributor>Duder, Sydney (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Hospital utilization -- Length of stay -- Canada.</subject><subject>Older people -- Hospital care -- Canada.</subject><subject>Hospitals -- Admission and discharge.</subject><title>Interdisciplinary discharge planning rounds : impact on timing of social work intervention, length of stay and readmission</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ht24wk07v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1c18dg55j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Social Work</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>School of Social Work</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:47429b041</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:32:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The thesis examines aspects of the construction of methylmercury as an authoritative object of knowledge for Chisasibi, a Cree community on the James Bay coast in northern Quebec. I describe the evolution of a particular set of spheres of exchange which mediate economic relations between the Cree communities, the governments of Quebec and Canada, and state and corporate structures tied to the state. Knowledge claims about mercury can be seen as situated among claims of injury in a moral economy which is based on conflict over the James Bay hydro-electric project. The politicization and subsequent medicalization of these knowledge claims are described. Finally, I trace the emergence of particular concepts of 'normality', 'risk' and 'risk group' in medical and technocratic discourses about the effects of methylmercury on Canadian aboriginal populations.</description><creator>Scott, Richard T.

L. Doctorow. It makes clear that the characters in the stories as well as their creator frequently try to break free from restrictions or control--the protagonists physically, the author more theoretically. A description of the nature of the confinements as well as the difficulties associated with getting away reveals much about Doctorow's perception of 20th century American reality and the writer's place in it. Thus, the study moves from a relatively straightforward assessment of the kinds of escape featured in Doctorow's narratives and the way in which these are justified to a more complicated evaluation of Doctorow's situation as a writer in relation to his characters' predicaments and recent critical analyses of his prose.</description><creator>Sautter, Sabine</creator><contributor>Gibian, P.

A theoretical framework is provided by recent literature in development studies and human geography, which attempts to move away from an essentialist and ethnocentric development praxis, and towards a locally-based, participatory process of empowerment. From the perspective of such 'alternative' development ideas, orthodox strategies involving modernization, formalization of economic activities, and resource mobilization, can be reassessed. The promotion of pond aquaculture--and the widespread mangrove deforestation associated with it--is shown to be a strategy endorsed and supported by national and international development agencies. What is often overlooked, however, is the local ecological and economic importance of mangrove ecosystems. This study examines the effects of mangrove removal and fishpond development on the entitlements of people in three coastal communities in the Philippines. Aquacultural development is shown to have detrimental effects on the integrity of the coastal ecosystem and the livelihoods of certain groups of local residents; a rich common property resource is converted into a privately-owned system of cultivation. While benefits accrue to those with access to the capital necessary for the construction of fishponds, the costs of development are borne largely by mangrove gatherers and artisanal fisherfolk, whose share of a diminishing resource base is steadily declining. For these marginal groups, aquaculture is shown to provide few compensating economic benefits. The study supports, through concrete local evidence, the criticisms made of orthodox approaches to development, and the need to construct attitudes and strategies which are more attuned to local sustainability and equity.</description><creator>Kelly, Philip F.

The lithofacies of the Cooking Lake Formation platform are assigned to eight depositional environments: (1) deep subtidal argillaceous calcimudstones, (2) deep to shallow subtidal nodular wackestones, (3) intermediate subtidal skeletal lime wackestones, (4) intertidal stromatoporoid/coral floatstones to rudstones, (5) shallow subtidal to lagoonal Amphipora floatstones, (6) shallow-shoal grainstones, (7) semi-restricted shallow subtidal peloidal wackestones/packstones, and (8) upper intertidal to supratidal laminated grainstones to algal-laminated limestones. Near-surface diagenesis is characterized by rim, syntaxial, equant and blocky calcite cements. During shallow-burial diagenesis, replacement dolomite and compaction features such as stylolites and dissolution seams developed. Intermediate to late-burial diagenesis is characterized by anhydrite, coarse-crystalline and saddle dolomite cements and late, coarse-crystalline calcite cements. Replacement dolomite and later dolomite cements occur across the entire platform but it is less important in the more muddy middle member. Petrographic and stable isotope data suggest that replacement dolomite formed during shallow-burial diagenesis associated with compaction features. Massive replacement dolomite only occur close to the dolomitized Rimbey-Meadowbrook reef trend. The highest porosity (interparticle) occurs in the peloidal grainstone facies. Submarine equant and blocky calcite cements appear to be the most abundant cement whereas replacement dolomitization, dissolution, and fracturing slightly increased porosity, except in the massively dolomitized facies. The western part of the platform, which is massively dolomitized, may have served as an aquifer for the dolomitizing fluids.</description><creator>Chouinard, Hugo</creator><contributor>Mountjoy, Eric (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Geology.</subject><title>Lithofacies and diagenesis of the Cooking Lake platform : carbonates, Alberta Basin subsurface, Canada</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hm50ts42p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pg15bf83m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:41687j31f</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:32:42Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Particle behaviour during the downwards, pneumatic injection of powder into an aqueous medium (water) has been investigated by means of a new method which involves direct measurement by making use of an Aqueous Particle Sensor (APS) unit. Through this method, phenomena and parameters related to injection processes, such as gas-particle jet penetration distance, jet diameter, jet cone angle, particle dispersion and distribution within the liquid have been investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively. Flow observations comprised part of the experimental program for the purpose of confirming the characteristics of the "gas-only" and "gas-powder" injection regimes reported by previous workers. The effect of gas and powder flow rates (powder/gas loading ratio) in determining the injection regimes and particle behaviour within the liquid were the main parameters investigated. It was demonstrated that the jetting regime can be easily achieved as a result of increased momentum transfer from the particles to the gas phase. However, this required a high loading of particles. Entrainment of gas with the injected particles took place not only during coupled flow (jetting) but also during decoupled (bubbling) flow, such that some gas was always entrained by the particles and penetrated the liquid as a gas-particle jet, leaving large gas bubbles at the lance tip. It was further demonstrated that the gas flow rate had a greater effect on particle suspension within the liquid than did the powder flow rate.</description><creator>Yamanoglu, Güller</creator><contributor>Guthrie, R.

Although a student of Heidegger's at Freiburg between 1936 and 1939, Nishitani shows no evidence of a heideggerian influence in The Self-Overcoming of Nihilism. In this period (1949), he considers, contrary to Heidegger, that the affirmative aspects of nietzschean philosophy constitute a radical overcoming of nihilism. It is only in What is Religion? (1961) which appears in 1982 as Religion and Nothingness (English translation) that his view changes, reflecting more closely a heideggerian position. Nietzsche's concept of the Will to Power is evidence for Nishitani that Nietzsche enmeshed still in a philosophy of "Being", remains within traditional Western metaphysics. Because in Nishitani's view, Western metaphysics is nihilist, he finally concludes that Nietzsche did not overcome nihilism. This development in Nishitani's thought is considered, in a concluding perspective of the present text, as evidence of the markedly more profound influence of Heidegger on the later, more mature work of Nishitani.</description><creator>Gingras, Gisèle</creator><contributor>Boutin, Maurice (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Nihilism (Philosophy)</subject><subject>Nishitani, Keiji, 1900- -- Contributions in concept of nihilism</subject><subject>Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm, 1844-1900 -- Contributions in concept of nihilism</subject><title>Le nihilisme nietzschéen dans la philosophie de la religion de Nishitani Keiji /</title><language>fre</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vt150k099.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/bz60cx17j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Arts</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Faculty of Religious Studies</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:79407z09r</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:32:43Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Cell adhesion molecules are known to play crucial roles in a variety of developmental processes. The neural cell adhesion molecule N-CAM is strongly implicated in neurulation and neural crest cell (NCC) migration and was thus studied in splotch (Sp) neural tube defect mutant embryos. At the 20 somite-stage of gestation day 9, Sp N-CAM was found to contain polysialic acid (PSA) side chains which are normally only present beginning at gestational day 11. Younger embryos at 12 and 14 somites also showed the presence of PSA on N-CAM, which was absent in controls. Enzymatic removal of PSA from N-CAM resulted in isoforms which migrated identically to PSA-free N-CAM isoforms in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The post-translational modification of N-CAM appears to be the primary target of the Sp gene. In view of N-CAM's importance during development, an alteration at a critical stage is likely to result in the cascade of abnormalities seen in Sp mutants. A new genotyping assay was also implemented for examination of N-CAM in Sp and other related wildtype strains.</description><creator>Neale, Sondra-Ann</creator><contributor>Trasler, D. G.

Depending on the net relfectivity and absorptivity of the haze column and on the surface albedo, the net effect could be a cooling or a warming. But better understanding of the influence of aerosols is handicapped by lack of data and by the fact that their composition and distribution is highly variable in space and time. For the same reasons, the incorporation of aerosols in climate models is usually rudimentary. We have in-situ measurements of the vertical profile and size distribution of aerosols ($&gt;$0.09 $ mu$m in radius) taken over several places in eastern Canada at different times of the year. These data have been incorporated in a simple multi-layer radiative transfer model to estimate the effects of aerosols on the local radiation budget. A broad range of refractive indexes has been used and the increase of the particles size with the relative humidity is included.</description><creator>Moreau, Louis</creator><contributor>Leighton, Henry L.

FSL is a functions-with-state language, meaning that in addition to the usual numerical operations, the user can declare and use functions that can have states, much like sequential boolean circuits, or objects in object-oriented programming. Despite this feature, FSL's input is entirely in the form of equations with a minimum of additional syntax. A users' manual for FSL and some examples of the problems it was applied to introduce the language and its uses. The design of the FSL language is discussed, and then an overview of the implementation of the interactive FSL interpreter is given, followed by complete details, suitably organized and indexed for maintenance and continuation of the project. A full tutorial of the CASE tools Lex and Yacc is included, detailing the specific example of FSL and the interaction of the tools in the design of a parser.</description><creator>Pidcock, Andrew H.</creator><contributor>Merrett, T.

Our purpose is to study the underlying principles that support this patriarchal order and examine the mechanisms that perpetuate it and repress the potential for change. The objective is then to analyze the main female characters since they constitute a subversive presence which is constantly challenging the patriarchal order and which is potentially capable of transforming it. Our goal is also to demonstrate that the writing of the female characters undermine patriarchal discourse. Our final objective is to examine the novel in the context of two "histories": the consecrated male history which is deconstructed here and the extra-official or alternative one that tradition silences and that is represented here by the writing of the female characters.</description><creator>Manrique, Nelly</creator><contributor>Martinez, Z.

The central idea that governs Maxine Hong Kingston's The Woman Warrior, Smaro Kamboureli's in the second person, and Minnie Bruce Pratt's "Identity: Skin Blood Heart," is this: life-writing cannot be divorced from dialogical relations because living cannot be divorced from dialogical relations. Accordingly, if it is impossible to conceive and define ourselves without reference to other selves, it must be equally impossible to write our life-stories without reference to others. Hence, the process of "self-invention" or "self-fashioning" typically associated with the autobiographical project must be reconsidered within the larger frame of history and heritage, community and collaboration.</description><creator>Marinos, Angela</creator><contributor>Bristol, Michael D.

Although this gene was expressed in E. coli at several temperatures, efficient normal xylanase secretion did not occur, the observed protein release apparently depending on cell leakage or lysis. Screening for a better microbial protein secretor free of cellulase selected B. cereus #259. The strain had wild plasmids that were hard to eliminate using acridine orange and elevated temperature curing techniques. While still bearing 5 wild plasmids, attempts to transform B. cereus #259 were unsuccessful using conventional methods and electroporation. Another strain, B. cereus #518, found to be free of wild plasmids, was then used. A bidirectional vector shuttle plasmid (pMK3) was employed to carry the cloned gene into this B. cereus strain. Transformation was carried out by high voltage electroporation. Xylanase production by the new B. cereus clone was similar to that from E. coli, but was shown to be continuously and normally secreted. The xylanase gene products from the E. coli and B. cereus hosts were shown to function identically. Both xylanases improved the delignification of unbleached softwood and hardwood kraft pulps, thus reducing the Cl$ sb2$ required to achieve a given degree of bleaching, without altering the physical properties of the fibers. Using a target kappa number lignin content) of 5, xylanase pretreatment of aspen kraft pulp led to a 22% saving of chlorine. Adsorbable organic halogens in the bleachery effluent were also lowered by more than 50%.</description><creator>Tremblay, Louis</creator><contributor>Archibald, Fred (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Sulfate pulping process.</subject><subject>Bacillus cereus.</subject><subject>Escherichia coli.</subject><subject>Xylanases.</subject><title>Production of a cloned xylanase gene in Bacillus cereus and its performance in kraft pulp prebleaching</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/rr171z02v.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/br86b4266</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gf06g3520</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:32:45Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The fusion (F) protein of measles virus is responsible for viral penetration at the plasma membrane and syncytia formation. In order to facilitate future structure/function studies, the F protein was expressed in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus, and in mammalian cells using both vaccinia and adenovirus recombinants. The baculovirus system exhibited the highest levels of recombinant protein expression, but the majority of the product was found to be in the form of detergent-insoluble precursors. Replacing the signal peptide of the F protein with insect-derived sequences did not enhance posttranslational processing. Also, expression of truncated, anchor-minus forms of the F protein did not result in improved solubility or secretion. The vaccinia virus recombinant VF exhibited higher levels of expression than measles virus-infected cells. However, the majority of the F protein was expressed as insoluble precursors. The biologically active portion, represented by the proteolytically cleaved F protein, was found to be soluble. The vP455 vaccinia virus recombinant and the AdF adenovirus recombinant expressed similar levels of processed F as in measles virus-infected cells. The products of these recombinants were found to be soluble. F protein expressed by vaccinia virus recombinants in primate and murine cells were observed to cause syncytia formation in the absence of measles virus hemagglutinin (H) co-expression. This H-independent fusion could not be inhibited by Z-D-Phe-L-Phe-Gly. When the adenovirus system was used, F protein could not facilitate fusion unless measles virus hemagglutinin was present as well.</description><creator>Tam, John.</creator><contributor>Richardson, Chris (Supervisor)</contributor><date>1993</date><subject>Health Sciences, Immunology.</subject><subject>Biology, Molecular.</subject><subject>Biology, Microbiology.</subject><title>Expression of the membrane fusion protein of measles virus in insect and mammalian cells using recombinant viruses</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/3484zh62p.pdf</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gf06g3520</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Microbiology and Immunology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qv33rx50r</identifier><datestamp>2020-04-06T21:32:46Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Results of numerical simulation of two-dimensional flow field and heat transfer impingement due to laminar and turbulent single as well as multiple slot jets discharging normally into a confined channel are presented. Both low-Reynolds and high-Reynolds number versions of $k - epsilon$ models were used to model the turbulent jet flow. A control volume-based finite difference method was employed to solve the governing mass, momentum, turbulent kinetic energy, turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate and energy equations in the turbulent impinging jet cases. A separate program was written based on a body-fitted coordinate system to predict the transport characteristics of multiple laminar jets impinging on a plate surface with an inclined upper confinement surface. The parameters studied include: the jet Reynolds number, nozzle-to-impingement surface spacing and for the inclined confinement surface cases, the angle of inclination of the upper surface. From the low-Reynolds number model studied it was found that models presented by Lam-Bremhorst and Launder-Sharma to be applicable to single turbulent jet impingement heat transfer predictions. Inclination of the confined surface so as to accelerate the exhaust flow was found to level the Nusselt number distribution on the impingement surface.</description><creator>Seyedein, Seyed Hossein</creator><contributor>Mujumdar, A.
