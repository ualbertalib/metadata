Parison formation is the most critical stage in  the process, as the dimensions of the blow-molded part are directly related to the  dimensions of the parison. In this work, a 'soft sensor' for cycle-to-cycle control of  parison length is developed. A model for parison swell is proposed where the  parameters of the model can be tuned from cycle to cycle to match the experimental  parison dimensions. The technique was tested on a real intermittent extrusion blow  molding machine where a target parison length was achieved by either adjusting the  flow rate of the polymer or the die gap opening. In this work, we have also proposed a technique for estimation  of the average relaxation time using a combination of Carreau and Maxwell models.  This technique is based on the observed time for parison swell outside the die, and  it finds a relaxation time that closely represents the polydisperse nature of blow  molding grade resins. The technique could be extended to estimate multiple  relaxation times using a generalized Maxwell model.

The complexity of digital circuits increases  rapidly, which in turn results in an increased complexity of the verification  process and increased user effort. Efficient and easy to use tools are therefore  required for timed verification. In this thesis we propose two methods to aid the verification  process. Firstly, we introduce a new verification methodology that combines the  advantages of several existing successful approaches. In particular, our  verification technique uses a combination of untimed, relative timing and timed  verification. Secondly, we propose and evaluate a novel method of solving CSPs  (constraint satisfaction problems) using BDDs (binary decision diagrams). We  investigate two different implementations of a BDD-based CSP solver and their  capacity to bridge the gap between untimed and timed verification. Finally, we  present two case studies to demonstrate the proposed techniques.</description><creator>Shapiro, Albina</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Interface timing verification using constraint logic programming and binary decision diagrams</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/th83kz897.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rj4305363</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:rv042t591</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:31Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Structural forensic engineering is a topic that has  traditionally been approached in a deterministic manner. This thesis explores the  use of probabilistic procedures as a tool to obtain more objective and realistic  results in forensic investigations. The first goal of the thesis is the  identification of the most probable cause of a structural failure using  probabilistic procedures. The second goal is to develop a procedure to qualify  forensic engineers and experts according to their qualifications. In the first part, the basic qualifications required for a  forensic engineer or expert are compiled in a checklist and attributed individual  scores, the sum of which qualifies a candidate to act as a forensic engineer or  expert. The proposed qualification and scoring checklist is then validated through a  survey conducted among professionals with forensic engineering  exposures. The second part quantifies failure modes in terms of their  likelihood. The proposed methodology uses a-priori failure probabilities from  historic data, elicits forensic engineering experts for subjective failure  probabilities, calculates the updated posterior failure probabilities, and  identifies the failure cause corresponding to the highest posterior probability as  the most plausible cause of failure. The proposed methodology is supported by a thorough literature  review of forensic engineering procedures, a classification of structural failure  causes, and expert opinion elicitation and aggregation methods.</description><creator>Saliba, Nabil E.</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Engineering, Civil.</subject><title>A quantitative approach to structural forensic engineering /</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/j6731451k.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/rv042t591</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:qv33rx22k</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The complex musculoskeletal system of a running animal on  horizontal surfaces act essentially like a simple pogo stick, and can be modeled as  a hopping spring-mass model known as the Spring-loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP)  model. The SLIP model has been extensively used as a reduced-order model in analysis  and control of running legged robots. By contrast, the SLIP model itself has never  been implemented in a robot and validated experimentally. This thesis addresses the  development and validation of a robotic SLIP, a planar one-legged hopping robot with  only one actuator. A feasibility study was performed using numerical simulation. The  experimental platform was designed and built based on SLIP-model features. A hopping  controller that conceptually reproduced the self-stability property of the SLIP  model was implemented. Running was achieved at 6.7 leg lengths per second, which is,  to date, the fastest dimension-less speed for a single-legged robot. Simulation and  experimental data demonstrated periodic and robust stability. The SLIP model was  qualitatively validated for a particular gait in simulation and  experimentation.</description><creator>Sato, Akihiro</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Engineering, Mechanical.</subject><title>A planar hopping robot with one actuator : design, simulation, and experimental results</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/00000055k.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/qv33rx22k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Mechanical Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wd375w86t</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Durability of reinforced concrete infrastructure is severely  affected by corrosion of reinforcing steel. Conventional patch repair techniques are  unable to stop this corrosion due to electrochemical incompatibility between the  "repaired" concrete and the original "chloride-infested"  concrete. This research was undertaken to compare the performance of different patch  repair strategies of corroded concrete bridge deck slabs, proposed by different  industrial partners, with respect to the conventional patch repair. The results show that the potential difference between the  "repaired-patch" concrete and the "existing" concrete  accelerates local corrosion around the patch, and gradually progresses towards the  repaired zone. Beneficial effect of sacrificial anodes and corrosion inhibitors in a  KCl and a NaCl environment, are evaluated at the beginning of the repair, however,  their effectiveness decreases with time. Corrosion penetration rate obtained from  Tafel Test, overestimated the actual rebar mass loss, indicating the need for more  research in this area. It is recommended that for new construction, concrete must have  low diffusivity to avoid premature deterioration, and for repair, electrochemical  protection systems such as cathodic protection, embedded sacrificial anode,  corrosion inhibitor, and chloride extraction should be considered to increase the  service life of the repaired system. Surface coatings such as zinc, epoxy, sealer or  membrane can be used as additional line of defence. In addition, the existing cracks  must be treated, and the bridge deck drainage system and expansion joints must be  designed properly to avoid ingress of chloride-contaminated water into the concrete.</description><creator>Saifuzzaman, Mohammad</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Civil.</subject><title>Performance of patch-repair of corroded concrete deck slabs</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/m613mz09x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wd375w86t</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:6h440s95h</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:32Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Audio coding paradigms depend on time-frequency transformations  to remove statistical redundancy in audio signals and reduce data bit rate, while  maintaining high fidelity of the reconstructed signal. Sophisticated perceptual  audio coding further exploits perceptual redundancy in audio signals by  incorporating perceptual masking phenomena. This thesis focuses on the investigation  of different coding transformations that can be used to compute perceptual  distortion measures effectively; among them the lapped transform, which is most  widely used in nowadays audio coders. Moreover, an innovative lapped transform is  developed that can vary overlap percentage at arbitrary degrees. The new lapped  transform is applicable on the transient audio by capturing the time-varying  characteristics of the signal.</description><creator>Ruan, Sien</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Electronics and Electrical.</subject><title>Lapped transforms in perceptual coding of wideband audio</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/hq37vp12g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/6h440s95h</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:dr26xx804</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The catalytic oxidation of bisphenol A (BPA) by laccase (EC  1.10.3.2) has recently attracted considerable attention because laccase can rapidly  transform potentially persistent and toxic pollutants such as bisphenol A in the  presence of molecular oxygen. Direct treatment of wastewaters containing bisphenol A  would require excessive amounts of laccase if the enzyme is lost with the effluent  and, thus, treatment would be cost-prohibitive. Therefore, strategies are desired  for retaining the enzyme in the treatment system. It was envisioned that this could  be accomplished by extracting pollutants into a non-aqueous phase liquid and then  treating them in that phase using enzymatic catalysis. In such a treatment scheme,  preserving the enzyme and maintaining its high reactivity in a non-aqueous phase  liquid can be easily achieved through the use of reverse micelles. Therefore, this study was conducted in order to examine the  efficiency of enzymatic treatment of BPA in reverse micelles. It was found that  laccase entrapped in the reverse micelles formed by dioctyl sulfosuccinate sodium  salt (AOT) and isooctane exhibited the highest catalytic activity at a pH of 6, a  water content of 10 (i.e., the molar ratio of water to AOT), and an AOT  concentration of 80 mM.</description><creator>Liu, Yan, 1975-</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Environmental Sciences.</subject><title>Laccase-catalyzed oxidation of bisphenol A in a non-aqueous liquid reverse micelles</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/0g354f808.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/dr26xx804</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:dr26xx81d</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:33Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>In all-photonic networks, both transmission and switching is  performed in the optical domain, without optoelectronic conversion for the data  traversing the network. An accurate traffic model is critical in an agile  all-photonic network (AAPN) which has the ability to dynamically allocate bandwidth  to traffic flows as the demand varies. This thesis focuses on traffic modelling and analysis. A novel  traffic model is proposed which can capture the traffic behaviours in all-photonic  networks. The new model is based on a study of existing traffic modelling  literature. It combines the time-varying Poisson model, gravity model and fractional  Gaussian noise. This model can be used for the short-range traffic prediction.

This experimental program was primarily  undertaken to examine the corrosion process in reinforced concrete repair, which has  different characteristics as compared with corrosion in new construction. The  program was designed to gain a deeper understanding of how certain restoration  strategies may lead to problems of electrochemical incompatibility and result in  ineffective corrosion mitigation. Fifteen specimens, 1m by 1m by 0.2m, were cast to represent a  section of a deteriorating reinforced concrete bridge deck slab. The central portion  was uniquely designed to simulate the deterioration caused by corrosion activity in  a bridge deck slab. After initiating corrosion using wetting and drying cycles with  15% salt solution, each specimen was subjected to a unique restoration strategy. The  wetting and drying cycles continued, and a monitoring program was established to  observe the corrosion activity of each specimen. The results corroborate current research, that patch repairs can  trigger the formation of a macrocell corrosion cell, or a ring of active corrosion  surrounding the repaired zone. In addition, the results from the electrochemical  testing revealed sharp differences in the corrosion behaviour of the different  restoration strategies. However, the physical evidence of minimal corrosion for all  four specimens that were demolished at the end of the testing period, reveals a  discrepancy with the electrochemical testing results.</description><creator>Leyne, Eileen</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Engineering, Civil.</subject><title>Corrosion in reinforced concrete repair</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/8049g5656.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/m039k549k</identifier><degree><name>Master of Engineering</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:sf268568s</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:34Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>All-Optical networks have been proposed as a solution to meet  growing demand for broadband access. An essential component in these networks will  be new Clock and Data Recovery devices which can recover burst-mode traffic. This a  significantly different challenge from conventional, continuous-mode CDR. Burst-mode  data originates at various sources and arrives at the receiver with different  phases, potentially changing by +/-pi Rads. Therefore, new CDR designs are required  to adapt to large steps in phase upon each new burst to maintain BER integrity. This  must be accomplished on the order of ns if All-Optical networks are to be viable.  While several such designs have been proposed, a clear solution has yet to emerge.

Measurements of the radiant intensity at several narrow  wavelength bands are used to estimate the temperature of the products within the  fireball.

The output of frequency synthesizers may be used  as the local oscillator signal in superheterodyne transceivers, or in frequency  modulation/demodulation. Fully integrated CMOS RF synthesizers are currently a major  research topic. Several publications demonstrated improvements in a variety of  aspects such as phase noise, power consumption, and tuning range. However, very low  voltage frequency synthesizers are very challenging, since they usually have a  limited tuning range and a relatively high phase noise. This research work  demonstrates a new architecture to achieve a wide tuning range and low phase noise  from a very low voltage supply. The synthesizer is fully integrated in a 0.18 mum  CMOS technology covering the 5 GHz WLAN frequency range, requiring only a 1-V power  supply.

Consequently, maintaining a good mesh quality becomes very important in the  unstructured mesh. In order to achieve high quality meshes, a number of mesh  smoothing techniques have been used. Most of these techniques are able to improve  the mesh quality effectively. In this research, the Laplacian smoothing algorithm,  combined with two complementary methods, is investigated. However, one of the problems with mesh smoothing techniques is  to maintain an efficient compute time especially in some large-scale applications.  Thus, parallel computing is used in order to speed up execution time. The shared  memory model, one of the two parallel computing models, is studied in this work.

Thus, a study has  been conducted that identifies the atmospheric circulation patterns associated with  extreme lightning events. In addition, events are stratified according to the number  of resultant large wildfires to determine why some extreme lightning events induce a  large quantity of wildfires within the basin, and why others do not. Extreme lightning events in the MRB are characterized by a  strong, persistent upper-tropospheric ridge dominating the basin until event onset.  The triggering mechanism of the majority of extreme lightning events is cyclogenesis  in lee of the Rocky and Mackenzie Mountains. A Haines Index analysis has been used  to show that lack of lower-tropospheric moisture and ample lower-tropospheric  instability in advance of an extreme lightning event increase the probability of  several resultant large wildfires. Furthermore, extreme lightning events with  several induced large wildfires are characterized by a lack of moisture transport  into the MRB from the northeast Pacific Ocean.</description><creator>Way, Andrew Michael</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Physics, Atmospheric Science.</subject><title>Atmospheric circulation patterns of extreme lightning events and associated wildfires in the Mackenzie Riber Basin</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/jw827c28m.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/pn89d7067</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:nk322d92z</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:36Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is an enzyme  involved in homocysteine metabolism. A common polymorphism in the MTHFR gene  (677C→T) can result in the condition hyperhomocysteinemia when concurrent  with low dietary folate intake. In several clinical studies, this polymorphism has  been associated with low bone mineral density and increased fracture  risk. The MTHFR knockout mouse, a model for human  hyperhomocysteinemia, was used to further investigate the bone phenotype associated  with this condition by comparing heterozygous mutants to wild-type animals. Effects  of a low folate diet were also assessed. Bone strength was not decreased, and osteoclast numbers were not  increased in heterozygotes or due to low folate. Expression levels of several genes  involved in protection against oxidative stress were altered in heterozygotes as  compared to wild-types. Bone mineral density was decreased and bone architecture  changed as a result of low folate intake, especially in heterozygotes. These  findings shed light on possible mechanisms of homocysteine toxicity in  bone.</description><creator>Wikholm, Eva</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Biology, Genetics.</subject><title>Assessment of the impact of hyperhomocysteinemia on bone using the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase-deficient mouse model</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/vh53ww35s.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/nk322d92z</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Human Genetics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:t722h942r</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:36Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Thalassemia is a blood disorder requiring lifelong transfusions  for survival. Erythrocytes accumulate toxic iron at their membranes, triggering an  oxidative cascade that leads to their premature destruction. We hypothesized that  removing this proximate iron compartment as a primary treatment using novel iron  chelators, could prevent hastened red cell removal and clinically alleviate the need  for transfusion. Novel, highly cell permeable iron chelators, pyridoxal  isonicotinoyl hydrazone (PIH) and pyridoxal ortho-chlorobenzoyl hydrazone (o-108)  were compared to the present mainstay, desferrioxamine (DFO) and deferiprone (L1),  in vitro and in vivo . Treatment of human model beta-thalassemic erythrocytes with  chelators resulted in significant depletion of membrane-associated iron and reduced  oxidative stress as indicated by a decrease in methemoglobin levels. When  administered to beta-thalassemic mice, iron chelators mobilized erythrocyte membrane  iron, reduced cellular oxidation, and prolonged erythrocyte survival. Consistently,  these mice showed improved hematological abnormalities. A beneficial effect as early  as the erythroid precursor stage was also determined by normalized proportions of  mature versus immature reticulocytes. Remarkably, all four chelators reduced iron  accumulation in target organs. Most importantly, o-108 revealed superior activity,  decreasing iron in liver and spleen by ~5-fold and ~2-fold,  respectively, compared to DFO. Our study demonstrates that iron chelators ameliorate  thalassemia in a human and murine model, and validates their primary use as an  alternative to transfusion therapy.</description><creator>Szuber, Natasha</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Biology, Animal Physiology.</subject><title>Iron chelators improve the pathophysiology of [beta]-thalassemia in vitro and in vivo</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/5712m716g.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/t722h942r</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Physiology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:0v838113m</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Human telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex, minimally  composed of a catalytic subunit, hTERT and an RNA component, hTR that contains the  template used to synthesize telomere DNA. Telomerase is present in over 80% of all  cancer cells. Therefore, an understanding of telomerase regulation is important for  cancer research. This thesis work was focused upon the study of telomerase  regulation by telomerase associated proteins and alternatively spliced hTERT mRNA  variants. Tandem affinity purification (TAP) and immunopurifications with anti-hTERT  antibody were used to visualize potential telomerase associated proteins. No  specific proteins were identified in TAP-hTERT transfected cells. hTERT was purified  from 293 telomerase positive cells, and proteins specifically associated with hTERT  were visualized. Insertion 3 and 4 alternatively spliced hTERT mRNA variants were  detected in telomerase positive cell lines by RT-PCR and Southern blot analysis. The  gamma-deletion alternatively spliced hTERT mRNA variant was detected in Huh-7 liver  cells. These results provide information and tools important for a greater  understanding of telomerase.</description><creator>Taboski, Michael</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>Human telomerase regulation by associated proteins and alternatively spliced mRNA variants</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/s7526c85p.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0v838113m</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:wd375w873</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The meteorite impact that formed the 32-km-diameter Upper  Pennsylvanian (285 +/- 23 Ma) West Clearwater structure, situated about 125 km east  of the Hudson Bay arc, northern Quebec, formed a sheet of impact melt now exposed on  a central ring of islands. At least seven marble enclaves have been mapped in the  melt sheet; this report is based on observations made on samples from two of these  enclaves. These blocks represent recrystallized remnants of a cover of Middle  Ordovician limestone, now completely eroded in the area. While the impact melt was  still above its solidus, the locally fossiliferous dolomite-bearing limestone  recrystallized to granoblastic calcite + periclase marble. The silica content of the  marble led to the formation of a sanidinite-facies assemblage of unusual  nesosilicates such as spurrite, Ca5(SiO4)2(CO3), merwinite, Ca 3Mg(SiO4)2, and  monticellite, CaMgSiO4. Aluminian srebrodolskite, Ca2(Fe3+,Al)2O 5, the  Fe3+-dominant analogue of brownmillerite, Ca 2(Al,Fe3+)2O5, is found in material  with a composition similar to "Portland cement clinker". At its type  locality, srebrodolskite is attributed to the calcining of ankeritic carbonate.  Phase equilibrium and stratigraphic data constrain peak conditions of metamorphism  to at least, T ≈ 815º +/- 15ºC, P &lt; 100 bar and X(CO2)  &gt; 0.1. Retrograde mineral assemblages indicate that X(CO2) &lt; 0.1 was  achieved shortly after peak metamorphism owing to influx of H2O. Portlandite,  Ca(OH)2, is one of several species formed during late hydration of the assemblage upon cooling.</description><creator>Rosa, Daniel F.</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Mineralogy.</subject><title>Marble enclaves in the melt sheet at the West Clearwater Lake Impact crater, northern Quebec</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/2b88qc71j.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/wd375w873</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:5d86p0908</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:37Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>RasGAP-SH3 binding protein (G3BP) is a player in the ras signal  transduction pathway and is involved in mRNA turnover. G3BP is a multifunctional  protein affecting cell growth, cell stress responses, and cell transformation. The  goal of this study was to define ex vivo function(s) of G3BP in several systems. We  developed two RNA interference methods to knockdown G3BP in murine cell lines. We  observed that the partial plasmid-mediated RNAi knockdown of MmuG3BP1 does not  affect muscle cell differentiation. To improve efficiency, we successfully developed  lentiviral-mediated RNAi against MmuG3BP1 resulting in significant knockdown in  NIH-3T3 cells. We also developed vectors for pull-down experiments designed to  identify G3BP1's binding proteins. Furthermore, we generated an efficient polyclonal  anti-GST-G3BP1 antibody. Thus, we developed and tested tools to define the ex vivo  function(s) of G3BP1.</description><creator>Roudaia, Liya</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Chemistry, Biochemistry.</subject><subject>Biology, Cell.</subject><title>Characterization of RasGAP-SH3-binding protein's functions</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/1g05fc120.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/5d86p0908</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Biochemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:ks65hc787</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Objective. To develop predictive models for positive outcomes of  upper and lower endoscopies in children. Methods. Retrospective review of all endoscopies performed from  January to December, 2000 at St. Justine Hospital. Predictive models for positive  outcomes on endoscopy were constructed for upper and lower endoscopies separately  using multiple logistic regression. Results. Age greater than 13 years, hematemesis, epigastric  tenderness and hypoalbuminemia were significant predictors of positive upper  endoscopies. Male sex, age and rectal bleeding were significant predictors of  positive lower endoscopies. Both models were significant at p &lt; 0.0001 yet  their receiver operating curves indicated that a model with sensitivity of 95% had a  specificity of less than 40%. Conclusion. Predictors of positive upper and lower endoscopy  outcomes were found. The predictive models were statistically significant yet their  performance did not reach clinical significance. A prospective, adequately powered  study of predictors for endoscopy outcomes is needed to confirm these  results.</description><creator>Noble, Angela</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Health Sciences, Public Health.</subject><subject>Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.</subject><subject>Biology, Biostatistics.</subject><title>Development of predictive models for positive outcomes of upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopies in children and adolescents</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/t722h9431.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hc787</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:mw22v597b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:38Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>We measure the electron density of a single Landau Level of a  two-dimensional electron system (2DES) in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure cleaved edge  overgrown structure. Edge spectroscopy, which is a powerful technique to probe  correlations in 2D systems, has been used. While the 2DEG shows typical fractional  quantum Hall features from a many-particle behavior (Luttinger Liquid) at low  tunneling voltages, to single particle characteristic at high voltages, which  reflects the absence of a many-body state away from the Fermi level. At high enough  voltages, the single particle characteristic induces an asymmetry when tunneling  into the 2DEG compared to tunneling out of it, which can be understood in the  context of the single particle Landau level spectral distribution at the edge. We  measure the complete current-voltage characteristics for tunneling between 2DEG and  3D edge at zero magnetic field.

Water was run through  the coil centrally located inside the oven cavity for microwave heating. Microwave  absorption efficiency was evaluated by measuring inlet and outlet temperatures of  coil as a function of system variables. In order to optimize the coil configuration,  the influence of tube diameter (6.4, 7.9 and 9.7mm); initial temperature (10, 20 and  30 ºC); number of turns (3.5, 4.5 and 5.5); coil diameter (61.5, 88, 102,  121 and 153 mm) and pitch (16, 18, 20, 22 and 24mm) were evaluated, respectively at  different flow rates (240, 270, 300, 330 and 360ml/min). In helical systems, Dean  number is used as a measure of secondary flow which enhances mixing of the fluid  providing uniform heating even under laminar flow conditions. Results showed that  microwave absorption efficiency was a compromise between coil volume and Dean  number. Therefore, a helical coil (110 mm high) with a coil diameter of 108 mm, tube  diameter of 8.2 mm, 5.5 turns demonstrated the highest efficiency, fast heating  rate, more uniform heating and less temperature fluctuations. The optimized coil  configuration parameters were used subsequently to set up continuous-flow microwave  heating system.</description><creator>Lin, Man Guang, 1966-</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Microwave heating.</subject><subject>Alkaline phosphatase.</subject><subject>Milk -- Pasteurization.</subject><title>Continuous flow microwave heating : evaluation of system efficiency and enzyme inactivation kinetics</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/pc289j54x.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ks65hc81j</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:gt54kn67f</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>The importance of root systems for soil-based resource  acquisition by plants has long motivated researchers to quantify the complexity of  root system structures. However, most of those studies proceeded from 2-D spatial  data, and thus lacked the relevance of a 3-D analysis. In this project, helical CT  scanning was applied to study root systems with an unprecedented level of accuracy,  using non-destructive and non-invasive 3-D imaging that allowed for a  spatio-temporal analysis. The appropriate CT scan parameters and configuration were  determined for root systems of maize seedlings grown in sand and loamy sand. It was  found that the soil conditions allowing for better visualization were sand before  watering and loamy sand after watering. Root systems were CT scanned and visualized  either at a single moment in time or repeatedly on successive days. Complexity  analysis was performed by estimating the fractal dimension on skeletonized 3-D  images of root systems.</description><creator>Lontoc-Roy, Melinda</creator><date>2005</date><subject>Spiral computed tomography.</subject><subject>Corn -- Roots -- Anatomy.</subject><subject>Roots (Botany) -- Anatomy.</subject><subject>Three-dimensional imaging in biology.</subject><title>Three-dimensional visualization in situ and complexity analysis of crop root systems using CT scan data : a primer</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dj52w531t.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/gt54kn67f</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Plant Science</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:kh04dq21b</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:39Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Climate change and warming have been linked to enhanced coastal  erosion in the arctic. Specifically, permafrost is believed to be thawing at greater  rates, and wave dynamics are expected to increase in intensity. As a result,  thermokarst activity, which includes the occurrence of retrogressive thaw slumps,  will be more frequent along arctic coasts. The availability of airborne and spaceborne imagery in the  arctic over the last fifty years has made possible the temporal analysis of  permafrost and ground ice-related erosion. The objectives of this thesis are (1) the  creation of a large scale database for horizontal coastal retreat on Herschel Island  for the 1952-2000 timespan, (2) the investigation of retrogressive thaw slump  activity over the same period and its relation to coastal erosion, and (3) the  elaboration of stereophotogrammetric techniques to investigate retrogressive thaw  slump activity volumetrically. Herschel Island, located on the northern coast of the  Yukon Territory, was chosen as the study site for this research, because of the  widespread presence of retrogressive thaw slumps and the lack of data for coastal  erosion during the last fifty years. Photogrammetric tools were used to create orthorectified and  stereo-images of the Island for the years 1952, 1970, 2000 and 2004 from airphoto  archives and Ikonos (1 m resolution) imagery. Coastal erosion was found to be stable  or declining on Herschel Island except in the vicinity of retrogressive thaw slumps.  In addition, retrogressive thaw slumps were identified on the imagery and observed  to have increased in frequency for the 1952-2000 period. Stereophotogrammetric analysis of two retrogressive thaw slumps  showed that eroded sediment volumes from these landforms are considerable and should  be included in future assessments of sediment release from arctic coasts to the  oceanic shelves.</description><creator>Lantuit, Hugues</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Erosion -- Yukon -- Herschel Island.</subject><subject>Coast changes -- Yukon -- Herschel Island</subject><subject>Frozen ground -- Yukon -- Herschel Island.</subject><title>Mapping permafrost and ground-ice related coastal erosion on Herschel Island, southern Beaufort Sea, Yukon Territory, Canada</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/ws859g216.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/kh04dq21b</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Geography</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:escholarship.mcgill.ca:1n79h4983</identifier><datestamp>2020-03-23T04:51:40Z</datestamp></header><metadata><thesis xmlns="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/ http://www.ndltd.org/standards/metadata/etdms/1-0/etdms.xsd"><description>Alkylation of carbonyl compounds with diorganozinc, organozinc  halides and organoaluminium reagents has been conducted in ionic liquids. Systems  studied included solvents such as N-butylpyridinium tetrafluoroborate,  1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate and 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium  tetrafluoroborate. Interestingly, reactivities of organometallics towards ionic  liquids were revealed, yielding the imidazolylidene zinc complex formation in the  case of alkylation with diethylzinc. Thus, different ways of ionic liquid  preparations and purification methods were studied. The reaction between diethylzinc  and aldehyde proceeded cleanly with high yield. This is in contrast to the reaction  in aqueous media where diethylzinc is hydrolyzed readily, or in conventional  volatile organic solvents where the addition of diethylzinc to aldehyde is generally  sluggish and gives a low yield. Generation of organozinc reagents in situ in carrying out other  zinc mediated alkylation reactions has also been attempted. Preliminary success of  the in situ preparation of ethylzinc and isopropylzinc halide has been achieved in  ionic liquid. Besides, we have demonstrated that the trialkylaluminium  reagents could be used to alkylate carbonyl compounds giving dimethylaluminium  alkoxides as the major reaction products. And it is believed that triorganoaluminium  reagents react with carbonyl compounds in both solventless and ionic liquid  conditions involving the first order four-center transition state.</description><creator>Law, Man Chun, 1979-</creator><date>2004</date><subject>Chemistry, Organic.</subject><title>Organometallic reaction in ionic liquids : alkylation of carbonyl compounds with organozinc and organoaluminum reagents</title><language>eng</language><publisher>McGill University</publisher><type>Thesis</type><rights>All items in eScholarship@McGill are protected by copyright with all rights reserved unless otherwise indicated.</rights><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/downloads/dn39x195p.PDF</identifier><identifier>https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/1n79h4983</identifier><degree><name>Master of Science</name><grantor>McGill University</grantor><discipline>Department of Chemistry</discipline></degree></thesis></metadata></record><resumptionToken completeListSize="47894">oai_etdms.s(Collection:theses).f(2019-10-16T06:03:34Z).u(2020-07-23T18:55:55Z).t(47894):35375</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
