<dc:description>A descriptive case study approach and 34 indicators was used to examine the socio-economic impacts of whale watching tourism in the Laguna San Ignacio (LSI) World Heritage Site - located within the El Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve in Baja California Sur, Mexico. The framework measured both the socio-economic changes, and the economic viability of the local and regional operators. This approach led to a detailed understanding of the underlying, and often complex, inter-related factors that shaped the ecotourism development in LSI between 1994 and 2002. It identified strengths and weaknesses of current ecotourism development making it a valid tool for evaluating and improving these activities in any biosphere reserve. 

More specifically the objectives were to examine:
1. How existing ecotourism operations and their activities in the LSI have changed since 1994;
2. Whether these changes have made ecotourism a more viable socio-economic development alternative for the local communities; and
3. Which strategies may be useful in overcoming identified barriers to further socio-economic benefits both from existing and future ecotourism activities.

The results strongly suggested that the benefits from ecotourism improved significantly between 1994 and 2002. Economically this was reflected in growth of visitor numbers (50%), employment (100%) and local and regional revenue approximately 70% (or 55% in real terms adjusting for inflation). Social benefits were seen in more cooperation among previous antagonistic stakeholders; a wider distribution of ecotourism benefits; some improvement in living standards and increasing local support for the Reserve. Politically, local stakeholders became more empowered through involvement in tourism related management activities. The viability of the local and regional operators also improved significantly as they became more sophisticated in their product offerings, enhanced their facilities and gained a market share of ecotourism relative to the foreign operators. These improvements were particular true for the operators that sold package tours. However, the analyses also revealed a number of barriers with the most important ones being:

• Unresolved historic land use conflicts over rights to land with ecotourism possibilities;

• Lack of activities diversification possibilities outside the tourism season;

• Stagnating visitor numbers;

• Uneven business skills among operators;

• Poor marketing and promotional efforts;

• Insufficient ecotourism infrastructure;

• A proposed ecotourism tax;

• Low profit margin of the ecotourism operators; and

• Lack of funding for further investments

To alleviate these threats and barriers 13 general strategies were identified. An elaboration of these resulted in 39 concrete operational strategies on how potentially to implement them.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The present work introduces a methodology to obtain a discrete time state space representation of an electrical network using the nodal [G] matrix of the Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP) solution. This is the first time the connection between the EMTP nodal analysis solution and a corresponding state-space formulation is presented. Compared to conventional state space solutions, the nodal EMTP solution is computationally much more efficient. Compared to the phasor solutions used in transient stability analysis, the proposed approach captures a much wider range of eigenvalues and system operating states. A fundamental advantage of extracting the system eigenvalues directly from the EMTP solution is the ability of the EMTP to follow the characteristics of nonlinearities. The system's trajectory can be accurately traced and the calculated eigenvalues and eigenvectors correctly represent the system's instantaneous dynamics. In addition, the algorithm can be used as a tool to identify network partitioning subsystems suitable for real-time hybrid power system simulator environments, including the implementation of multi-time scale solutions. The proposed technique can be implemented as an extension to any EMTP-based simulator. Within our UBC research group, it is aimed at extending the capabilities of our real-time PC-cluster
Object Virtual Network Integrator (OVNI) simulator.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Millisecond pulsars (MSP) are old neutron stars that have been spun up to high spin frequencies(as fast as 716 Hz) through the accretion of matter from a companion star. The extreme stellar densities in the core of globular clusters creates numerous accreting neutron star systems through exchange interactions; this leads to the formation of MSPs in larger numbers than in the galactic disk. Over the course of this project, we have collected over 17 TB of data on the 3 globular clusters M28, NGC6440 and NGC6441 plus 2 observations on NGC6522 and NGC6624 as part of the recently begun S-band survey using the Green Bank telescope. I have analyzed and conducted acceleration searches on 70% of the data and discovered 7 of the 23 new millisecond pulsars reported in this work. One year of timing observations of the pulsars in M28 and NGC6440 has led to the phase connected solution for 12 of the 15 new pulsars in those two clusters, 7 of which are in binaries. We have measured the rate of advance of periastron for two highly eccentric binaries and assuming this is
purely due to general relativity, this leads to total system masses of (1.616 - 0.014)M and (2.2 - 0.8)M for M28C and NGC6440B respectively. The small mass function combined with this information imply that the most likely neutron star mass of NGC6440B is either very large or else there could be significant contribution to the advance of periastron from a nonzero quadrupole moment due to tidal interaction with the companion. Measurements of the period derivatives for many of the pulsars show that they are dominated by the dynamical effect of the gravitational field of the clusters. Finally, we have discovered the potential presence of a Mars-mass planet orbiting the pulsar NGC6440C with a period of 21 days. A dedicated timing campaign will be necessary to confirm the presence of such an object.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study analyzes the economic impact of a recent gene marker innovation for seedstock selection in beef cattle. Gene markers are being developed for many beef cattle attributes; this study focused on the tenderness quality of beef using two categories: tender and tough.  The study begins by describing conventional procedures for seedstock selection, the science which underlies selection by gene markers and other non-genetic procedures currently being used to improve beef tenderness. After describing the commercialization of the gene marker innovation, a stylized model of a beef supply chain is constructed. The supply chain consists of a representative consumer, a producer/processor group and a monopolist supplier of the patented technology. Welfare changes resulting from the adoption of the innovation were simulated using four sets of demand elasticity data from literatures.&#xd;
&#xd;
An important focus of this research is determining how the economic surplus from the innovation will be shared by consumers, producers and the gene marker monopolist.  The consumer and gene marker monopolist benefit from the technology unless the marginal and fixed cost variables (not estimated in this study) of the monopolist, are excessively high. Producer surplus was simulated as positive with three of the four elasticity data sets. The share of surplus capture by producers is generally low relative to the gains captured by consumers and the gene marker monopolist. Comparative static analysis reveal that the benefit from the innovation varies across breeds, being higher for breeds in which the favorable form of the marker gene is more likely to be present.&#xd;
Despite the apparent benefits of the innovation for beef supply chain participants, reported interviews with industry scientists reveal that markers should not be viewed as a replacement for conventional selection techniques. Indeed, selecting seedstock on the basis of a small number of available markers is not likely to produce the benefits that are currently being promised by life science companies. Consequently, this study recommends that the innovation be incorporated into existing seedstock selection practices. Much more analysis is needed to understand the full economic impact of gene markers for beef tenderness and for other beef quality attributes.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Pre-equalization for pre-Rake MISO DS-UWB systems</dc:title>

<dc:description>In recent years, ultra-wideband (UWB) communications has gained tremendous
popularity in both research community and industry. The large bandwidth
of UWB systems raises new wireless channel effects and consequently
unique advantages as well as challenges to be dealt with, compared to conventional
wireless systems. One of these advantages is the ability to resolve
dense multipath components and use Rake combining at the receiver in order
to significantly reduce the negative effects of fading. However, implementing
a Rake receiver with a sufficiently large number of fingers to make use
of this advantage is an evident challenge for most UWB devices with limited
signal processing capabilities. A possible approach to overcome this problem
is to move computational complexity from the receiver to the more powerful
transmitter, which is the main focus of the present work.
In this thesis, we propose two novel pre-equalization schemes for multiple-
input single-output (MISO) direct-sequence ultra-wideband (DS-UWB) systems
with pre-Rake combining and symbol-by-symbol detection. The first
pre-equalization filter (PEF) scheme employs one PEF per transmit antenna,
whereas in the second, simplified PEF (S-PEF) scheme all transmit antennas
share the same PEF. For both schemes the optimum finite impulse response
(FIR) and infinite impulse response (IIR) PEFs are calculated based on the
minimum mean squared error (MMSE) criterion. We show that in contrast to
previously proposed schemes for DS-UWB, both our proposed PEF schemes
efficiently exploit the channel shortening properties of the pre-Rake filter. 
In particular, our proposed PEF schemes operate at the symbol level. We also
show that under certain conditions the S-PEF scheme achieves the same performance
as the more complex PEF scheme. Finally, we demonstrate that a
single-input multiple-output (SIMO) DS-UWB system with post-Rake combining
and MMSE post-equalization is the dual system to the considered MISO
DS–UWB system with pre-Rake combining and MMSE pre-equalization. This
uplink-downlink duality can be exploited for efficient calculation of the PEFs
and for complexity reduction.
Our simulation results show that the proposed PEF schemes achieve significant
performance gains over pre-Rake combining without equalization even if only
short PEFs are employed, and this is the case even for long UWB channel
impulse responses.</dc:description>

<dc:title>The role of psychopathy in scholastic cheating:  self-report and objective measures</dc:title>

<dc:subject>psychopathy</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>personality psychology</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>scholastic cheating</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Despite a wealth of studies, no consistent personality predictors of scholastic cheating have been identified.  However, several highly-relevant variables have been overlooked.   I address this void with a series of three studies.  Study 1 was a large-scale survey of a broad range of personality predictors of self-reported scholastic cheating.  The significant predictors were psychopathy, Machiavellianism, narcissism, low Agreeableness and low Conscientiousness.  However, only psychopathy remained significant in a multiple regression.  Study 2 replicated this pattern using a naturalistic, behavioural indicator of cheating -- plagiarism as indexed by the internet service Turn-It-In.  The psychopathy association still held up after controlling for intelligence.  Finally, Study 3 examined possible motivational mediators of the association between psychopathy and cheating.  Unmitigated achievement and moral inhibition were successful mediators whereas fear of punishment was not.  Implications for researchers and educators are discussed.</dc:description>

<dc:title>The analysis of Autographa Californica multiple Nucleopolyhedrovirus EXONO (ORF141) function and its role in virus budding</dc:title>

<dc:description>Baculoviruses have a biphasic replication cycle producing two types of virions, budded virus (BV) and occlusion derived virus (ODV) which are required for the systemic spread or oral infection with the insect host respectively.  Little is known about the events of the BV pathway and the mechanism by which nucleocapsids are selected and directed from the nucleus to plasma membrane to form BV.  The Autographa californica Multiple Nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) gene exon0 (orf141) is known to be required for the efficient production of BV and in this study the function and mechanism by which EXON0 affects BV production was investigated.  

Confocal microscopic analysis showed that EXON0 localized in the nucleus in the ring zone of virogenic stroma where nucleocapsids are assembled.  In addition EXON0 also concentrated in the cytoplasm at the plasma membrane.  Analysis of virions revealed that EXON0 copurified with nucleocapsid fractions of both BV and ODV.  In support of this yeast 2-hybrid screening, co-immunoprecipitation, and confocal microscopy revealed that EXON0 interacted with the known nucleocapsid proteins FP25 and BV/ODV-C42.  Transmission electron microscopy showed that deletion of exon0 results in nucleocapsids being unable to efficiently egress from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

Cellular protein interaction analyzed by tandem affinity purification and co-immunoprecipitation showed that beta-tubulin co-purified with EXON0.  Immunofluorescence also showed that EXON0 and microtubules co-localized during virus infection.  The microtubule inhibitors colchicine and nocodazole affected the localization of EXON0 and significantly reduced BV production.  These data support the conclusion that egress of AcMNPV nucleocapsids is facilitated by interaction of EXON0 with beta-tubulin and microtubules.

Deletion and point mutation analysis mapped domains of EXON0 required for efficient budding, dimer formation and association with FP25, BV/ODV-C42 and beta-tubulin.  The Leucine zipper domain was required for dimer formation, beta-tubulin and BV/ODV-C42 interaction and also reduced interaction with FP25.  Multiple domains were also shown to affect BV production.

This study provides a detailed analysis of EXON0 which is one of the first baculovirus genes shown to be specific for the BV pathway.  The results extend our understanding of the BV pathway which is a major determinant of baculovirus pathogenesis.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The abuse of power, dominance of certain shared perspectives, and reduction of personal values into so-called organizational core values are problems that plague traditional organizational direction setting. The purpose of this study was to explore how power intersects with the knowledge formation process, shared perspectives, and participatory processes within organizational direction setting. 

The study used an ethnographic case study approach to focus on a church that went through a yearlong direction setting process. The church had lost its senior pastor and wanted to determine its direction before hiring a new pastor. The researcher was a participant in that process. His field notes and other documentation provided one source of data. The researcher also interviewed 20 people who participated in the process. 

In terms of the intersection of power and knowledge formation, the study revealed that the discursive practices of the facilitator along with the voices of those in privileged groups, the outspoken, and those who had engendered trust in others carried considerable weight during the process. 

At the intersection of power with shared perspectives, there were two major perspectives representing subgroup cultures: a traditional perspective that resisted change and a progressive perspective that wanted change. The progressives dominated the church’s privileged groups and exerted extensive influence on the direction setting process. The organizational symbols of church staff and worship music style served to galvanize some people in the battle over which perspective would prevail. Transparency functioned as a bridge that brought some on either side of the conflict closer together.

The research revealed two major types of power related to the intersection of power with participatory processes: the power of pain and intimidation. Both minimized the participation of some women, youth, and traditionalists.

All three intersections featured deployments of power that influenced the construction of directional knowledge. This knowledge helped to inform the rules of “appropriate” conduct within the organization’s emerging truth regime.

The study revealed that, in this case, robust directional knowledge would have accommodated personal, subgroup, and widely shared values in a state of dynamic equilibrium.

The researcher concluded with a discussion of implications for organizational leaders.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Representing the planned vs. as-built story for linear projects in urban environment using data visualization</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Zeb, Jehan</dc:creator>
<dc:subject>Construction project data visualization</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Very large sets of multi-source, multi-dimensional and time varying data are generated during the execution of construction projects, especially large-scale infrastructure projects. Emphasized in this thesis is how data visualization can provide important insights during the planning, implementation and post project analysis phases of linear projects in an urban environment, which are attended by a complex working environment and multiple stakeholders. These insights can lead to enhanced communication and better decision making.  
Thesis objectives are four fold: (i) examine how the representation of a schedule using linear planning charts can assist with assessing the quality of a schedule in terms of the construction strategy, communicate schedule intent to projects participants, and assist with telling the as-built story; (ii) explore images useful for representing multi source, multi-dimensional, time varying as-built construction data in support of management functions specifically with regards to communication and decision making; (iii) demonstrate the ability of visual representations of construction data to assist in telling the as-built story of a project in a manner that provides useful insights to project participants; and, (iv) critique the images presented in light of the data visualization principles and interaction tools identified, and suggest improvements as appropriate and possibly other images, including properties desired.
In addressing these objectives, the methodology involved a review of computer science and construction literature as it pertains to data visualization and a case study of a past project which reflected the scale and complexity of planning and executing linear projects in an urban environment. The planned and as-built story were captured from the available data depicting the contractor’s perspective in the project’s product, process, and as-built views which were replicated in a research software system called REPCON software. This system supports selected data visualization capabilities, which were examined and critiqued as part of this thesis.
It is demonstrated that data visualization is a powerful paradigm for gaining insights into the quality of a project’s plan and for understanding a project’s as-built performance. Greater benefits could be achieved by exploiting cutting edge visualization tools and by designing and implementing a more comprehensive set of images.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The investigation and control of molecular properties is currently a dynamic research field. Here I present molecular level studies of porphyrin molecules adsorbed on metal surfaces via Low Temperature Scanning Tunneling Microscopy/Spectroscopy (STM/STS), supported by complementary X-ray absorption experiments. Intermolecular and molecule-surface interactions of tetrapyrdil porphyrin (TPyP) on Ag(111) and Cu(111) were investigated. TPyP self-assembles on Ag(111) over a wide sample temperature range into large, highly-ordered 2D chiral domains. By contrast, adsorption of TPyP on the more reactive Cu(111) leads to temperature dependent assemblies, governed decisively by the strong substrate influence. The increased metal-surface interactions on Cu(111) are accompanied by a conformational distortion of the porphyrin macrocycle. The TPyP’s pyridil groups were coordinated with single iron molecules, forming metal-organic complexes. Furthermore, the porphyrin’s macrocycle was metalated by exposing a layer of well-ordered TPyP to an iron atom beam, demonstrating a novel approach towards the fabrication of metallo-tetraaryl porphyrins performed in two dimensions under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. This method was similarly used to form lanthanideporphyrinates by coordinating tetraphenyl porphyrin (TPP) macrocycles with cerium. The influence of the metal center on the porphyrins’ electronic structure was investigated via STS for TPP, TPyP,Fe−TPyP, Fe−TPP, Ce−TPP, and Co−TPP, whereby the inhomogenous electron density distribution associated with individual frontier orbitals were imaged via dI/dV mapping. The symmetry and form of the molecular orbitals could be directly correlated to the saddle-shaped conformational adaptation for the case of Co −TPP.</dc:description>

<dc:title>The effect of electrical intramuscular stimulation on sub acute and chronic hamstring muscle strain injuries</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Yelizarov, Nikolay</dc:creator>
<dc:subject>electrical intramuscular</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>muscle strain</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Muscle strain injuries affect a wide range of physically active people around the world and are reaching epidemic proportions. Despite the variety of treatment options available in rehabilitation, there are no clear guidelines for electrical stimulation that provide effective reproducible results that address the underlying cause of these injuries. For instance, electrotherapy is inefficient at stimulating muscles, because of imprecise parameters and an ability to target particular muscles.  The difference between this study and previous research is the precise delivery of electrical stimulation (intramuscular) at two different frequencies (2 Hz and 50 Hz) and comparing it a control group.
Objective: To determine the difference on muscle strength and functional status between three treatments modalities for sub acute and chronic hamstring strains.
Design: A randomized experimental design was used to compare the effects of low (2 Hz), high (50 Hz) and no-electrical (control) intramuscular stimulation on muscle strength and mental and functional status (AMSMC HEALTH STATUS INDEX). Each group consisted of 18 subjects.
Main Outcome: The difference in treatment modalities was evaluated by comparing the muscle strength test (Biodex Dynamometer) results and the AMSMC HEALTH STATUS INDEX results in pretest and post-test conditions. 
Results: The AMSMC HEALTH STATUS INDEX, but not muscle strength test (Biodex), changed significantly after 2-Hz electrical intramuscular stimulation (pre-test µ = 66.56, Std= 11.92, post-test µ= 92.89, Std= 6.25), whereas no statistically significant changes in health status index and muscle strength test occurred with 50-Hz (pre-test = 69.22, Std= 11.31, post-test µ= 70.22, Std= 12.27)) and no-electrical stimulation groups (pre-test µ= 69.11, post-test µ= 73.39, Std= 13.18).</dc:description>

<dc:description>The purpose of this study was two-fold: (a) to identify, in a large representative sample of Canadian children, the age-related trajectories of overweight and obesity from toddlerhood into childhood and (b) to investigate the associations between these trajectories and children’s temperaments, their parents’ parenting practices and their interactions. Potentially important familial characteristics (i.e., the parents’ or surrogates’ age, income level, and educational attainment) were considered in the models. 
The sample for this study was drawn from the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY). Group-based mixture modeling analyses were conducted to identify the number and types of distinct trajectories in the development of obesity (i.e., to explicate the developmental processes in the variability of childhood obesity) in a representative sample of children who were between 24 to 35 months of age, at baseline, and followed biennially over a 6-year span. Discriminant analysis was conducted to assess the theoretical notion of goodness-of-fit between parenting practices and children’s temperament, and their association with membership in the BMI trajectory groups. 
The results of the group-based modeling established three different BMI trajectories for the boys, namely: stable-normal BMI, transient-high BMI, and j-curve obesity. The analyses revealed four different trajectories of BMI change for the girls: stable-normal BMI, early-declining BMI, late-declining BMI, and accelerating rise to obesity. 
The multivariate analysis revealed that the combined predictors of the obesity trajectories of the girls (group membership) included having a fussy temperament, ineffective parenting, and parents’ educational attainment. Predictors of the boys’ obesity trajectory (group membership) included household income, parental education, and effective parenting practices. 
Understanding the different ways in which a child may develop obesity will allow nurses and other health professionals to take different approaches in the assessment, intervention and evaluation of obesity and obesity-related health problems. The results of this study further our understanding of factors associated with the development of obesity at a young age and hence may inform the development of early preventive programs.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In this thesis I address two different topics in quantum theory. The first one is the long discussed Schrodinger's cat problem, and the issues related to having a macroscopic superposition state. I show that the quantum theory provides full explanation to the problem. In the second part, I discuss the time measurement related issues in quantum mechanics. Since there does not exist any time operator in quantum mechanics generally, time is not directly measurable. Therefore we should devise other methods to register time. We study different time-energy relations and will find that accurate clocks have high energy uncertainties. If we use accurate clocks in quantum systems to observe their time evolutions, their high energy uncertainties interfere with system's normal evolution and slows it down. I also provide a formal proof to a previously suggested limiting accuracy relation on the measurements of the time-of-arrival experiments.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Stars form from collapsing massive clouds of gas and dust. The UV and optical light emitted by a forming or recently-formed star is absorbed by the surrounding cloud and is re-radiated thermally at infrared and
submillimetre wavelengths. Observations in the submillimetre spectrum are uniquely sensitive to star formation in the early Universe, as the peak of the thermal emission is redshifted to submillimetre wavelengths. The coolest objects in star forming regions in our own Galaxy, including heavily-obscured proto-stars and starless gravitationally-bound clumps, are also uniquely bright in the submillimetre spectrum. The Earth's atmosphere is mostly opaque at these wavelengths, however, limiting the spectral coverage and sensitivity achievable from ground-based observatories. 

The Balloon-borne Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (BLAST) observes the sky from an altitude of 40 km, above 99.5% of the atmosphere, using a long-duration scientific balloon platform. BLAST observes at 3 broad-band wavelengths spanning 250-500 micron, taking advantage of detector technology developed for the space-based
instrument SPIRE, scheduled for launch in 2008. The greatly-enhanced atmospheric transmission at float altitudes, increased detector sensitivity and large number of detector elements allow BLAST to survey much larger fields in a much smaller time than can be accomplished with ground-based instruments. It is expected that in a
single 10-day flight, BLAST will detect ~10000 extragalactic sources, ~100 times the number detected in 10 years of ground-based observations, and 1000s of Galactic star-forming sources, a large fraction of which are not seen by infrared telescopes. 

The instrument has performed 2 scientific flights, in the summer of 2005 and winter of 2006, for a total of 16 days of observing time. This thesis discusses the design of the instrument, performance of the flights, and presents the analysis of 2 of the fields observed during the first flight. A failure in the optical system during the first
flight precluded sensitive extragalactic observations, so the majority of the flight was spent observing Galactic targets. We anticipate exciting extragalactic and Galactic results from the 2006 data.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Fault monitoring in hydraulic systems using unscented Kalman filter</dc:title>

<dc:description>Condition monitoring of hydraulic systems is an area that has grown
substantially in the last few decades. This thesis presents a scheme that
automatically generates the fault symptoms by on-line processing of raw sensor data
from a real test rig. The main purposes of implementing condition monitoring in
hydraulic systems are to increase productivity, decrease maintenance costs and
increase safety. Since such systems are widely used in industry and becoming more
complex in function, reliability of the systems must be supported by an efficient
monitoring and maintenance scheme.
This work proposes an accurate state space model together with a novel
model-based fault diagnosis methodology. The test rig has been fabricated in the
Process Automation and Robotics Laboratory at UBC. First, a state space model of
the system is derived. The parameters of the model are obtained through either
experiments or direct measurements and manufacturer specifications. To validate the
model, the simulated and measured states are compared. The results show that under
normal operating conditions the simulation program and real system produce similar
state trajectories.
For the validated model, a condition monitoring scheme based on the
Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is developed. In simulations, both measurement and
process noises are considered. The results show that the algorithm estimates the
iii
system states with acceptable residual errors. Therefore, the structure is verified to
be employed as the fault diagnosis scheme.
Five types of faults are investigated in this thesis: loss of load, dynamic
friction load, the internal leakage between the two hydraulic cylinder chambers, and
the external leakage at either side of the actuator. Also, for each leakage scenario,
three levels of leakage are investigated in the tests. The developed UKF-based fault
monitoring scheme is tested on the practical system while different fault scenarios
are singly introduced to the system. A sinusoidal reference signal is used for the
actuator displacement. To diagnose the occurred fault in real time, three criteria,
namely residual moving average of the errors, chamber pressures, and actuator
characteristics, are considered. Based on the presented experimental results and
discussions, the proposed scheme can accurately diagnose the occurred faults.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The occurrence of hot tearing during solidification is one of the major factors influencing both the quality and productivity of aluminum castings. In order to reduce the formation of hot tears, quantitative information regarding both hot tearing formation and semi-solid deformation is essential.
In this study, the mechanisms of hot tearing and semi-solid deformation have been investigated via two novel techniques: x-ray micro-tomography on material deformed in the semi-solid region, and development of a three phase microstructural model based on a geometry derived from a Voronoi diagram with rounded corners and porosity. Numerical techniques were utilized to quantify both the size evolution and orientation of internal damage relative to void growth. In order to conduct the above research, a new semi-solid tensile deformation methodology was devised which uses a two thermocouple control technique to enable accurate measurement of semi-solid tensile strength and ductility. The experimental work was conducted on the aluminum – magnesium alloy AA5182 in the as-cast and hot isostatic pressing (HIP) states.  
The x-ray micro-tomography technique was used to observe that semi-solid deformation is accommodated by internal damage via growth of as-cast porosity and the nucleation of new damage-based voids. As the volume fraction of damage increases, the growth of voids occurs in an orientation perpendicular to the loading direction, both through expansion within the grain boundary liquid and via coalescence between voids. The damage then localizes, causing failure. 
The finite element semi-solid microstructural model was used to explore the effects of fraction solid, fraction porosity, and grain size on semi-solid constitutive behaviour. The simulations revealed that increased grain size and fraction porosity lead to a reduction in flow stress for a given fraction solid. Furthermore, local strain accumulation was linked to hot tearing, since strain localizes in the liquid very early in the deformation process. Based on the model predictions, a new constitutive relationship was developed over the range 0.75 &lt; fs &lt; 0.95.
Together, these two techniques have provided powerful new insight, such as the critical role played by as-cast porosity, on the phenomena of hot tearing and semi-solid deformation in aluminum alloys.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Since the late nineteenth century, Switzerland, a self-professed “playground” and “classroom” of the world, has successfully promoted itself as a desirable destination for international study and tourism. The historically entangled private schooling and tourism industries have steadily communicated idealised images of educational tourism in Switzerland via advertising. Concentrating on the period 1890 -1945 – when promotional ties between tourism organisations and private schools solidified – this thesis investigates the social construction of educational tourist place in two different types of promotion aimed at English-speaking markets: private international school prospectuses and education-focused tourism brochures. An analysis of early prospectuses from three long-standing private international schools and of education-focused tourism guides written by municipal organisations, travel agencies, school boards and the Swiss government revealed highly visual, ideologically-charged textual representations of locations and markets simultaneously defined, idealised and commodified international education in Switzerland. Chapters provide close interpretation of documents and aim, through thick description, to understand specific place-making examples within a wider socio-historical context. Chapter One examines the earliest prospectuses of Le Rosey and Brillantmont, two of the world’s must exclusive Swiss schools (1890-1916). An examination of photo-essay style prospectuses reveals highly selective portrayals of “Château” architecture communicated capacity to deliver a “high-class” and gender appropriate Swiss finishing. Visual cues hallmarking literary and sporting preferences indicated texts catered to the gaze of social-climbing, Anglo-centric markets desirous a continental cosmopolitan education that was not overly “foreign.” Chapter Two analyses the social construction of towns in French-speaking Switzerland as attractive educational centres (1890-1914). It explores how guides promoting Geneva, Neuchâtel and Lausanne constructed an idealised study-abroad landscape through thematic testaments to the educative capacities of local human and natural landscapes. The remaining chapters explore interwar texts. Chapter Three examines a high-altitude institute’s use of the idealising skills of high-end tourism poster artists to manufacture a pleasant, school-like image for the mountain sanatoria-like campus of Beau Soleil. Chapter Four investigates two series of education-focused tourism guidebooks which promoted education in Switzerland. An examination of a Swiss National Tourist Office series reveals discourses of nationhood racialised the Swiss as natural-born pedagogues and constructed Switzerland as a safe, moral destination populated by cooperative, multi-lingual and foreign student-friendly folk. An analysis of R. Perrin Travel Agency’s series explores guidebooks which openly classified education as a tourism commodity. The final chapter examines Le Rosey and Brillantmont’s interwar prospectuses within the context of complex, transnational schooling and school advertising practices. An analysis of images of school sports at winter holiday resorts suggests prospectuses expressed the sense of freedom which accompanies upper-class identity more so than any sense of gender-driven restriction.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Skewed somatic X inactivation (XCI), X-linked gene overexpression and abnormal X&#xd;
content have been associated with breast and ovarian cancer. Partial or complete&#xd;
reactivation of the inactive X in females may be a step in breast and ovarian cancer&#xd;
progression, leading to overexpression of some tumour enhancing gene. Markers of an X&#xd;
reactivation event were examined: X gene dosage, expression, and methylation in 8&#xd;
ovarian cancer cell lines. Another marker of an X reactivation event, skewed XCI, was&#xd;
assayed in peripheral blood DNA from 106 breast and/or ovarian cancer patients (52&#xd;
BRCA1 mutation carriers, 24 BRCA2 mutation carriers, 30 non-mutation carriers), 147&#xd;
age-matched population controls. Combined RNA/DNA FISH was used to quantify the&#xd;
number of inactive Xs compared to total number of Xs. Five cell lines had increased X&#xd;
content. Three cell lines localized XIST to the presumptive inactive X; however the&#xd;
numbers of inactive Xs were variable. Expression levels of 8 X-linked genes were&#xd;
assessed by real-time PCR. Expression was inconsistent between different genes and&#xd;
among cell lines, ranging from a 2 to 300-fold increase compared to a control. Overall,&#xd;
expression was greatly increased for genes subject to inactivation but not increased in&#xd;
genes that escape inactivation for most ovarian cancer cell lines. Methylation at AR and FMR1 was quantified by a real-time PCR based assay and SNuPE respectively.&#xd;
Methylation was lower than expected for 7 of 8 ovarian cancer cell lines at AR or FMR1,&#xd;
while three cell lines had low or no methylation for both genes. Skewed XCI was&#xd;
evaluated using a methylation-based PCR assay at AR. There was no significant increase in skewing above 90% for any cancer group assayed. In addition, two markers of X reactivation were assayed in two low passage cultures of normal ovarian surface epithelium from BRCA1 mutation positive breast cancer patients. One sample did not&#xd;
localize XIST to the inactive X and three of five genes subject to inactivation were&#xd;
overexpressed. In summary, there is evidence for loss of X silencing or gain of active X&#xd;
content in ovarian cancer cell lines and normal ovarian surface epithelium from BRCA1&#xd;
mutation carriers.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Game theoretic methods for networked sensors and dynamic spectrum access</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Maskery, Michael</dc:creator>
<dc:subject>game theory</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>sensor networks</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Automated devices enabled by wireless communications are deployed for a variety of purposes.
As they become more ubiquitous, their interaction becomes increasingly important
for coexistence when sharing a scarce resource, and for leveraging potential cooperation to achieve larger design goals.
This thesis investigates the use of game theory as a tool for design and analysis of networked systems of automated devices
in the areas of naval defence, wireless environmental monitoring through sensor networks, and cognitive radio wireless communications.

In the first part, decentralized operation of naval platforms deploying
electronic countermeasures against missile threats is studied.
The problem is formulated as a stochastic game in which platforms independently plan and execute
dynamic strategies to defeat threats in two situations: where coordination is impossible due to lack of
communications, and where platforms hold different objectives but can coordinate, according
to the military doctrine of Network Enabled Operations.
The result is a flexible, robust model for missile deflection for advanced naval groups.

Next, the problem of cooperative environmental monitoring and communication in energy-constrained wireless sensor networks
is considered from a game-theoretic perspective.  This leads to novel protocols in which sensors cooperatively trade off
performance with energy consumption with low communication and complexity overhead.
Two key results are an on-line adaptive learning algorithm for tracking the correlated equilibrium set of a slowly
varying sensor deployment game, and an analysis of the equilibrium properties of threshold policies in a
game with noisy, correlated measurements.

Finally, the problem of dynamic spectrum access for systems of cognitive radios is considered.  A game theoretic formulation
leads to a scheme for competitive bandwidth allocation which respects radios' individual interests while enforcing fairness
between users.  An on-line adaptive learning scheme is again proposed for negotiating fair, equilibrium resource allocations, while
dynamically adjusting to changing conditions.</dc:description>

<dc:title>A combined clustering and placement algorithm for FPGAs</dc:title>

<dc:subject>clustering</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>placement</dc:subject>
<dc:description>One of the major drawbacks of reprogrammable microchips, such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), is an inherent speed disadvantage over ASIC technologies.  To mitigate this speed disadvantage, this thesis presents a novel algorithm to improve timing performance at the possible expense of area and runtime.  The algorithm presented leverages node duplication and a depth-optimal initial clustering to provide a starting point for a non-greedy, iterative optimization technique using detailed placement and timing information to develop the final clustering and placement solutions. 

For a set of benchmarks commonly used in FPGA research, the proposed algorithm achieves an 11\% critical-path delay improvement compared to the VPR academic tool flow.  This performance improvement is obtained at the expense of a 44\% increase in area usage and a 26x increase in maximum runtime.  Techniques have also been implemented to sacrifice performance to moderate the area or runtime increases.  For a 1\% critical-path delay penalty, the runtime can be improved by a factor of 4.  The algorithm also provides facilities to impose area restrictions, in which case timing degradation is proportional to the area saved.</dc:description>

<dc:description>While it is known that primitive, low-level visual stimuli such as abrupt visual onsets or luminance changes can bias attentional orienting without willful intent on the part of the observer, comparatively little is known about how attention functions in rich, dynamic, meaningful contexts, such as those that comprise our everyday lives. The primary motivating hypothesis of this investigation is that, given our intrinsic needs as evolved social organisms, as well as our capability for behavioral flexibility, the attention system should be sensitive not only to low-level stimulus features, but also to complex stimuli that provide behaviorally relevant information. Three separate lines of research will be presented, each one providing a unique perspective on this issue. The first examined attentional orienting to socially relevant stimuli, finding that eye gaze serves as particularly potent cue for attentional orienting, driving the cortical orienting network more robustly than non-social stimuli, and resulting in a larger attention-related modulation of the early visual processing of stimuli appearing at attended locations. The second line of inquiry investigated patterns of eye movements while participants viewed naturalistic navigational scenes, revealing a dynamic interplay of orienting to the various behaviorally relevant aspects of the scene. The third set of studies specifically addressed whether, given the relevance of heading information for guiding navigational behavior, there is evidence that attention can be oriented automatically to the heading point in an optic flow field simulating the patterns of visual stimulation that accompany self-motion. Together, the results converge on the conclusion that attention can be oriented automatically in a dynamic, flexible, and continuous manner on the basis of complex visual stimuli that provide behaviorally relevant information.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>1995 Kobe earthquake</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>community development</dc:subject>
<dc:description>This is a study of how two small neighbourhoods, Mano and Mikura, recovered from the 1995 Kobe (Japan) earthquake, with a particular focus on the relationship between community vulnerability and capacity. Few studies have examined these interactions, even though vulnerability reduction is recognized to be a vital component of community recovery. Drawing from literature on disaster recovery, community development, vulnerability analysis, community capacity building and the Kobe earthquake, a community vulnerability and capacity model is elaborated from Blaikie et al.’s Pressure and Release Model (1994) to analyze the interactions. The Mano and Mikura cases are analyzed by applying this model and relating outcomes to the community’s improved safety and quality of community lives. Based on the experience of Mano, appropriate long-term community development practices as well as community capacity building efforts in the past can contribute to the reduction of overall community vulnerability in the post-disaster period, while it is recovering. On the other hand, the Mikura case suggests that even though the community experiences high physical and social vulnerability in the pre-disaster period, if the community is able to foster certain conditions, including active CBOs, adequate availability and accessibility to resources, and a collaborative working relationship with governments, the community can make progress on recovery. Although both Mano and Mikura communities achieved vulnerability reduction as well as capacity building, the long-term sustainability of the two communities remains uncertain, as issues and challenges, such as residual and newly emerging physical vulnerability, negative or slow population growth and aging, remained to create vulnerability to future disasters. The case studies reveal the interactions of community vulnerability and capacity to be highly complex and contingent on many contextual considerations.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Prediction of low-frequency sound-pressure fields in fitted rooms for active noise control</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Chan, Gary Ka-Yue</dc:creator>
<dc:subject>acoustics</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>noise control</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Low-frequency noise is a health concern for workers in industrial workshops; rooms of highly varying size and dimensions, usually containing obstacles (the ‘fittings’). Low-frequency noise can be generated from sources such as reciprocating or rotating machinery, or ventilation systems. As the exposure time to the noise lengthens, workers are increasingly at risk to harmful effects such as hearing loss, communication difficulty, personal discomfort, and even nausea from induced body vibrations. Passive methods of noise control, such as absorption or barriers, generally perform better at high frequencies, but are inadequate at low frequencies. A proposed solution is active noise control, which relies on destructive interference of sound waves to reduce noise levels. However, this depends on phase, and how it is affected when sound waves encounter diffracting obstacles. In addition, the geometrical configuration of the active-control system must be optimized, which can be done using a prediction model. Sound-prediction models can also estimate the decibel level of sound within a given room configuration created by a source and the attenuation provided by the control system. Therefore, it is of interest to develop a model that predicts sound propagation in fitted rooms with phase. In this thesis, sound-pressure fields were investigated in rooms containing parallelepiped obstacles at low frequencies for which the wavelength is comparable to the obstacle dimensions. The geometric theory of diffraction (GTD) was used to model edge diffraction from an obstacle and, thus, the pressure field in shadow regions. A ray-tracing prediction model was improved to consider both the amplitude and phase of sound fields, and also the effects of edge diffraction. To validate the prediction model, experiments were performed in an anechoic chamber where a source and diffracting objects were located. In collaboration with Dr Valeau at the Université de Poitiers in France, a second model based on the finite element method (FEM) was used to compare prediction results. It was found that the phase depends mostly on the direct unblocked source-to-receiver distance. The FEM and experimental results showed that occluding objects cause phase shifts. The implementation of first-order diffraction into the ray-tracing program was successful in predicting shadow zones, thus producing a better prediction of realistic sound fields in rooms with obstacles.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Mutual information derived functional connectivity of the electroencephalogram (EEG)</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lee, Pamela Wen-Hsin</dc:creator>
<dc:subject>mutual information</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>functional connectivity</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Monitoring the functional connectivity between brain networks is becoming increasingly important in elucidating brain functionality in normal and disease states. Current methods of detecting networks in the recorded EEG such as correlation and coherence are limited by the fact that they assume stationarity of the relationship between channels, and rely on linear dependencies. Here we utilize mutual information (MI) as the metric for determining nonlinear statistical dependencies between electroencephalographic (EEG) channels. Previous work investigating MI between EEG channels in subjects with widespread diseases of the cerebral cortex had subjects simply rest quietly with their eyes closed. In motor disorders such as Parkinson’s disease (PD), abnormalities are only expected during performance of motor tasks, but this makes the assumption of stationarity of relationships between EEG channels untenable. We therefore propose a novel EEG segmentation method based on the temporal dynamics of the cross-spectrogram of the computed Independent Components (ICs). After suitable thresholding of the MI values between channels in the temporally segmented EEG, graphical theoretical analysis approaches are applied to the derived networks. The method was applied to EEG data recorded from six normal subjects and seven PD subjects on and off medication performing a motor task involving either their right hand only or both hands simultaneously. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests demonstrated statistically significant difference between subject groups. This proposed segmentation/MI network method appears to be a promising approach for EEG analysis.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>solid-oxide fuel cell impedance model</dc:subject>
<dc:description>A numerical model of the steady state and alternating current behaviour of a solid-oxide fuel cell is presented to explore the possibilities to diagnose and identify degradation mechanisms in a minimally invasive way using impedance spectroscopy.  This is the first report of an SOFC impedance model to incorporate degradation, as well as the first one to include the ribbed interconnect geometry, using a 2-D approximation.  Simulated degradation modes include: electrode/electrolyte delamination, interconnect oxidation, interconnect/electrode interface detachment, and anode sulfur poisoning.  Detailed electrode-level simulation replaces the traditional equivalent circuit approach, allowing the simulation of degradation mechanisms that alter the shape of the current path.  The SOFC impedance results from calculating the cell response to a small oscillatory perturbation in potential.  Starting from the general equations for mass and charge transport, and assuming isothermal and isobaric conditions, the system variables are decomposed into a steady-state component and a small perturbation around the operating point.  On account of the small size of the imposed perturbation, the time dependence is eliminated, and the original equations are converted to a new linear, time independent, complex-valued system, which is very convenient from a numerical viewpoint.  Geometrical and physical modifications of the model simulate the aforementioned degradation modes, causing variations in the impedance.  The possibility to detect unique impedance signatures is discussed, along with a study of the impact of input parameter inaccuracies and parameter interaction on the presented results.  Finally, a study of pairs of concurrent degradation modes reveals the method’s strengths and limitations in terms of its diagnosis capabilities.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>energy minimization</dc:subject>
<dc:description>This thesis presents a new method for the controllable damping of deformable objects.  The method evolves from physically based techniques; however, it allows for non-physical, but visually plausible motion.  This flexibility leads to a simple interface, with intuitive control over the behaviour of the material.

This method is particularly suited for strongly damped materials, which account for the majority of objects of interest to animation, since it produces non-oscillatory behaviour.  This is similar to critical damping, except that it affects all modes independently.  The new method is based on the minimization of a slightly modified version of total energy.  This framework can be used to simulate many other physical phenomena, and therefore lends itself to coupling with other simulations.

Implementation details for a simple example are given.  Results are shown for varying parameters and compared to those produced by a traditional method.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) is essential for the growth and survival of HER-2 over-expressing breast cancer cells</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lee, Cathy</dc:creator>
<dc:subject>YB-1</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>breast cancer</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>HER-2</dc:subject>
<dc:description>The human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER-2) is over-expressed in 20-30% of breast carcinomas and is a prognostic marker for poor patient outcome. We previously identified the transcription/translation factor Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) to be a novel substrate of AKT which binds to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER-2 promoters once phosphorylated (Wu J et al. 2006). YB-1 is over-expressed in approximately 40% of breast cancers; its expression is strongly correlated with HER-2 and is associated with poor patient survival. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the functional role of YB-1 in HER-2 over-expressing breast cancer, we silenced the expression of this factor in BT474-m1 and MDA-MB-453 cells. The loss of YB-1 inhibited the growth of BT474-m1 and MDA-MB-453 cells in monolayer and/or in soft agar. Consistent with this, we found a decrease in the expression of YB-1 responsive gene egfr and/or her-2 in BT474-m1 and MDA-MB-453 cells, which could begin to explain how growth is promoted by this factor. Furthermore, loss of YB-1 expression induced apoptosis in BT474-m1 cells. Beyond its role in tumor growth, YB-1 is also strongly linked to drug resistance. We therefore addressed whether it could play a part in Herceptin sensitivity. Herceptin is currently being used to treat patients with HER-2 positive breast cancer; however, only 30% of the patients respond to the therapy and many of them develop resistance within the first year of treatment. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to understand the biology of HER-2 over-expressing breast cancer to develop novel therapies that can benefit more patients. First we established that Herceptin inhibited BT474-m1 cell growth in anchorage-independent conditions whereas MDA-MB-453 cells were resistant to this treatment. We subsequently demonstrated that knock-down of YB-1 increased sensitivity of BT474-m1 cells to Herceptin while MDA-MB-453 cells failed to respond to the combination treatment. The mechanism for Herceptin resistance in MDA-MB-453 cells still remains elusive and requires further investigation. Thus far, we conclude that YB-1 is needed for the growth and survival of HER-2 positive BT474-m1 and MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells by inducing members of the HER family.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Using genotypic and phenotypic methods to determine the HIV co-receptor phenotype in the clinical setting</dc:title>

<dc:subject>Prediction</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Objective: The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) currently infects over 30 million people worldwide. It uses one of two main co-receptors to infect cells. The primary objective of this thesis is to evaluate genotypic and phenotypic assays for co-receptor usage in the clinical setting and investigate approaches for improvement of these assays.
Methods: The concordance of recombinant co-receptor phenotyping assays and the predictive ability of genotype-based methods including the ‘11/25’ rule, position specific scoring matrices (PSSMs), and support vector machines (SVMs) were evaluated in the clinical setting using patient-derived plasma samples. Samples and patient data were evaluated in cross-sectional analyses from a retrospective population-based cohort of HIV-infected individuals enrolled in the HIV/AIDS Drug Treatment Program in British Columbia, Canada.
Results: Current implementations of HIV V3 region-based predictors for HIV co-receptor usage tested on patient derived samples are inadequate in the clinical setting, primarily due to low sensitivities as a result of difficult to detect minority species. Recombinant phenotype assays also show discordances when tested against each other on the same set of patient derived samples, raising doubts if any of these assays can truly be considered a ‘gold standard’. Significant associations between clinical progression, viral sequence-based predictors of co-receptor usage and the output of recombinant assays are observed, suggesting that sensitivity can be improved by incorporating CD4% into genotype-based predictors. This is verified with a SVM model which showed a 17% increase in sensitivity when CD4% was incorporated into training and testing. 
Conclusion: This work in this thesis has exposed the difficulty in determining the co-receptor phenotype in the clinical setting, primarily due to minority species.  Although genotypic methods of screening for HIV co-receptor usage prior to the administration of CCR5 antagonists may reduce costs and increase turn-around time over phenotypic methods, they are currently inadequate for use in the clinical setting due to low sensitivities. Although the addition of clinical parameters such as CD4 count significantly increases the predictive ability of genotypic methods, the presence of low-levels of X4 virus continues to reduce the sensitivity of both genotypic and phenotypic methods.</dc:description>

<dc:description>International disputes over access to water resources can act as a catalyst for conflict or cooperation amongst nations. In the case of Israel and the occupied West Bank, water conflict further exacerbates preexisting political tension, and yet a peaceful and equitable solution between these countries could spark further negotiation. 
 
	Within this context, the Palestinian Hydrology Group conducted a water questionnaire amongst Palestinian households in the occupied West Bank in 2001. The aim of the PHG’s survey was to investigate which water management system would be the most suitable in terms of equity, cost-recovery, and long-term development of the resource. Ultimately the water pricing system that was recommended was an increasing block-tariff system, which prioritizes the delivery of necessary amounts of water used for basic needs amongst all users before further allocating water to other uses. However, most of the work conducted by the PHG was qualitative and based entirely on descriptive statistics.  Analysis regarding the relationships between water pricing, water consumption, and water needs, and how these relationships change over different scales, was not present in the final report.

	The purpose of this thesis to continue the research conducted by the PHG by analyzing the water questionnaire database as a means to further advise and direct water services within the occupied West Bank. In order to discern relationships between seasonal patterns of water pricing and consumption, an in-depth analysis of that data was conducted. In addition, perceived water needs were also examined. This analysis was performed at a variety of scales, including amongst districts, average monthly income levels, and connection/non-connection to a water network.

	Results indicate that some districts in the occupied West Bank are comparatively under-serviced. The economically poor district of Jenin seems to be in greatest need of stabilized and equitable water resources, followed by Hebron, Nablus and Ramallah. It was also observed that those within lower income brackets bear a disproportionate share of pricing fluctuations and, not surprisingly, low consumption levels. Connection/non-connection to a water network indicates that not only is consumption amongst non-connected households significantly low, but also that the difference between perceived water needs and water consumption is much greater than amongst connected households. This thesis supports the PHG’s recommendation for an increasing block-tariff system, since regression analysis indicates inequitable distribution and pricing amongst districts and income levels.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Manipulating proglucagon processing in the pancreatic alpha-cell for the treatment of diabetes</dc:title>

<dc:description>Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has received much attention as a novel diabetes therapeutic due to its pleotropic blood glucose-lowering effects, including enhancement of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, inhibition of gastric emptying and glucagon secretion, and promotion of beta-cell survival and proliferation.  GLP-1 is produced in the intestinal L-cell via processing of the proglucagon precursor by prohormone convertase (PC) 1/3.  Proglucagon is also expressed in the pancreatic alpha-cell; however, in this tissue PC2 is typically expressed instead of PC1/3, resulting in differential cleavage of proglucagon to yield glucagon as the major product.  We hypothesized that expression of PC1/3 in the alpha-cell would induce GLP-1 production in this tissue, and that this intervention would improve islet function and survival.  
Initial studies in alpha-cell lines demonstrate that adenoviral delivery of PC1/3 to alpha-cells increases GLP-1 production.  By encapsulating and transplanting either PC1/3- or PC2-expressing alpha-cells, the following studies show that while PC2-expressing alpha-cells increase fasting blood glucose and impair glucose tolerance, PC1/3-expressing alpha-cells decrease fasting blood glucose and dramatically improve glucose tolerance in normal mice and in mouse models of diabetes.  We further show that transplantation of PC1/3-expressing alpha-cells prevents streptozotocin (STZ)- induced hyperglycemia.  We also found that PC1/3-expressing alpha-cells also improve cold-induced thermogenesis in db/db mice, demonstrating a previously unappreciated effect of one or more of the PC1/3-derived proglucagon products.  Studies in isolated mouse islets demonstrate that adenoviral delivery of PC1/3 to isolated islets increases islet GLP-1 secretion and improves glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and islet survival.  Experiments with diabetic mice show that these GLP-1-producing islets are better able to restore normoglycemia in recipient mice following islet transplantation.
Taken together, these studies demonstrate that the alpha-cell can be induced to process proglucagon into PC1/3-derived products, and that this shift redirects the alpha-cell from a hyperglycemia-promoting fate to a blood glucose-lowering one.  This research opens up avenues for further investigating the therapeutic potential of inducing islet GLP-1 production in isolated human islets and in vivo in diabetes patients, and may represent a novel way to intervene in the progressive loss of beta-cells that characterizes diabetes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Although artificially selected goldfish exhibit swimming performance decrements, with the most derived morphotypes more affected, they can be utilized to explore functional design and movement pattern principles in aquatic vertebrates. Drag, steady swimming kinematics (tailbeat frequency, amplitude, stride length), energetics (standard and active metabolic rate), fast-start performance (average and maximum velocity and acceleration), stability in yaw and roll and propulsive muscle ultrastructural characteristics (mitochondrial volume density and spacing, myofibril diameter and capillary to fibre ratio in red and white muscle) were measured for four morphotypes: common, comet, fantail and eggfish, of comparable length (≈ 5 cm). A performance “pairing” (common and comet; fantail and eggfish) was a recurrent theme for most performance parameters. Vertebral numbers (30), segment lengths (≈ 0.85 mm) and standard metabolic rates (≈ 140 mg O2 kg-1 hr-1) are exceptions where values are the same. Fantail and eggfish drag and drag coefficients (referenced to frontally projected area ≈ 0.6 - 0.9) were higher (requiring more thrust at any given velocity) than those for the more streamlined common and comet (≈ 0.3 - 0.6; P &lt; 0.05). This is reflected in kinematics; tailbeat frequency and stride length at any given velocity for the common and comet are lower and higher respectively than that of the fantail and eggfish (P &lt; 0.05). Common and comet fatigue times are not significantly different from that of their ancestor, Crucian carp (P > 0.05), and are lower than those of the fantail and eggfish (P &lt; 0.05). The cost of transport of the common and comet (≈ 0.6 mg O2 kg-1 m-1) is accurately predicted from the mass scaling relationship for fish (P > 0.05), but values for the fantail and eggfish (≈ 1.3 mg O2 kg-1 m-1) are not (P &lt; 0.05). Eggfish steady swimming (dorsal fin absent) was characterized by rolling and yawing motions associated with significant energy losses. Common and comet fast-start performance (average velocity ≈ 0.45 m s-1, maximum velocity ≈ 1.2 m s-1, average acceleration ≈ 7.5 m s-2, maximum acceleration ≈ 35 m s-2) was similar to that of other locomotor generalists (e.g. trout). Eggfish maximum acceleration (≈ 5 m s-2) is poor due to the absence of inertial and lifting contributions to thrust from the dorsal fin and energy wasting rolling motions. Artificially selected fish can bear upon fitness related adaptations associated with form and movement, providing insights into the “performance envelope” of natural systems subject to ecological speciation.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Investigation of the immunostimulatory activity and vaccine potential of lipid encapsulated plasmid DNA and oligodeoxynucleoties</dc:title>

<dc:description>DNA vaccines offer unique promise as a means of generating immunity against infectious and malignant disease.  Unfortunately a number of obstacles, including rapid degradation of naked plasmid DNA (pDNA), poor cellular uptake by antigen presenting cells (APCs) and subsequent low levels of gene expression have limited the ability of DNA vaccines to raise sufficient immune responses towards the target antigen.  This thesis is focused on investigating the immunostimulatory potential of liposomal nanoparticulate (LN) formulations of pDNA (stabilized plasmid lipid particles; SPLP) and cytosine-guanine oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODN; LN CpG-ODN), and examining their ability to act together as a non-viral DNA vaccine in attempt to address the shortcomings of current DNA vaccine approaches.
One focus of this thesis concerns investigating the immunostimulatory activity of LN formulations of CpG-ODN and pDNA.  It is shown that despite dramatic differences in pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of LN CpG-ODN following intravenous (i.v.) and subcutaneous (s.c.) administration the resultant immune response is very similar, which is concluded to be due to the intrinsic ability of APCs to sequester LN CpG- ODN.   In addition, it is demonstrated that lipid encapsulation dramatically enhances the immunostimulatory potential of pDNA and it is observed that SPLP maintains immunostimulatory activity in Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) knock-out mice.  Together theses findings highlight the need for DNA-based therapies to consider both TLR9-dependent and -independent immunostimulatory activities of pDNA when constructing non-viral vectors. 
Furthermore, a new role for SPLP as a non-viral gene delivery vehicle for the generation of a systemically administered genetic vaccine in the presence of LN CpG-ODN is introduced.  The ability of vaccination with SPLP to act prophylactically, to protect mice from tumour challenge, and therapeutically, in a novel vaccination strategy where the antigen is expressed at the tumour site as a result of SPLP-mediated transfection, is explored, demonstrating that in the presence of LN CpG-ODN SPLP possesses potential as a non-viral delivery system for DNA-based cancer vaccines.
In summary, this work represents a substantial advance in the understanding of the immunostimulatory potential of both SPLP and LN CpG-ODN and provides insight into their ability to work together as a non-viral DNA vaccine.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>Group Cohomology</dc:subject>
<dc:description>In this work we study the space of group homomorphisms Hom(Γ,G) from a geometric
and simplicial point of view. The case in which the source group is a free abelian
group of rank n is studied in more detail since this space can be identified with the space of commuting n-tuples of elements from G. This latter case is of
particular interest when the target is a Lie group.

The simplicial approach allows us to to construct a family of spaces that filters the
classifying space of a group by filtering group theoretical information of the given
 group. Namely, we use the lower central series of free groups to construct a
family of simplicial subspaces of the bar construction of the classifying space of
a group. The first layer of this filtration is studied in more detail for
transitively commutative (TC) groups.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Coping with interpersonal sport stress in female adolescent soccer players: the role of perceived social support, cognitive appraisal, and trait social anxiety</dc:title>

<dc:subject>Stress</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>Adolescent</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Stress in sport is complex and can lead to a number of undesirable consequences such as burnout, performance difficulties, interpersonal problems, and injury. Lazarus’s (1991, 1999) Cognitive-Motivational-Relational model holds that stress is best understood as a transactional relationship between a person and their environment.  Stress is a process which is influenced by appraisals and coping. Appraisals are influenced by personal factors as well as environmental demands and the availability of external resources. Coping involves constantly changing cognitive and behavioral efforts to manage the perceived external and internal demands of a stressful situation (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984).       
       The present study examined how appraisal processes mediated (or were possibly moderated by) the effects of social anxiety and perceptions of teammate social support on how high school female soccer players thought they would cope with a hypothetical interpersonal stressor. The study also examined simple relationships among variables. The participants were 181 female high school soccer players from Greater Vancouver.  The athletes first completed two questionnaires designed to measure social anxiety (Interaction Anxiousness Scale; Leary, 1983a) and perceived social support from teammates (modified Social Provisions Scale; Weiss, 1974).  After reading the scenario, the athletes indicated their appraisal of threat and challenge (Stress Appraisal Measure; Peacock &amp; Wong, 1990) and how they thought they would cope (Coping Functions Questionnaire; Kowalski &amp; Crocker, 2001).	.
The initial findings indicated that challenge appraisals were moderately correlated with both emotion-focused (r = .41) and problem-focused coping (r = .51), whereas threat had a weak association with avoidance coping (r = .19). Using mediation analysis, the results indicated that challenge fully mediated the relationship between social support and emotion-focused coping, and partially mediated the relationship between social support and problem-focused coping.  Threat appraisals mediated the relationship between social anxiety and avoidance coping.  Contrary to hypotheses, there was no evidence that social anxiety or threat were related to emotion-focused coping. There was also no support that person variables (social anxiety, social support) moderated the effects of appraisal on coping.  The findings suggest that challenge appraisals and social support were key predictors of coping with interpersonal stress in this population.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Biogeographers have long searched for common processes responsible for driving diversification in the Holarctic region.  Although terrestrial flora and fauna have been well studied, much of the marine biogeographic work addresses patterns and processes occurring over a relatively recent timescale.  A prerequisite to comparative biogeographic analysis requires well-resolved phylogenies of similarly distributed taxa that diverged over a similar timeframe.  The overall aim of my Ph.D. thesis was to address fundamental questions in the systematics and biogeography of a family of Holarctic fish (Osmeridae) and place these results in a broad comparative biogeographic framework.  With eight conflicting morphological hypotheses, the northern hemisphere smelts have long been the subjects of systematic disagreement.  In addition to the uncertainty in the interrelationships within this family, the relationship of the Osmeridae to several other families remains unclear.
Using DNA sequence data from three mitochondrial and three nuclear genes from multiple individuals per species, I reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships among the 6 genera and 15 osmerid species.  Phylogenetic reconstruction and divergence dating yielded a well-resolved phylogeny of the osmerid genera and revealed several interesting evolutionary patterns within the family: (1) Hypomesus chishimaensis and H. nipponensis individuals are not reciprocally monophyletic, suggesting that they are conspecific and H. chishimaensis is a recently evolved freshwater ecotype that invaded the Kuril Islands following the last glaciation, (2) The trans-Pacific sister relationships in Hypomesus based on lateral line scale counts are not supported, implying that this phenotype evolved in parallel on each side of the North Pacific Ocean, (3) The Plecoglossidae are the Osmeridae sister group, (4) Over half of the characters from previous studies show evidence of parallel evolution; however, 27 traits reflect ancestral relationships, (5) Multiple divergences within the Osmeridae date to both the mid-Miocene cooling period and the Pliocene Bering Seaway opening, suggesting these events were important in the evolution of these fishes, and (6) Divergences in many marine taxa for which dated phylogenies are available are also correlated with these time periods.  Future research should target additional Holarctic marine taxa for further comparative analysis.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>Nickel mining</dc:subject>
<dc:description>As part of a strategic research initiative at UBC to design and evaluate integrated underground mining and mineral processing systems, work has been done to determine how to utilize the coarse rejects of pre-concentration in the underground environment.  An amenability study for nine orebodies from four of Xstrata Nickel’s Ontario operations evaluated both processing and waste disposal methods. Metallurgically the orebodies showed amenability to dense media separation and conductivity sorting.  The dense media results showed high mass rejections and high metal recoveries for all nine orebodies.  Conductivity sorter results were not as consistent, but still showed good results.  Dense media rejects were examined to determine the applicability of their use in rockfills and composite minefills.  The geotechnical properties indicated that the rejects would provide a competent material for minefills.  The mix designs were examined for both strength and rheological properties and showed that fills utilizing rejects were comparable to fills currently used by industry.  Composite fills containing rejects had significantly lower void ratios, decreasing cement requirements for a given strength requirement.  Conceptual designs for pre-concentration systems based on the metallurgical, reject characterization, and mix design were developed for each of the four mines in the study.  The designs took into consideration the current mining plans.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Conditional source-term estimation methods for turbulent reacting flows</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Jin, Bei</dc:creator>
<dc:subject>turbulent reacting flows</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Conditional Source-term Estimation (CSE) methods are used to obtain chemical closure in turbulent combustion simulation. 

A Laminar Flamelet Decomposition (LFD) and then a Trajectory Generated Low-Dimensional Manifold (TGLDM) method are combined with CSE in Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) simulation of non-premixed autoigniting jets. Despite the scatter observed in the experimental data, the predictions of ignition delay from both methods agree reasonably well with the measurements. The discrepancy between predictions of these two methods can be attributed to different ways of generating libraries that contain information of detailed chemical mechanism. The CSE-TGLDM method is recommended for its seemingly better performance and its ability to transition from autoignition to combustion. The effects of fuel composition and injection parameters on ignition delay are studied using the CSE-TGLDM method.

The CSE-TGLDM method is then applied in Large Eddy Simulation of a non-premixed, piloted jet flame, Sandia Flame D. The adiabatic CSE-TGLDM method is extended to include radiation by introducing a variable enthalpy defect to parameterize TGLDM manifolds. The results are compared to the adiabatic computation and the experimental data. The prediction of NO formation is improved, though the predictions of temperature and major products show no significant difference from the adiabatic computation due to the weak radiation of the flame. The scalar fields are then extracted and used to predict the mean spectral radiation intensities of the flame.

Finally, the application of CSE in turbulent premixed combustion is explored. A product-based progress variable is chosen for conditioning. Presumed Probability Density Function (PDF) models for the progress variable are studied. A modified version of a laminar flame-based PDF model is proposed, which best captures the distribution of the conditional variable among all PDFs under study. A priori tests are performed with the CSE and presumed PDF models. Reaction rates of turbulent premixed flames are closed and compared to the DNS data. The results are promising, suggesting that chemical closure can be achieved in premixed combustion using the CSE method.</dc:description>

<dc:title>The global network of marine protected areas: developing baselines and identifying priorities</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wood, Louisa Jane</dc:creator>
<dc:subject>marine protected areas</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>systematic conservation planning</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>conservation targets</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Recently adopted global marine protection targets aim to protect 10-30% of marine habitats within the next 3 to 5 years. However, these targets were adopted without prior assessment of their attainability. Moreover, our ability to monitor progress towards such targets has been constrained by a lack of robust data on marine protected areas (MPAs). In this thesis I present the results of the first explicitly marine-focused, global assessment of MPAs in relation to three global marine protection targets. Approximately 2.35 million km2, equivalent to 0.65% of the world’s oceans, are currently protected, and only 12% of that is ‘no-take’. Over the last two decades, the marine area protected globally has grown at ~5% per year. At this rate, even the most modest target is unlikely to be met for at least several decades. 

The utility of large-scale conservation targets has been repeatedly questioned, although mainly on ecological grounds. However, if, as is suggested here, their primary role is to motivate behavioural change, then a more serious problem is that they seem to be failing in this regard, too. I explore possible reasons for this and suggest two main problems: firstly, an as yet unmet need to develop a hierarchical system of targets that reflects the multi-scale and pluralistic nature of ecological and political systems; and secondly, feedback mechanisms between political will, perceived attainability, and target formulation which may impede implementation of the targets. 

Since the adoption of the global targets, no implementation strategy has been developed, which may also impede target attainment. In order to fill this gap, I applied a rarity-complementarity heuristic place prioritisation algorithm (PPA) to a dataset consisting of 1038 global species distributions with 0.5° latitude/longitude resolution, under ten scenarios devised to reflect the global targets. This is the first time that species distribution ranges of marine species have been used in a globally synthetic way, and is by far the largest application of a PPA to date. Global priority areas for protection are identified for each scenario, which may be used to identify where regional-scale protected areas network design efforts might be focused.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Methyl-CpG-Binding domain proteins and histone deacetylases in the stage-specific differentiation of olfactory receptor neurons</dc:title>
<dc:creator>MacDonald, Jessica</dc:creator>
<dc:subject>neural development</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>epigenetics</dc:subject>
<dc:description>DNA methylation-dependent gene silencing, catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and mediated by methyl binding domain proteins (MBDs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), is essential for mammalian development, with the nervous system demonstrating particular sensitivity to perturbations. Little is known, however, about the role of DNA methylation in the stage-specific differentiation of neurons. In the olfactory epithelium (OE), where neurogenesis is continuous and the cells demonstrate a laminar organization with a developmental hierarchy, we identified sequential, transitional stages of differentiation likely mediated by different DNMT, MBD and HDAC family members. Biochemically, HDAC1 and HDAC2 associate with repressor complexes recruited by both MBD2 and MeCP2. HDAC1 and HDAC2, however, are divergently expressed in the OE, a pattern that is recapitulated in the brain. Rather than simultaneous inclusion in a complex, therefore, the individual association of HDAC1 or HDAC2 may provide specificity to a repressor complex in different cell types. Furthermore, distinct transitional stages of differentiation are perturbed in the absence of MBD2 or MeCP2. MeCP2 is expressed in the most apical immature olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), and is up-regulated with neuronal maturation. In the MeCP2 null OE there is a transient delay in ORN maturation and an increase in neurons of an intermediate developmental stage. Two protein variants of MBD2 are expressed in the OE, with MBD2b expressed in cycling progenitor cells and MBD2a in the maturing ORNs. MBD2 null ORNs undergo increased apoptotic cell death. There is also a significant increase in proliferating progenitors in the MBD2 null OE, likely due, at least in part, to feedback from the dying ORNs, acting to up-regulate neurogenesis. Increased cell cycling in the MBD2 null is also observed post-lesion, however, in the absence of feedback back from the ORNs, a phenotype that is recapitulated by an acute inhibition of HDACs with valproic acid. Therefore, disruptions at both transitional stages of ORN differentiation are likely in the MBD2 null mouse. Together, these results provide the first evidence for a sequential recruitment of different MBD proteins and repressor complexes at distinct transitional stages of neuronal differentiation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Retinal degeneration is the progressive loss of neurons lining the posterior surface of the eye. Loss of a certain group of neurons called rod photoreceptors can occur as the result of genetic mutation. In humans, and in mammalian models of retinal degeneration, the death of these cells is permanent, and often followed by cone photoreceptor death, which leads to blindness. 

As a step towards understanding the implications of rod cell death in the retina, we generated transgenic X. laevis that expressed a novel form of caspase-9, with binding domains specific to the compound AP20187. We treated these transgenic animals with AP20187 and caused rod cell death by apoptosis in tadpoles and post metamorphic animals. Peak rod apoptosis occurred two days after drug exposure. We adapted an electroretinography apparatus, and protocols designed for mammals to measure functional changes in X. laevis rod and cone derived responses. We observed delayed secondary cone cell dysfunction after induced rod cell apoptosis, which was subsequently restored.  

These animals provide a simple and clinically relevant model of diseases like Retinitis pigmentosa, in which we will be able to probe in detail the mechanisms that govern cone cell dysfunction as a consequence of rod apoptosis. The unique ability of this species to recover from this insult will provide clues towards initiating similar recovery in humans.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Investigating the mechanical relationship between the feet and low-back</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Duval, Karine</dc:creator>
<dc:subject>biomechanics</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>human kinetics</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Introduction: Claims that foot orthoses can resolve low-back pain are common in the marketing of these devices. The claims are based on the notion that wearing the orthoses will limit excess pronation at the subtalar joint thus reducing excessive internal tibial and femoral rotations. Excess leg rotations increase the anterior tilt of the pelvis and subsequently the degree of lumbar lordosis. Since lumbar lordosis has been suggested as a cause of low-back pain, it is speculated that foot orthoses could be used to treat and prevent pain to the low-back by reducing the forward curvature of the spine. This mechanical link between foot function and the low-back has not been investigated by experimental studies.
Purpose: The purpose of this thesis was to investigate whether increased internal rotation of the femur induced an anterior tilt of the pelvis thus increasing the degree of lumbar lordosis and if external rotation induced a posterior pelvic tilt thus decreasing the degree of lumbar lordosis.
Methods: In order to internally and externally rotate the femur, participants placed their feet in 18 different foot positions. Seven of these positions ranged from 15 degrees of foot eversion to 15 degrees of foot inversion and 11 positions ranged from 40 degrees of external foot rotation to 40 degrees of internal foot rotation. Six cameras surrounded the motion capture area and angles of pelvic tilt and lumbar lordosis were calculated.
Results: Foot eversion and inversion did not have a statistically significant effect on pelvic tilt and lumbar lordosis. In-toeing had a statistically significant linear relationship with anterior pelvic tilt (R2=0.35, F1,131=69.79, p=0.00). Internally and externally rotating the feet had no effect on lumbar lordosis (R2=0.001, F1,153=0.09, p=0.77).
Conclusion: Internally rotating the legs caused the pelvis to tilt anteriorly but only at extreme ranges of motion, much greater than what would normally be seen during gait. At which point, lumbar angles remained unaffected. This study does not dispute the effectiveness of foot orthoses to treat low-back pain but the results do not support the mechanical link proposed as the mechanism by which they work.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Stroke is a pathological condition that causes extensive brain damage. During ischemic stroke, an excess of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate exerts many deleterious effects, which leads to cellular damage and cell death, a phenomenon appropriately termed excitotoxicity. Among the events triggered is the activation of the enzyme calpain, a protease whose action is dependent on the intracellular concentration of calcium, which is known to be elevated during excitotoxicity. In this thesis, I hypothesize that neuroprotective drugs can be better accumulated into stroke-affected regions by utilizing the actions of calpain. The extent of calpain activation was first investigated, and it was found to increase over time in both in vitro and in vivo models of stroke. Different amino acid sequences recognized and cleaved by calpain were then incorporated into the neuroprotective Tat-GluR2/3Y peptide. Although in vivo detection of modified Tat-GluR2/3Y peptides was unsuccessful due to technical difficulties, the accumulation of the therapeutic 3Y peptide fragments in neurons under excitotoxic conditions in vitro was found to increase with the CP-3 peptide, a peptide that is a modified version of the Tat-GluR2/3Y, with a sequence cleavable by calpain from the protein Collapsin Response Mediator Protein-3 (CRMP-3). These results suggest that it is possible to concentrate therapeutic agents into stroke-affected neurons, and this may translate into enhanced neuroprotective properties in both in vitro and in vivo animal stroke models.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This thesis examines the interaction of political-economic restructuring, sustainability, and the governance of municipal services in the province of Ontario, Canada. Two issues are studied: the restructuring of business models, and programs for sustainable infrastructure management (focusing on programs for the reduction of water consumption and production). The primary data are derived from a province-wide expert survey, archival research, a one-day expert workshop, and seven municipal case studies.&#xd;
&#xd;
Since the early 1990s, political-economic restructuring in Ontario predominantly reflects processes and policy orientations consistent with neoliberalization. Two strands of research posit particular relationships between neoliberalization and sustainability. One (associated with political ecology) asserts that neoliberalization yields negative outcomes for environmental policy. The other (ecological modernization) asserts that neoliberal restructuring leads to environmental improvements. This thesis tests and complicates both sets of claims. Specifically, neoliberalization does not necessarily induce improved programming for sustainability and can, hinder its development. Neoliberalization, however, is not the unique hindrance to progress on sustainability. Rather, a techno-physical approach to service delivery combined with governance arrangements that neither empower nor compel a variety of necessary actors presents a key barrier to sustainability.&#xd;
&#xd;
In terms of the restructuring of business models, I find that the primary neoliberal strategy is the depoliticization of governance through the pursuit of arms length business models for service delivery. This, however, is not readily accomplished in complete or straightforward ways. Municipal governments and anti-neoliberal alliances have complex relationships to neoliberalization that prove important in restructuring outcomes. Specifically, neoliberalization is also contested within municipal government and for environmental advocates, although their best option, the municipal department model remains unsatisfactory. &#xd;
&#xd;
Concerning sustainable infrastructure management, the thesis finds that up-take of supply and demand management in Ontario has been limited to date. This results from incentives created by policy processes associated with neoliberalization (specifically new public management) and technically-driven management methods in the water sector. Moreover, where programs for sustainable infrastructure management currently occur, they are rarely motivated by sustainability concerns. Importantly, however, sustainable infrastructure management is underdeveloped for reasons other than neoliberalization; governance arrangements and the continuing supply-side orientation of water utilities are other factors.</dc:description>

<dc:title>On the design and implementation of decision-theoretic, interactive, and vision-driven mobile robots</dc:title>

<dc:description>We present a framework for the design and implementation of visually-guided, interactive, mobile robots. Essential to the framework's robust performance is our behavior-based robot control architecture 
enhanced with a state of the art decision-theoretic planner that takes into account the temporal characteristics of robot actions and allows us to achieve principled coordination of complex subtasks implemented as robot behaviors/skills. We study two different models of the decision theoretic layer: Multiply Sectioned Markov Decision Processes (MSMDPs) under the assumption that
the world state is fully observable by the agent, and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) 
that remove the latter assumption and allow us to model the uncertainty in sensor measurements.
The MSMDP model utilizes a divide-and-conquer approach for solving problems with millions of states using concurrent actions. For solving large POMDPs, we present heuristics that improve the computational efficiency 
of the point-based value iteration algorithm while tackling the problem of multi-step actions using Dynamic Bayesian Networks.

In addition, we describe a state-of-the-art simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm for robots equipped 
with stereo vision. We first present the Monte-Carlo algorithm sigmaMCL for robot localization in 3D using
natural landmarks identified by their appearance in images. Secondly, we extend sigmaMCL and develop the sigmaSLAM
algorithm for solving the simultaneous localization and mapping problem for visually-guided, mobile robots. We
demonstrate our real-time algorithm mapping large, indoor environments in the presence of large changes in illumination, image blurring and dynamic objects.

Finally, we demonstrate empirically the applicability of our framework for developing interactive, mobile robots capable of completing complex tasks with the aid of a human companion. We present an award winning robot waiter for serving hors d'oeuvres at
receptions and a robot for delivering verbal messages among inhabitants of an office-like environment.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Quasi-objective Nonlinear Principal Component Analysis and applications to the atmosphere</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Lu, Beiwei</dc:creator>
<dc:subject>Atmospheric Science</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>Nonlinear Principal  Component Analysis</dc:subject>
<dc:description>NonLinear Principal Component Analysis (NLPCA) using three-hidden-layer
feed-forward neural networks can produce solutions that over-fit the data and
are non-unique. These problems have been dealt with by subjective methods
during the network training. This study shows that these problems are intrinsic
due to the three-hidden-layer architecture. A simplified two-hidden-layer
feed-forward neural network that has no encoding layer and no bottleneck and
output biases is proposed. This new, compact NLPCA model alleviates these
problems without employing the subjective methods and is called
quasi-objective.

The compact NLPCA is applied to the zonal winds observed at seven pressure
levels between 10 and 70 hPa in the equatorial stratosphere to represent the
Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) and investigate its variability and structure.
The two nonlinear principal components of the dataset offer a clear picture of
the QBO. In particular, their structure shows that the QBO phase consists of a
predominant 28.4-month cycle that is modulated by an 11-year cycle and a
longer-period cycle. The significant difference in variability of the winds
between cold and warm seasons and the tendency for a seasonal synchronization
of the QBO phases are well captured. The one-dimensional NLPCA approximation of
the dataset provides a better representation of the QBO than the classical
principal component analysis and a better description of the asymmetry of the
QBO between westerly and easterly shear zones and between their transitions.

The compact NLPCA is then applied to the Arctic Oscillation (AO) index and
aforementioned zonal winds to investigate the relationship of the AO with the
QBO. The NLPCA of the AO index and zonal-winds dataset shows clearly that, of
covariation of the two oscillations, the phase defined by the two nonlinear
principal components progresses with a predominant 28.4-month periodicity, plus
the 11-year and longer-period modulations. Large positive values of the AO
index occur when westerlies prevail near the middle and upper levels of the
equatorial stratosphere. Large negative values of the AO index arise when
easterlies occupy over half the layer of the equatorial stratosphere.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Forward modelling and inversion of streaming potential for the interpretation of hydraulic conditions from self-potential data</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Sheffer, Megan Rae</dc:creator>
<dc:subject>potential field geophysical methods</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>embankment dam seepage monitoring</dc:subject>
<dc:description>The self-potential method responds to the electrokinetic phenomenon of streaming potential and has been applied in hydrogeologic and engineering investigations to aid in the evaluation of subsurface hydraulic conditions. Of specific interest is the application of the method to embankment dam seepage monitoring and detection. This demands a quantitative
interpretation of seepage conditions from the geophysical data.

To enable the study of variably saturated flow problems of complicated geometry, a three-dimensional finite volume algorithm
is developed to evaluate the self-potential distribution resulting from subsurface fluid flow. The algorithm explicitly calculates
the distribution of streaming current sources and solves for the self-potential given a model of hydraulic head and prescribed distributions of the streaming current cross-coupling conductivity and electrical resistivity. A new laboratory apparatus is developed to measure the streaming potential coupling coefficient
and resistivity in unconsolidated soil samples. Measuring both of these parameters on the same sample under the same conditions
enables us to properly characterize the streaming current cross-coupling conductivity coefficient. I present the results of a laboratory investigation to study the influence of soil and fluid parameters on the cross-coupling coefficient, and characterize this property for representative well-graded embankment soils. The streaming potential signals associated with preferential seepage through the core of a synthetic embankment dam model are studied using the forward modelling algorithm and measured electrical properties to assess the sensitivity of the self-potential method in detecting internal erosion. Maximum self-potential anomalies are shown to be linked to large localized
hydraulic gradients that develop in response to piping, prior to any detectable increase in seepage flow through the dam. A linear
inversion algorithm is developed to evaluate the three-dimensional distribution of hydraulic head from self-potential data, given a known distribution of the cross-coupling coefficient and electrical resistivity. The inverse problem is solved by
minimizing an objective function, which consists of a data misfit that accounts for measurement error and a model objective function that incorporates a priori information. The algorithm is suitable
for saturated flow problems or where the position of the phreatic surface is known.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In the last decade there has been a substantial increase of new migrants into large cities in Việt Nam, changing the social, cultural, and political fabric of Hồ Chí Minh City.  Rapid urbanization and land use changes in Hồ Chí Minh City have occurred alongside mass internal migration.  The movement of people has become an important piece in the 1986 economic reforms of đổi mới and a main focus of Vietnamese public policy from the late 1990s until today.  With the influx of new actors comes a new set of social interactions and negotiations between people in daily life that are embedded within a broader socio-economic framework.  

New liberal policies on internal migration have spurred great mass internal migration into cities which has several implications for not only the entire country, but specific to this research, for the social dynamics of how Bình Trị Ðông ward is managing the influx of migrants.  Not only did this field research seek to explore the social relationships and integration among migrants living on the urban fringe but the issue of local governance and infrastructure provisions in the form of migrant housing is central to this research.  In short, this thesis asks: what are the social experiences of migrants living in Bình Trị Ðông?  What is the role of local government, if any, in managing the social and cultural changes among migrants?  My research finds that migrants are each striving towards their own individual goals of economic gains, treating Bình Trị Ðông as a temporary living space, thus preventing a strong sense of community and social bonds from flourishing.  Meanwhile, more equitable planning policies of prioritizing the needs of ordinary citizens over economic development signal a shift in local development policies.  Yet the government’s shift towards greater participation has not necessarily changed the lived experiences of residents.  Migrants here are oriented towards their own goals thus stunting interpersonal relationships and deepening social segregation, leading one to question what ties, if any, unite people in this neighborhood.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Physical habitat for instream biota derives from a combination of stream system structural and hydraulic phenomena. Consequently, the quantity and quality of physical habitat is dynamic both over time and in space along the river, laterally, longitudinally and vertically. Its characterization through stream assessment and classification leads to a better understanding of factors that determine and limit habitat extent and quality. This thesis investigates the effects of space and time on nearshore aquatic habitat in the gravel reach of Fraser River, British Columbia by employing a large river, stage-adaptive habitat classification system. The distribution and abundance of habitat are spatially quantified at the reach scale (32 km), and temporally quantified through a period of about 60 years at several adjacent gravel bars (7 km), and at approximately 500 m3 s-1 increments in discharge during the declining limb of the flood hydrograph at two well-developed gravel bars. Of the ten habitat types evaluated, the bar edge habitat type is most abundant by length and number of units. However, its relative importance is reduced when weighted by fish-habitat association characteristics. Preferred habitat types (channel nook, eddy pool and open nook) are frequent and available to aquatic organisms, and most common at well-developed bars and in zones of equilibrium long-term sedimentation. Preferred habitat was at a maximum 30 years ago when major new bars developed and the thalweg shifted, effectively increasing the amount of bar shoreline and nearshore habitat. This increase is due to substantial change in river planform morphology following a 30-year period of large annual floods. However, amounts of habitat did not increase exclusively during periods of higher than average flows, or decrease exclusively during periods of lower than average flows. Instead, habitat abundance response to flow may occur with a two- or three-year lag. Short term changes in stage are critical to amount of preferred habitat. Optimal discharge for maximum preferred habitat vailability is in the range of approximately 2500 m3 s-1 to 4000 m3 s-1, which approximates long term mean flow. As flow increases, the proportion of preferred habitat compared with total bar shoreline decreases. Comparison with the 2006 flow duration curve shows that 15 – 30 % of discharges are optimal for maximum fish density and biomass. These discharges occurred during April 27 to May 17 and July 14 to August 7, 2006.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Modeling chalcopyrite leaching kinetics</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Trejo-Gallardo, Jaime</dc:creator>
<dc:subject>Chalcopyrite kinetics</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>Leaching</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) is the most abundant of the copper sulfides and also one of the
most refractory for leaching. Several processing routes have been proposed to
overcome drawbacks associated with environmental problems related to copper
extraction from this mineral. Atmospheric leaching in acidic ferric sulfate is regarded as
being particularly attractive over other hydrometallurgical systems. However, the
challenge has been to overcome the problem of slow extraction rates due to passivity
encountered at high solution potentials in this system. This highlights the need to
investigate better operating conditions to optimize copper extraction and prevent the
problem of passivation, and to develop suitable modeling tools to assess and diagnose
leaching performance.
In this work, a dissolution rate expression for chalcopyrite leaching in acidic ferric sulfate
media is proposed accounting for effects in the active and passive regions under
potentials from 415 to 550 mV (Ag/AgCl). A model of chemical speciation in the bulk
solution elucidates the idea of passivation caused by precipitation of ferric species and
their consequent adsorption onto the chalcopyrite surface. Electrochemical studies on
massive samples of chalcopyrite involving characterization and modeling of the anodic
and cathodic half-cell reactions of chalcopyrite leaching together with mixed potential
considerations lead to the development of the mathematical expression for dissolution rate.
The mathematical model was calibrated with electrochemical parameters and results
are in good agreement with real leaching data from batch tests for solution potential
regions where passivity is not observed. On the other hand, the passive region was
modeled by means of adjusting parameters related to adsorption energies of the
passivating species. Results of the model for this region deviate from real data as
potential becomes higher probably due to diffusion resistance through a layer
composed of ferric complexes.</dc:description>

<dc:title>The greenhouse tomato industry in Delta, British Columbia</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Mendis, Asoka</dc:creator>
<dc:subject>agriculture</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>geography</dc:subject>
<dc:description>This focus of this dissertation is the greenhouse tomato industry in Delta, British Columbia. Using a conceptual framework assembled from Regulation theory (including the concept of food regimes) and the political economy of agriculture, I explore the origins and development of the industry in Delta. I argue that sub-national regulation has historically played a pivotal role in the agricultural development of the region. The impact of such regulation on the greenhouse industry, however, is contingent upon the specific regime of accumulation. I make the case, for example, that regulation instituted in the early 20th century under an extensive regime of accumulation acts as a fetter on the industry under a post-Fordist regime of accumulation. Furthermore, I make the argument that the emergence and consolidation of Delta’s greenhouse tomato industry can best be understood through the deployment of the concept of food regimes. Thus the local industry can be seen as part of global trends in food production and consumption and which have come to characterise the third food regime.  
	
In this thesis I also examine the ‘nature’ of the tomato and of greenhouse production. I demonstrate that, beginning in the mid-19th century, the tomato has been transformed into an input amenable to such industrial processes as canning. Using the conceptual tools offered by the political economy of agriculture, I further argue that the technique of greenhouse production is a result of the process of ‘appropriation’. That is, the discrete elements of the agricultural production process have been appropriated by industrial capital and reassembled as a technologically intensive system of plant production. However, and using the case study, I illustrate how this process of appropriation has created a new set of ‘natural’ obstacles within a fairly distinctive form of industrial agriculture.</dc:description>

<dc:title>A study of the mechanism of action of novel inhibitors of tumour cell invasion</dc:title>
<dc:creator>McHardy, Lianne M.</dc:creator>
<dc:subject>Cancer</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>Drug Discovery</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Metastasis is the leading cause of death in cancer patients. Tumour invasion and migration are critical aspects of metastatic progression. A forward chemical genetics project was initiated in an effort to identify novel compounds that inhibit tumour invasion. After screening a natural extract library, two novel inhibitors were identified: motuporamine C (MotC) and strongylophorine-26 (STP-26). Structure-activity studies identified dihdyromotuporamine C (dhMotC) as a potent and easily synthesized analogue. In this work, the mechanism of activity of dhMotC and STP-26 was investigated. It was found that both dhMotC and STP-26 affect cellular shape. dhMotC induced thick central actin stress fibres and large focal adhesions and caused cells to contract. STP-26 also induced adhesion formation but it reduced stress fibres and caused increased cell spreading. Both inhibitors activated Rho GTPase, a result which was shown to mediate, in large part, the anti-invasion activity of these molecules. Motuporamines also induce the formation of membrane-rich inclusions at the peri-nuclear region in cells. Motuporamines cause an increase in lysosomal pH and inhibit lysosomal function, such that EGFR/EGF complexes internalized in the presence of dhMotC do not get degradad. This inhibition of EGF degradation is not dependent on Rho activity. However, the anti-invasive activity of motuporamine analogues correlates well with their ability to induce the formation of membrane-rich inclusions. Thus, alteration in membrane trafficking or degradation of cellular membranes may be mechanistically related to the anti-invasion effect of motuporamines.  A systematic genome-wide yeast haploinsufficiency screen was employed in an effort to identify possible targets of dhMotC. Yeast screening resulted in a list of 21 mutant strains which showed increased drug sensitivity. Sphingolipid biosynthesis was identified as a target in yeast cells. By testing other genes from the list, ARF1 was identified as a target that partially mediates the anti-invasive activity in human cells. The results of this body of work show that Rho and ARF1 are important molecular players in the mechanism of tumour cell invasion. This knowledge will contribute to the development of future anti-metastasis therapies and to the development of small molecules for use as biological probes to investigate the molecular basis of metastasis.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Constructing everyday notions of healthy eating: exploring how people of three ethnocultural backgrounds in Canada engage with food and health structures</dc:title>

<dc:description>Despite widespread health promotion and nutrition education efforts, gaps between official healthy eating messages and people’s actual eating practices persist. There is increasing recognition that emphasizing individual responsibility for eating may have limited applicability in improving people’s health. Many experts advocate that future research on healthy eating should involve exploration of how food practices are shaped by social structures (or determinants) and individual agency.
The purpose of this study was to explore the ways in which people engage with food structures to construct everyday notions of healthy eating. ‘Food structures’ draws on the concept of ‘structure,’ described by the social theorist Anthony Giddens, to refer to the range of food rules and resources people draw on. The research was conducted as part of a qualitative study on family food decision-making that included 144 participants from 13 African Nova Scotian, 10 European Nova Scotian, 12 Punjabi British Columbian and 11 European British Columbian families. These groups were chosen for their potential differences in perspectives based on place, ethnocultural background and histories of immigration to Canada. 
Data collection consisted of individual interviews with three or more family members aged 13 and older, and, with each family, observation of a grocery shopping trip and a family meal. Analysis followed common qualitative procedures including coding, memoing and thematic analysis. 
Together, the analyses support views that the gaps between official healthy eating messages and people’s eating practices may not be closed by further education about how to eat. Drawing on the theoretical concepts of Anthony Giddens and Michael Foucault, the findings suggest that one way to understand why people eat the way they do and how changes in eating habits occur is to think about the constant exposure to change through everyday, taken-for-granted practices. The findings also suggest that further healthy eating discourses may require more reflection with respect to the roles of nutrition educators and the social roles/autonomy of people in goals for health and well-being. Dietary goals for the population cannot be considered as isolated scientific objectives without taking into consideration how healthy eating discourses provide social standards beyond messages about healthy eating.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Supraspinal actions of pentobarbital on transmission through the spinothalamic tract</dc:title>

<dc:description>Despite the advances made in our understanding of the molecular mechanistic actions of general anesthetics very little is known about the in vivo neural circuits involved in creating the state of general anesthesia. To date the common consensus is that general anesthetics act ubiquitously within the CNS. Recently, (Devor and Zalkind, 2001) have reported that microinjections of pentobarbital (PB) into a discrete brainstem focal area of conscious rats induced a classical, reversible general anesthesia-like behavioral state. The authors concluded that this area, termed the mesopontine tegmental anesthesia area (MPTA), may be important for the induction of general anesthesia. The purpose of the present project was to study the neurophysiological basis of the analgesia, which accompanied the state of general anesthesia induced by PB microinjections into the MPTA that was reported by (Devor and Zalkind, 2001). Here, sensory inflow via the spinothalamic tract (STT), a classical spinal nociceptive pathway in the rat, was assessed using single neuron extracellular recording techniques before, during and after microinjections of PB into the MPTA.

Spontaneous firing rate (SFR), antidromic firing index (FI) and sciatic as well as sural nerve-evoked responses (Sc-, Su-ER) of STT neurons in isoflurane-anesthetized rats were quantified before as well as 2, 15, 30 and 60 min following bilateral microinjections of either PB (200 micrograms/side) or vehicle control solution (Vh, 1 microliter/side) into the MPTA.

The group mean SFR, FI as well as magnitudes of Sc-, Su-ER of STT neurons were significantly and reversibly reduced following PB microinjections compared to corresponding baseline measurements. There were no significant changes in any of the three parameters following microinjections of Vh compared to the pre-microinjection baseline responses.

The results from this study indicate that analgesia, which occurs during the anesthesia-like state following microinjections of PB into the MPTA, may be due to attenuation of sensory inflow through the STT. The suppression of STT neurons likely occurs via direct and/or indirect descending pathways from the MPTA to the spinal cord. This study provides the first direct electrophysiological evidence for the analgesia caused by PB microinjections into the rat MPTA.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Many regional and local factors can influence the distribution of native and exotic species in ecological communities. I examined the regional- and local-scale determinants of native and exotic vascular plant species richness and composition in a highly fragmented oak savanna ecosystem on southeastern Vancouver Island. In sharp contrast to most reported results, I found a negative relationship between native and exotic richness at the regional scale, and no relationship at the local scale. Two extrinsic factors, surrounding road density and climate, best explained the regional-scale relationship by each affecting natives and exotics in opposite ways. Road density and climate were also the dominant predictors of native and exotic composition at the regional scale. Patterns in the patch occupancy of individual species confirmed the importance of these factors but I found that low surrounding road densities and cool, wet conditions predicted the presence of many natives and the absence of many exotics. Environmental factors explained variation in richness and composition at the local scale, but these factors were different for natives and exotics. My results suggest that natives and exotics respond to roads and climate in fundamentally different ways. Roads increase both exotic propagule pressure and disturbance, which may facilitate exotic invasion. In contrast, disturbance from roads may increase the likelihood of local extinction for particular natives. Differing climatic preferences within the native and exotic species pools may also partially explain the observed patterns. There was no evidence that native diversity directly affects exotic diversity (or vice versa). Surprisingly, I found that connectivity was not an important predictor of richness or composition despite the high degree of habitat fragmentation in this ecosystem.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Crossing out: transgender (in)visibility in twentieth-century culture</dc:title>

<dc:description>Spanning the period from the early years of the Cold War to the early twenty-first century, Crossing Out argues that medical theories of gender variance which emerge in the middle of the twentieth century are bound by the Cold-War–era discursive limits within which they were articulated, and that the ideological content of those theories persists into late-century research and treatment protocols. I parallel these analyses with interrogations of literary representations of transgendered subjects. What emerges most powerfully from this analysis of literary works is their tendency to signify in excess of the medical foreclosures, even when they seem consistent with medical discourse. By reading these two discursive systems against each other, the dissertation demonstrates the ability of literary discourse to accommodate multifaceted subject positions which medical discourse is unable to articulate. Literature thus complicates the stories that medical culture tells, revealing complex and multivariate possibilities for transgendered identification absent from traditional medical accounts. In tracing these discursive intersections the dissertation draws on and extends Michel Foucault’s theory of subjugated knowledges and Judith Butler’s writings on the formation of gendered subjects. 
	Chapter One establishes the Cold War context, and argues that there are significant continuities between 1950s theories of intersexuality and Cold War ideology. Chapter Two extends this analysis to take in theories of transsexualism that emerged in the same years, and analyzes the discursive excesses of a 1950s pulp novel representation of a transsexual. Chapter Three establishes that the ideological content of the medical theories remained virtually unchanged by the 1990s, and argues that multivalent literary representations of transgenderism from the same decade promise the emergence of unanticipated forms of gender identity that exceed medical norms. Chapter Four is concerned with transgendered children, as they are represented in medical writing and in young adult and children’s literature. Interrogating fiction which negotiates between established medical discourse and an emergent transgender discourse, the chapter argues that these works at once invite and subvert a pathologizing understanding of gender-variant children while simultaneously providing data that demands to be read through the lens of an emergent affirmative notion of trans-childhood.</dc:description>

<dc:title>A stakeholder approach to understanding the role of the Olympic Games in social development</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Chauhan, Paramjot Singh</dc:creator>
<dc:subject>Olympics</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>Stakeholder management</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Critics of the Olympic Games argue that rather than promoting the cherished values of Olympism, the Games have primarily been used as a means to leverage public funds to satisfy the economic interests of the elite, while typically returning to the community overdebtness of hosting the event, unusable post event facilities and negative impacts to accommodations and its resident’s standard of living  (Andranovich, Burbank &amp; Heying, 2001; Haxton, 1999; Hall, 2006; Hiller, 1990, Horne &amp; Manzenreiter, 2006; Lenskyj 2003; Macintosh and Whitson, 1993). 
For Vancouver, host city of the 2010 Winter Olympic Games, to overcome such criticisms the organizing committee must work with its stakeholders, those with a stake rather than stock in the Games, to ensure that social development benefits are maximized and negative impacts are mitigated. The city’s downtown eastside (DTES) has been singled out as the first area of focus by both the Vancouver Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Games (VANOC) and the Vancouver Agreement (VA), a public collaboration aimed at addressing the social issues that plague the area including business decline, unemployment, poverty, crime, and drug use (Ference &amp; Weicker, 2002; Pivot, 2006; Vancouver Agreement, 2006). The 2010 Winter Games Inner-City Inclusive Commitment Statement (ICICS), adopted by VANOC and the VA, outlines the goal for an inclusive and socio–economic responsible Games. Understanding how each organization aims to use these Olympic Games to address the social development issues in the DTES was the primary focus of this study. Using stakeholder theory, the specific research questions included:  1) How do the focal organization (VA) and the stakeholders (VANOC) define the social development issue(s) underpinning their involvement in the ICICS? 2) How does VANOC see its role/interests in the VA and how does this compare with the VA’s view of VANOC’s role? 3) What factors are facilitating or constraining the sustainability of the relationship between the VA and VANOC? 4) What outcomes do the VA and VANOC hope to accomplish and how will these be assessed?
This case study from September 2005 to February 2006, used multiple qualitative research methods including document analysis of organizational reports, policies and media releases and purposive sampling to conduct 8 ‘elite’ face to face interviews with administrators from VANOC, the 2010 Legacies Now Society, a non-profit society that works with community partners to develop social and economic opportunities surrounding the 2010 Winter Olympic Games, and those involved at the VA. 
The study revealed the primary goal between these three organizations is to use determine how to effectively use these Olympic Games as a catalyst to address the social issues affecting the DTES. While acknowledging that these social issues will by no means be fully addressed by the time the Games are hosted, they continue to focus on building their relationships and within the community in order to accelerate this social agenda. Factors found to facilitating their own relationship and with the community include: inter organizational dynamics, the Olympic Games sectoral tables, and VANOC’s Board of Directors. While administrators also identified factors constraining the relationship to include: managing working relationships with the community, government politics, and inter organizational challenges.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Structural and metamorphic evolution of the Ormsby Zone and relative timing of gold mineralization: a newly defined Archean orogenic gold prospect hosted on the Discovery Property, Yellowknife greenstone belt, Slave Province, Canada</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Whitty, William H. R.</dc:creator>
<dc:subject>Northwest Territories</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>geology</dc:subject>
<dc:description>The Yellowknife greenstone belt has produced approximately 14 million ounces of gold, 13 of which came from the well explored southern half of the belt. The northern half of the belt, where the Discovery Property (1 million ounce past producer) is located, is not as well explored, but geologically very similar to the gold producing southern half. Gold on the Discovery Property, Northwest Territories, has been historically mined from a quartz vein formed adjacent to Archean metabasaltic bodies enclosed in metasedimentary rocks. Some of the metasedimentary rocks are correlated to the Archean Banting Group, based on a U-Pb age of 2.66 Ga on zircon (SHRIMP-RG). The metabasalt is correlated to the Banting Group based on its deposition relationship with the adjacent metasedimentary rocks. The Banting Group is present in the Yellowknife greenstone belt, located near the well-known Con and Giant Mines near Yellowknife, 90 km to the south. 

The two gold deposits forming the Discovery Property contains almost 2 million ounces in past production and current resources. The historical Discovery Mine was developed in quartz veins hosted in the metasedimentary rocks folded around the northern tip of one of the metabasalt bodies. In contrast, the newly defined Ormsby Zone consists of gold in silicified and sulphidized domains within metamorphosed pillowed and brecciated mafic volcanic rocks, and shares many characteristics with other Archean Orogenic gold deposits. Pyrrhotite ± arsenopyrite is directly correlated with the gold-bearing zones. Gold is also associated with pyrite and retrograde phases of chlorite, sericite and carbonate.

Through detailed outcrop mapping and petrography the history of structural and metamorphic events are sequenced and the relative time of gold mineralization placed into the geological framework.

Peak-metamorphic mineral assemblages on the property record upper greenschist to amphibolite facies conditions. Rocks on the Discovery Property have undergone at least four foliation-forming, deformational events. Three generations of folding are described, as well as a vertical lineation across the property. Gold mineralization occurred post-ductile fabric forming deformation, post-peak metamorphism, and syn-retrograde metamorphism. Although no visible evidence was observed mapping, metamorphic data present the possibility of a regional scale fault separating two metamorphic domains on the property.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Farewell in the Garden is a Qing dynasty (1644-1911) copy of a parting gift painted by Wen Zhengming (1470-1559) for his student Wang Chong (1494-1533) to mark the occasion of Wang Chong’s visit before he left to write the civil service examination. In addition to this painting, three other versions bearing similar poetic inscriptions exist.  These four paintings present an intriguing riddle and oppourtunity to consider copies as works worthy of scholarly attention. The compelling scene of farewell between teacher and student who both failed the examinations numerous times resonated with audiences who empathized with their disappointments. A longing to serve in the government is visible when these paintings are considered in relation to earlier literati art. The sketch-like traces of a ledge that is in all of the copies except Farewell in the Garden, hint to the visual possibility of this scene being situated on a shore. Wen Zhengming, through his subtle lines, alludes to this powerful site of parting which is frequently depicted in literati landscape painting and associated with scholar officials and men of merit. 
This thesis situates Farewell in the Garden and its copies within the wider tradition of literati painting through the theme of service. Government service, as a Confucian ideal, and as a recurring theme in literati painting, transforms in appearance over time, reflecting political, economic, and philosophical shifts. In the Ming dynasty, the ideal of service is manifest and demonstrated in the continued pursuit to serve in office, and the garden, reminiscent of the locations depicted in literati painting, becomes a suitable setting for this enactment. I argue that this parting scene of Wen Zhengming and Wang Chong came to implicitly represent the commitment to serve in government. The cogent Confucian ideal demonstrated by teacher and student is the unyielding determination to serve, and it is this very sentiment or quality in the copies of the farewell painting – the tenacious endeavour to be of service – that is at once consoling and persuasive.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Particleboard (PB) is a widely used panel material because of its physical properties and low cost. Unfortunately, cutting can degrade its surface creating rejects and increasing manufacturing costs. A major challenge is PB’s internal variability.  Different particle and glue bond strength combinations can sometimes create high quality surfaces in one area and defects such as edge chipping in nearby areas.   

This research examines methods of improving surface quality by examining PB characteristics and their interactions with the cutting tool. It also develops an analytical model and software tool that allows the effects of these factors to be simulated, thereby giving practical guidance and reducing the need for costly experiments.   When PB is cut and the glue bond strength is weaker than the particle strength, particles are pulled out, leading to surface defects.  When instead the glue bond strength is stronger than the particle strength, particles are smoothly cut, leading to a high quality surface.  

PB is modeled as a matrix of particles each with stochastically assigned material and glue bond strengths. The PB model is layered allowing particles to be misaligned. Voids are modeled as missing particles.

PB cutting is modeled in three zones. In the finished material and tool tip zones, particles are compressed elastically and then crushed at constant stress. After failure, chip formation occurs in the chip formation zone. At large rake angles, the chip is modeled as a transversely loaded beam that can fail by cleavage at its base or tensile failure on its surface. At small rake angles, the chip is modeled as the resultant force acting on the plane from the tool tip through to the panel surface.  

Experimental and simulation results show that cutting forces increase with depth of cut, glue content and particle strength. They decrease with rake angle. Glue bond strength can be increased to the equivalent particle strength through the selection of particle geometry and the subsequent increased glue bond efficiency, which increases the cut surface quality without the need for additional glue. Minimizing the size and frequency of voids and using larger rake angles can also increase surface quality.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Numerous studies have demonstrated that tumour cells have the ability to alter immune function to create an immune suppressed environment. This allows tumour cells to escape immune surveillance and consequently the tumour can progress. Dendritic and T cells have critical roles in immune activation and tolerance and are thus major targets of tumour-mediated immune suppression. Understanding the mechanism(s) by which tumour cells modulate the immune system will facilitate the development of immune system-based therapies for cancer treatments. In this study we sought to determine the nature of, and cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying, changes in immune status during tumour progression using mouse models of prostate cancer. 

Detailed analysis of the immunological status in a mouse prostate dysplasia model (12T-7slow) revealed that immune suppression accompanied tumour progression. We found that T cells isolated from tumour-bearing hosts were hypo-responsive to antigen stimulation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells were responsible, at least in part, for this alteration. Anti-CD25 antibody treatment reduced, but did not prevent, tumour growth in either a transplanted prostate tumour model or a spontaneously developing prostate tumour model. In addition, an altered dendritic cell phenotype and an elevated frequency of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells were observed within the tumour mass. Similar alterations were observed in the prostate-specific Pten knockout mice which develop advanced prostate adenocarcinoma. Interestingly, evidence of immune activation, such as an increased frequency of activated T cells, was detected in the tumour microenvironment in both mouse prostate tumour models. 

To identify factors that may play critical roles in the altered immune cell phenotype observed in the tumour microenvironment, a global gene expression profiling analysis was carried out to evaluate the changes in immune-related gene expression patterns. This analysis provided additional evidence for the co-existence of immune suppression and immune activation. Moreover, subsequent analyses suggested that one differentially expressed transcript, interferon regulatory factor 7, and its target genes might be involved in modulating immune cells and/or tumour progression. 

Taken together, these studies have important implications for designing specific and effective anti-tumour immune therapy strategies that involve manipulation of tumour cells, dendritic cells and regulatory T cells.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Linear mixed effects models in functional data analysis</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Wang, Wei</dc:creator>
<dc:subject>functional regression</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>mixed models</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Regression models with a scalar response and 
a functional predictor have been extensively 
studied. One approach is to approximate the 
functional predictor using basis function or 
eigenfunction expansions. In the expansion, 
the coefficient vector can either be fixed or 
random. The random coefficient vector 
is also known as random effects and thus the 
regression models are in a mixed effects 
framework.

The random effects provide a model for the 
within individual covariance of the 
observations. But it also introduces an 
additional parameter into the model, the 
covariance matrix of the random effects. 
This additional parameter complicates the 
covariance matrix of the observations.
Possibly, the covariance parameters of the 
model are not identifiable.  

We study identifiability in normal linear 
mixed effects models. We derive necessary and 
sufficient conditions of identifiability,
particularly, conditions of identifiability 
for the regression models with a scalar 
response and a functional predictor using 
random effects.

We study the regression model using the
eigenfunction expansion approach with random 
effects. We assume the random effects have a 
general covariance matrix
and the observed values of the predictor are
contaminated with measurement error.
We propose methods of inference for the 
regression model's functional coefficient. 

As an application of the model, we analyze a 
biological data set to investigate the 
dependence of a mouse's wheel running 
distance on its body mass trajectory.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Regulation of plant innate immunity: the role of protein import and the novel MOS4-associated complex</dc:title>

<dc:subject>protein import</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Plants have evolved sophisticated defence systems against pathogen infection. Initiation of induced defence signalling often involves specific recognition of invading pathogens by the products of specialized host Resistance (R) genes. Consequently, the pathogen is stopped at the site of infection. A unique dominant mutant in Arabidopsis thaliana, snc1, constitutively expresses pathogensis-related (PR) genes and exhibits enhanced resistance to bacterial and oomycete pathogens. SNC1 encodes an R-gene – a single amino acid change renders this protein constitutively active without interaction with pathogens. snc1 displays a stunted phenotype that may be caused by both the accumulation of toxic compounds and energy squandered on unnecessary defence instead of normal growth. The distinctive morphological phenotype of snc1 is intimately associated with the other resistance phenotypes, and provides a robust genetic tool for dissecting the signalling events downstream of snc1.
To identify genes important for defence signalling, we carried out a suppressor screen to identify modifier of snc1 (mos) mutants that restore the wild type size and morphology in the snc1 background. Furthermore, in most cases, a loss of sneakiness in mos mutants correlated with a reduced or abolished constitutive PR gene expression, SA accumulation and pathogen resistance in snc1 plants. These loss of function mutants represent defects in positive regulators of the snc1 pathway. I cloned and characterized two mos mutants, and showed that they both have roles in Arabidopsis innate immunity as well. 
 mos6 partially suppresses snc1 and exhibits enhanced disease susceptibility (EDS) to an oomycete pathogen. MOS6, identified by map-based cloning, encodes an alpha-importin subunit, one of 8 found in Arabidopsis, and has a demonstrated role in nucleocytoplasmic partitioning (protein import). Two other genes cloned by others from this screen, MOS3 and MOS7, encode components of the nuclear pore complex, implicating nuclear trafficking as a key regulator in plant innate immunity.
mos4 exhibits EDS to virulent and avirulent bacterial and oomycete pathogens. There is evidence that MOS4-mediated resistance is independent of the signalling protein NPR1. MOS4 encodes a protein with homology to human Breast Cancer Amplified Sequence 2 and with predicted protein-protein interaction domains. Subcellular localization of MOS4-GFP shows that MOS4 is localized to the nucleus. To illuminate the biochemical function of MOS4, a yeast-2-hybrid screen was conducted. One MOS4-interactor was a putative myb transcription factor, MOS4-Associated Complex Protein 1 (MAC1), also known at AtCDC5. MAC1 interacts directly with MOS4 in vitro and in planta. mac1 insertional mutants exhibit defects in immune responses to pathogens similar to that of mos4. In addition, mac1 also partially suppressed snc1 morphology and enhanced resistance.
Both MOS4 and MAC1 have homologs in humans and fission yeast that are members of a discrete protein complex that has been implicated in several different biological processes including RNA splicing, apoptosis and protein degradation. Using proteomics data from yeast and human, we found genes with homology to additional components of the orthologous complex in Arabidopsis, and isolated insertion mutants in these. Mutations in PRL1, which encodes a WD protein, display similar disease phenotypes to that of mos4 and mac1. AtCDC5 has DNA binding activity, suggesting that this complex may regulate defence responses through transcriptional control. Since the complex components along with their interactions are highly conserved from fission yeast to Arabidopsis and human, they may also have a yet-to-be identified function in mammalian innate immunity.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>Musical Engagement</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>Social Responsibility</dc:subject>
<dc:description>This study explores the role engagement in a school-based music ensemble plays in the development of social responsibility in middle school students. The study involved 9 music students, 18 non-music students, and 5 teachers at a suburban middle school in Coquitlam, B.C. Students were compared using three measures – office referral data, a Social Responsibility Quick Scale, and a moral dilemma writing activity – and were subsequently interviewed to determine their thoughts on how musical engagement in music classes might impact their development of social responsibility. Interviews with teachers focused on activities that they believe foster social responsibility as well as their perspectives on this area of child development. Students are referred to the office for misbehaviour at school, and office referral data for the entire school population revealed that students in music classes are referred significantly less often than students not engaged in music (males p = .001; females p = .005). Musically engaged students achieved higher assessed scores on the Social Responsibility Quick Scale and the moral dilemma activity, but the statistical significance of these relationships is questionable owing to the small sample size. Interviews with students and teachers suggested that public performance, music teacher mentorship, and shared in-group responsibilities contribute to fostering development of social responsibility in music students.</dc:description>

<dc:title>A molecular approach to study the monoterpene-induced response in Arabidopsis thaliana</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Godard, Kimberley-Ann</dc:creator>
<dc:subject>Inter-plant communication</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>Terpene induced responses</dc:subject>
<dc:description>A wound- and insect-inducible expression system for transgenic plants was developed. Specifically, I demonstrate wound- and insect-inducible, localized gene expression driven by the potato proteinase inhibitor II (pinII)-promoter in transformed Arabidopsis, tobacco and white spruce. As reporter and target genes driven by the pinII-promoter, I used the GUS gene and a terpenoid synthase gene, respectively. In addition, I found that the pinII-promoter drives trichome-specific, systemically-induced gene expression in tobacco and Arabidopsis. Finally, I demonstrate that the pinII–promoter, when transformed into Arabidopsis, is extremely sensitive to subtle, low-impact stress treatment.
This latter finding prompted me to use, in the second part of my thesis, the pinII-promoter in conjunction with GUS reporter gene expression to test if intact Arabidopsis plants can respond to exposure to monoterpene volatiles. My experiments using the pinII–promoter GUS reporter system clearly established that Arabidopsis plants respond to the exposure of the monoterpene volatiles tested. It is thought that monoterpenes and other volatiles can act as airborne signals between plants under stress or between distant parts of the same plant. At the outset of my thesis research, and to some extent still today, the concept of plant-plant signalling with volatiles has been met with scepticism. After establishing that Arabidopsis plants do respond in a laboratory setting to certain monoterpene volatiles, I further tested the extent of the response at the transcriptome level using a 30 K microarray platform. The gene expression analysis revealed several hundred transcripts that respond with a change of abundance in response to treatment of intact Arabidopsis plants with the monoterpenes ocimene or myrcene. Many of these transcripts were annotated as stress and defense genes including genes involved in octadecanoid signaling. Real-time PCR analyses of octadecanoid mutants confirmed a role for octadecanoid signaling in the response to the monoterpene ocimene. In addition, treatment with ocimene or myrcene caused increased levels of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) in Arabidopsis rosette leaves. However, plants treated with monoterpene prior to wounding or feeding by cabbage looper did not reveal any significant priming effect for these pre-treatments.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Variable speed drive technology has advanced dramatically in the last 10 years with the advent of new power devices. In this study, a three phase induction motor drive using Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBT) at the inverter power stage is introduced to implement speed and position control for the revolving stage in the Frederic Wood Theatre 
This thesis presents a solution to control a 3-phase induction motor using the Texas Instruments (TI) Digital Signal Processor (DSP) TMS320F2407A. The use of this DSP yields enhanced operations, fewer system components, lower system cost and increased efficiency. The control algorithm is based on the constant volts-per-hertz principle because the exact speed control is not needed. Reflective object sensors which are mounted on concrete frame are used to detect accurate edge position of revolving stage. The sinusoidal voltage waveforms are generated by the DSP using the space vector modulation technique. 
In order to satisfy some operating conditions for safe and agreeable operation, a look-up table, which is used to give command voltage and speed signals in software, is applied to limit the maximum speed and acceleration of the revolving stage. Meanwhile, a boost voltage signal is added at the low frequency areas to make the motor produce maximum output torque when starting.  
A test prototype is then built to validate the performance. Several tests are implemented into the IGBT drive to explore the reason for unacceptable oscillations in IGBT’s gate control signals. Improvement methods in hardware layout are suggested for the final design.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Determining the physical and biological habitat variables that influence the abundance of juvenile salmonids in British Columbia streams will improve management practices. Habitat models are tools that provide insight into organisms’ habitat needs and provide a more efficient mechanism for estimating population abundance than direct measurement. Models have been developed for salmonids in other jurisdictions, but very few have included invertebrate drift (a primary food source for juvenile salmonids) as a predictive variable. This is because temporal and spatial variation of drift abundance are widely assumed to be so high that drift cannot be reliably estimated without unreasonable effort. This thesis investigates the temporal and spatial variability of invertebrate drift and the impact of its inclusion in habitat models for juvenile salmonid abundance in two chapters. The first objective of the first chapter was to evaluate the temporal variability of invertebrate drift by comparing the seasonal and day-to-day variation in drift abundance to spatial variation within and between sites. The second objective was to develop predictive models for invertebrate drift abundance. Aquatic, terrestrial and total invertebrate drift abundances varied primarily between sites and very little between days or months at the same site, indicating that a single day of sampling is sufficient to assess drift abundance for comparison among sites. The abundance of invertebrate drift was related to productivity- and flow-related habitat variables. The objectives of the second chapter were to develop predictive models for juvenile salmonid abundance in southwestern BC using physical and biological habitat variables, to determine whether habitat variables differ between the Coast and Interior regions of BC, to determine the contribution of invertebrate drift to the relative predictive ability of the models, and to determine cost:benefit ratios for the predictive models and their component variables. The final models for predicting abundance of all young-of-year salmonids combined, and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and coho salmon (O. kisutch) individually, included variables related to stream structure and productivity, and the models for rainbow and coho showed regional differences. Invertebrate drift did not improve model fit.</dc:description>

<dc:title>The role of CD43 in the growth and pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis within the mammalian host</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Randhawa, April Kaur</dc:creator>
<dc:subject>Tuberculosis</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>CD43</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Mycobacterium tuberculosis exploits various molecules on host cells to gain entry and establish a niche for survival and replication. We characterized the role of the glycoprotein CD43 in the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis. Using gene-deleted mice (CD43-/-), we assessed association of the bacterium with macrophages and found that CD43 was required for optimal binding of M. tuberculosis strain Erdman by splenic, peritoneal, alveolar, and bone marrow-derived macrophages. Macrophages from heterozygote (CD43+/-) mice, which express 50% less CD43 than wild type (CD43+/+) mice, bound more bacteria than CD43-/- but less than CD43+/+ indicating that the surface expression of CD43 correlates with binding of M. tuberculosis. The role of CD43 in binding bacteria may be restricted to mycobacterial species as CD43-/- macrophages also bound less Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, but there was no observed role in the binding of Salmonella typhimurium or Listeria monocytogenes. Although absence of CD43 resulted in decreased binding of M. tuberculosis, the subsequent growth of the bacterium within CD43-/- macrophages was enhanced as illustrated by increased bacterial numbers and decreased doubling times, indicating that that the mechanism of entry may influence subsequent.  
	To elucidate mechanisms by which CD43 controls of growth of M. tuberculosis, we examined the induction of antimycobacterial activities.  In response to M. tuberculosis, CD43-/- macrophages were deficient in the production of nitric oxide, TNF-⍺, and IL-12. Furthermore, M. tuberculosis induced less apoptosis, but more necrosis, in CD43-/- macrophages compared to CD43+/+. The enhanced growth of M. tuberculosis was abrogated by IFN-Ɣ-stimulation with whereas addition of TNF-⍺ restored both the intracellular growth rates and amounts of apoptosis to wild type levels. 
	To investigate the role of CD43 in vivo, we infected CD43-/- and CD43+/+ mice with M. tuberculosis and assessed bacterial loads and organ pathology. Absence of CD43 resulted in increased bacterial loads in lungs and spleens during both acute and chronic stages of infection, and formation of granulomas occurred more quickly in CD43-/- mice. These data point to a dual role for CD43 in the uptake and subsequent growth of M. tuberculosis in macrophages and mice.</dc:description>

<dc:title>The role of Mullerian differentiation in epithelial ovarian carcinogenesis</dc:title>

<dc:description>Ovarian cancer is a fatal disease because of the lack of symptoms and markers for early detection.  Most ovarian neoplasms resemble and are classified according to the complex characteristics of Mullerian duct epithelia.  We tested the hypothesis that Mullerian epithelial characteristics influence early ovarian neoplastic progression.
The most common type of ovarian cancer is the serous carcinoma which resembles Mullerian-derived oviductal epithelium.  We discovered that oviduct-specific glycoprotein (OVGP1), a tubal differentiation marker, was present in inclusion cysts, which are the preferential sites for malignant transformation, and in most low grade serous tumors, but absent in ovarian surface epithelium and most high grade carcinomas.  OVGP1 was almost entirely limited to ovarian neoplasms with the notable exception of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma.  A new antibody against OVGP1 detected elevated serum levels from most women with low grade ovarian cancers compared to normal controls.  OVGP1 also identified a subset of patients with high grade serous carcinomas who had a more favorable outcome. 
To examine whether the differentiated phenotype of early ovarian neoplasms alters invasiveness, we established the first permanent cell line for serous borderline ovarian tumors (SBOT), which are differentiated but noninvasive.  The results revealed a striking phenotypic similarity between two lines regardless of their cytogenetic diversity.  They retained Mullerian epithelial characteristics in vitro, as demonstrated by their morphologic appearance and the differentiation markers keratin, E-cadherin, CA125 and OVGP1.  Neither disruption of the growth pattern nor manipulations of the cadherin profile induced invasivenesss.  Induction of invasiveness by SV40 early genes was associated with a loss in morphologic differentiation and of differentiation markers but increased motility.  MMP secretion was independent of the invasion status.  
Our findings indicate that OVGP1 is an indicator of early ovarian epithelial neoplasia.  It can be detected in the sera from women with early ovarian cancer, and thus, may be a new promising diagnostic marker for the early detection of ovarian cancer.  In addition, the results show that Mullerian differentiation does not directly prevent invasiveness, but it diminishes in parallel with invasion caused by other factors.  The lack of invasiveness by SBOT cells may depend on factors that regulate motility.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Street network connectivity and local travel behaviour:  assessing the relationship of travel outcomes to disparate pedestrian and vehicular street network connectivity</dc:title>

<dc:description>This research investigated the association of street network connectivity differences across travel modes with travel behaviour – mode choice, distance traveled and number of trips.  To date research on travel behaviour relationships with urban form has not developed empirical evidence on street designs as distinct networks for walking and driving.
    
A street network having greater connectivity and continuity for the pedestrian mode of travel vis-à-vis the vehicular network, like the Fused Grid, will likely encourage more walking.  This hypothesis was investigated using a quasi-experimental approach within a rational utility behavioural framework.  Local travel behaviour is theorized to be affected by desire to access goods and services (broadly termed, ‘activities’) in the community where people live.  Using inferential statistics, the research tested for relationships between measured street patterns and self-reported local travel by King County, WA households.  The main variables were ratios (walking : driving) of network connectivity and density, in the vicinity of travel survey households.  Demographics and household characteristics, as well as other behaviourally influential urban form factors (residential density, proximity of destinations, etc.), were included in regression models, allowing control for confounding factors.

Findings suggest that street networks with connectivity that provides better routing for one mode of transportation over others encourage more travel by the favored mode.  The regression model demonstrated that a change from a pure small-block grid to a modified grid (i.e. Fused Grid) can result in an 11.3% increase in odds of a home-based trip being walked.  The modified street pattern like a Fused Grid is also associated with a 25.9% increase, over street patterns with equivalent route directness for walking and driving, in the odds a person will meet recommended levels of physical activity.  Finally, the Fused Grid’s 10% increase in relative connectivity for pedestrians is associated with a 23% decrease in local vehicle travel distance (VMT), and its improved continuity is associated with increased walking trips and distance.

Conclusions:
Other factors being equal, residential street networks with either more direct routing for pedestrians or more pedestrian facilities relative to vehicular network are associated with improved odds of walking and reduced odds of driving.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Evolution of copper-containing nitrite reductase</dc:title>
<dc:creator>MacPherson, Iain</dc:creator>
<dc:subject>protein engineering</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>directed evolution</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Copper-containing nitrite reductase (NiR) is a homotrimer of two cupredoxin domains and catalyzes the single electron reduction of NO2- to NO during dissimilatory denitrification. To investigate the evolution of NiR, methods of mutagenic library generation and high-throughput variant screening from E. coli colonies were developed. These methods allow for facile screening of 105 mutants for folding efficiency or substrate specificity. Initial proof of principle studies yielded several variants that oxidized the artificial substrate ο-dianisidine up to 8 times faster than wild type NiR, suggesting that this methodology has the potential to engineer NiR to acquire other reductase functions.

      A crystal structure was solved for a putative multicopper oxidase (MCO) and NiR homologue from Arthrobacter sp. (AMMCO) to 1.8 Å resolution. The overall folds of AMMCO and NiR are very similar (r.m.s.d. of 2.0 Å over 250 Cα atoms); Like NiR, AMMCO is a trimer with type-1 Cu sites in the N-terminal domain of each monomer; however, the active site of AMMCO contains trinuclear Cu site characteristic of MCOs instead of a the mononuclear type-2 Cu site found in NiR. Detailed structural analysis supports the theory that two-domain MCOs similar to AMMCO were intermediaries in the evolution of NiR and the more common three-domain MCOs. The physiological function of AMMCO remains uncertain, but genomic, crystallographic and functional analysis suggests that the enzyme is involved in metal regulation. 

      Considering the extensive similarity between AMMCO and NiR, particularly at the active site, engineering a trinuclear cluster into NiR appears feasible with a modest number of alterations to the polypeptide chain. With the aid of my newly developed high-throughput screening technique and site-directed mutagenesis, the mononuclear NiR active site was remodelled into a trinuclear Cu site similar to that of MCO. A crystal structure of this variant was solved to 2.0 Å and the presence of three copper atoms at the engineered cluster was confirmed by Cu-edge anomalous diffraction data. Although the trinuclear copper cluster is present and catalyzes the reduction of oxygen, achieving rates of catalysis seen in native MCOs has proven more difficult. With the framework provided, further engineering NiR into a robust MCO is likely to provide further insights into the structural basis of oxygen reduction by trinuclear copper sites.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>primary health care</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>social isolation</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Accessibility is a key tenet of the Canadian health care system. As many older persons, age 60 years and older, are managing ongoing chronic health conditions as part of their everyday lives, issues of access to health services are particularly important. Vancouver has a substantial number of older Korean immigrants, yet little is known about their experience and perceptions about accessing Primary Health Care (PHC) services. This study explored issues related to PHC access by older (aged 60 years and older) Korean immigrants. This qualitative study employed purposive sampling and interpretive description methodology. Open-ended interview data and field notes were gathered from 10 older Korean immigrants (five male and five female) recruited in Vancouver from mid-October 2006 to April 2007. 
The findings revealed that older Korean immigrants have had difficulty gaining access to appropriate PHC services because of the shifts in their social positioning and other barriers which contributed to an inappropriate use of PHC services, delays in care and lack of continuity in PHC. Also, the data revealed a number of ways the PHC system is unresponsive to the health care needs of older Korean immigrants. This study offers insights that may assist health care professionals to understand the nature of the challenges older Korean immigrants face when seeking health care and how they seek to resolve them. The analysis proposes a number of interventions that respect the older Korean immigrants’ values and interventions that may improve their access to PHC.</dc:description>

<dc:title>The evidence is in the telling: the words of women survivors of non-physical abuse in intimate partner relationships</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Poirier, Judith</dc:creator>
<dc:subject>Woman abuse</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Woman Abuse is recognized as a serious issue that is epidemic in Canadian
society; women of any ethnicity, race, education, and socio-economic status are at risk.
Although non-physical abuse is harmful, in the absence of physical abuse, it is often
overlooked or minimized by potential helpers. Consequently, in the absence of physical
abuse, understanding that the abuse is unacceptable and requires action, and having the
abuse taken seriously by potential helpers, is more difficult. The purpose of this study
was to better understand how women who have experienced non-physical abuse in an
intimate partner relationship use language to describe, interpret, and evaluate their
experiences, and how they communicate their understanding to others.
In this qualitative study, the narrative method was used to examine how women
use language to make meaning from their abuse experiences tempered by current
personal, family, sociocultural, and environmental norms. Five women who self-identified as having experienced non-physical abuse in an intimate partner relationship
participated in this study.
Data analysis of in-depth interviews included an examination of the telling of the
narrative, then an analysis of form and subsequent graphic depiction of the overall
structure of the narrative. The content analysis that followed derived six overarching
themes that formed the basis for new understanding in four key areas: categorization of
abuse constrains understanding for women survivors of abuse and potential helpers; the
evidence is in the telling: listening creates connection and enables recognition of abuse
across categories; recognition of the state of “Death” of Self clarifies and deepens
understanding of the impact of abuse; and education, employment, and support networks
can mediate the effects of abuse.
The findings emphasize the need to view all forms of abuse as abuse, and to view
women who may be experiencing abuse in intimate partner relationships as capable,
competent, and worthy. Connection and engagement is a vital step to providing access to
care and support, and the most helpful interventions for women who experience non-physical abuse in intimate partner relationships may be those that are decided upon
collaboratively with the woman, when the potential helper chooses to listen first.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The membrane bioreactor (MBR) is becoming increasingly popular for wastewater treatment, mainly due to its capability of producing high quality effluent with a relatively small footprint. However, high plant maintenance and operating costs due to membrane fouling limit the wide spread application of MBRs. Membrane fouling generally depends on the interactions between the membrane and, the activated sludge mixed liquor, which in turn, are affected by the chosen operating conditions. The present research study aimed to explore the process performance and membrane fouling in the membrane enhanced biological phosphorus removal (MEBPR) process under different operating conditions by, (1) comparing two MEBPRs operated in parallel, one with constant inflow and another with a variable inflow, and by, (2) operating the MEBPRs with different solids retention times (SRT).&#xd;
&#xd;
On-line filtration experiments were conducted simultaneously in both MEBPR systems by using test membrane modules. From the transmembrane pressure (TMP) data of the test membrane modules, it was revealed that fouling propensities of the MEBPR mixed liquors were similar in both parallel reactors under the operating conditions applied, although the fouling propensity of the aerobic mixed liquors of both reactors increased when the SRT of the reactors was reduced.&#xd;
&#xd;
Routinely monitored reactor performance data suggest that an MEBPR process with a varying inflow (dynamic operating condition) performs similarly to an MEBPR process with steady operating conditions at SRTs of 10 days and 20 days. Mixed liquor characterization tests were conducted, including critical flux, capillary suction time (CST), time to filter (TTF) and, bound and soluble extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) were quantified, to evaluate their role on membrane fouling. The tests results suggest that the inflow variation in an MEBPR process did not make a significant difference in any of the measured parameters. &#xd;
&#xd;
With decreased SRT, an increase in the concentrations of EPS was observed, especially the bound protein, and the bound and soluble humic-like substances. This suggests that these components of activated sludge mixed liquors may be related to membrane fouling. No clear relationship was observed between membrane fouling and other measured parameters, including critical flux, normalized CST and normalized TTF.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy options for proton exchange membrane fuel cell diagnostics</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Valenzuela, Jorge Ignacio</dc:creator>
<dc:subject>impedance</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>diagnostic</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has been exploited as a rich source of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) diagnostic information for many years.  Several investigators have characterized different failure modes for PEMFCs using EIS and it now remains to determine how this information is to be obtained and used in a diagnostic or control algorithm for an operating PEMFC.
This work utilizes the concept of impedance spectral fingerprints (ISF) to uniquely identify between failure modes in an operating PEMFC.  Three well documented PEMFC failure modes, carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning, dehydration, and flooding were surveyed, modelled, and simulated in the time domain and the results were used to create a database of ISFs.  The time domain simulation was realized with a fractional order differential calculus state space approach.
A primary goal of this work was to develop simple and cost effective algorithms that could be included in a PEMFC on-board controller.  To this end, the ISF was discretized as coarsely as possible while still retaining identifying spectral features using the Goertzel algorithm in much the same way as in dual tone multi-frequency detection in telephony.  This approach generated a significant reduction in computational burden relative to the classical Fast Fourier Transform approach.  
The ISF database was used to diagnose simulated experimental PEMFC failures into one of five levels of failure: none (normal operation), mild, moderate, advanced, and extreme from one of the three catalogued failure modes.  The described ISF recognition algorithm was shown to correctly identify failure modes to a lower limit of SNR =  1dB.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Assisting bug report triage through recommendation</dc:title>

<dc:description>A key collaborative hub for many software development projects is the issue tracking system, or bug repository. The use of a bug repository can improve the software development process in a number of ways including allowing developers who are geographically distributed to communicate about project development. However, reports added to the repository need to be triaged by a human, called the triager, to determine if reports are meaningful. If a report is meaningful, the triager decides how to organize the report for integration into the project's development process. We call triager decisions with the goal of determining if a report is meaningful, repository-oriented decisions, and triager decisions that organize reports for the development process, development-oriented decisions.

Triagers can become overwhelmed by the number of reports added to the repository. Time spent triaging also typically diverts valuable resources away from the improvement of the product to the managing of the development process. To assist triagers, this dissertation presents a machine learning approach to create recommenders that assist with a variety of development-oriented decisions. In this way, we strive to reduce human involvement in triage by moving the triager's role from having to gather information to make a decision to that of confirming a suggestion.

This dissertation introduces a triage-assisting recommender creation process that can create a variety of different development-oriented decision recommenders for a range of projects. The recommenders created with this approach are accurate: recommenders for which developer to assign a report have a precision of 70% to 98% over five open source projects, recommenders for which product component the report is for have a recall of 72% to 92%, and recommenders for who to add to the cc: list of a report that have a recall of 46% to 72%. We have evaluated recommenders created with our triage-assisting recommender creation process using both an analytic evaluation and a field study. In addition, we present in this dissertation an approach to assist project members to specify the project-specific values for the triage-assisting recommender creation process, and show that such recommenders can be created with a subset of the repository data.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Sulfide stress cracking resistance of API-X100 high strength low alloy steel in H2S environments</dc:title>

<dc:description>Sulfide Stress Cracking (SSC) resistance of the newly developed API-X100 High Strength Low Alloy (HSLA) steel was investigated in the NACE TM0177 "A" solution. The NACE TM0177 "A" solution is a hydrogen sulfide (H2S) saturated solution containing 5.0 wt.% sodium chloride (NaC1) and 0.5 wt.% acetic acid (CH3COOH). The aim of this thesis was to study the effect of microstructure, non-metallic inclusions and alloying elements of the X100 on H2S corrosion and SSC susceptibility. The study was conducted by means of electrochemical polarization techniques and constant load (proof ring) testing. Microstructural analysis and electrochemical polarization results for X100were compared with those for X80, an older generation HSLA steel. Uniaxial constant load SSC testing was conducted using X100 samples and the results were compared with those reported for older generation HSLA steels.

Addition of H2S to the NACE TM0177 "A" solution increased the corrosion rate of X100from 51.6 to 96.7 mpy. The effect of H2S on the corrosion rate was similar for X80. The corrosion rate for X80 increased from 45.2 to 80.2 mpy when H2S was added to the test solution. Addition of H2S enhanced the anodic kinetics by forming a catalyst (FeHSads) on the metal surface and as a result, shifted the anodic polarization curve to more current densities. Moreover, the cathodic half cell potential increased due to the decrease in pH, from 2.9 to 2.7, which shifted the cathodic polarization curve to more current densities. The increase in both the anodic and cathodic currents, after H2S addition, caused the rise in the corrosion current density.

In H2S saturated NACE TM-0177 "A" solution, the X100 steel corrosion rate was higher than the X80 steel by 20%. Longer phase boundaries and larger nonmetallic inclusions in the X100 microstructure generated more areas with dissimilar corrosion potentials and therefore, a stronger driving force for corrosion. Higher density of second phase regions and larger nonmetallic inclusions acted as an increased cathode area on the X100 surface which increased the cathodic current density and consequently, increased the corrosion current density.

Proof ring tests on the X100 gave a threshold stress value, C5th, of 46% YS, 343.1 MPa(49.7 ksi). The main failure was caused by SSC cracking. SSC nucleated at corrosion pits on the metal surface and microcracks in the metal body and propagated perpendicular to the applied stress. Hydrogen Induced Cracking (HIC) was observed in the X100. HIC cracks nucleated at banded martensite-ferrite interfaces and propagated along the rolling direction parallel to the applied tensile stress through the softer ferrite phase.

When compared to older HSLA grades, the X100 tested in this study had a high SSC susceptibility and therefore, is not be recommended for H2S service applications. The high X100 SSC susceptibility was caused by the material high corrosion rates in H2Smedia which formed corrosion pits that acted as crack initiation sites on the metal surface and provided more hydrogen that migrated into the steel. In addition, the X100
inhomogeneous microstructure provided a high density of hydrogen traps in front of the main crack tip which promoted SSC microcrack formation inside the metal. Microcracks in the metal body connected with the main crack tip that originated from corrosion pits which assisted SSC propagation.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Case study for identification and evaluation of construction innovations: the Hotel Georgia project</dc:title>

<dc:description>Architectural, Engineering and Construction (AEC) projects are becoming more complex in terms of client requirements, stakeholder issues, physical, budget and time constraints, and safety and environmental concerns. These constraints have spawned ad-hoc innovations in some AEC projects, without structured frameworks for their assessment, resulting in varying success for these innovations.

The primary goal of the thesis is to test an existing framework for evaluating innovative design and construction technologies for high-rise buildings by way of a case-study. The case study is a48-story structure (with an 8-level sub-grade parkade) in a downtown setting with significant constraints and challenges. Unlike most other assessment frameworks which are single-issue based (financial, cost, time or risk), a holistic method that captures a broad range of critical issues at the micro and macro levels is used to screen a number of construction innovations. The process highlights the primary difficulty in balancing stakeholder issues, technical/engineering requirements and project goals in assessing the overall feasibility and net benefits of an innovation. As a useful tool, it facilitates the engineering/technical judgment of proposed innovations and provides evidence of a sufficient trade-off between incremental 'cost and benefits' to justify a detailed evaluation and possible subsequent use of a subset of the innovations that passed successfully through a tiered first stage evaluation process.

A secondary objective is to propose appropriate quantitative models for a detailed evaluation of the screened technologies that not only seeks to quantify incremental cost and benefits (e.g. time, increased revenue, etc.) but also assess the level of certainty (in benefits and cost) of innovative construction technologies. An illustrative evaluation provides insights as to the level of modeling and analysis required to evaluate an innovative or novel strategy both at the 'activity/work package' and project levels. The quantum of data required at the pre-construction planning stage coupled with the lack of easy to apply evaluation models probably accounts for the non-prevalence of detailed quantitative evaluation of innovative construction technologies on AEC projects, especially in terms of impact at the project level and the degree of certainty with which net benefits are likely to be achieved.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the goal of developing Schiff base macrocycles with conjugation extended over multiple aromatic rings, new phenanthrene and triphenylene-containing bis(salicylates) were synthesized. A convenient route to 3,6,9,10-tetraalkoxy-2,7-diiodophenanthrene was developed. This compound has been found to be a useful precursor for Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions.

Macrocycles were synthesized by Schiff base condensation of the phenanthrene and triphenylene precursors. Reaction of smaller phenanthrene and triphenylene bis(salicylates) with 1,2-dialkoxy-4,5-phenylenediamine afforded macrocycles in poor yield and purity, but formation of the macrocycle was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Condensation of larger phenanthrene ethynylene bis(salicylates) with phenylenediamines formed [3+3] Schiff base macrocycles in good yield and could be purified through recrystallization. These two large macrocycles were weakly luminescent, and showed decrease in intensity of emission in solution over time. Addition of nitroaromatic compounds to solutions of the macrocycles caused quenching of luminescence, but Stern-Volmer constants could not be determined. One of the macrocycles aggregates in solution and shows some order in the solid state. Association constants for self-assembly of this macrocycle in chloroform were determined, and aggregation was found to be enthalpically driven and entropically disfavoured. Both large macrocycles can complex metals, but low solubility prevents thorough characterization of the metal complexes.

Phenanthrene-containing poly(phenyleneethynylene)s (PPEs) and poly(phenylenevinylene)s (PPVs) were synthesized via the Sonogashira and Heckcouplings, respectively. The PPEs had high molecular weight and both polymers were extremely luminescent with OF = 70% for the PPE and OF = 59% for the PPV. These polymers show potential for use in solar cells and nitroaromatic sensors
.
Dithienylsalphen monomers were made using 4-(2-thienyl)salicylaldehyde and 5-(2-thienyl)salicylaldehyde. These monomers were coordinated to Ni(II), Cu(II) and vanadyl, and tested for electropolymerization. Conjugated dithienylsalphen monomers polymerize poorly, while non-conjugated dithienylsalphen monomers form good films through electropolymerization. Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy confirmed extended conjugation in N,N '-phenylenebis(4-(2-thienyl)salicylideneimine).</dc:description>

<dc:title>The way we see it: an analysis of economically disadvantaged young people's experiences and perceptions of social and economic health in their semi-rural community</dc:title>

<dc:description>This study investigates how socially and economically disadvantaged young people, living in a semi-rural, post-industrial Atlantic Canadian community, experience and perceive social and economic health -- defined as participants' sense of comfort and security that their social and economic needs are, and will continue to be, met in their community. I argue that social and educational policies and practices must reflect the realities of local citizens if they aim to interrupt regional health disparities.

A key objective of this research is to expose and challenge gender, class, and regional inequalities through an analysis of young adults' social and economic health experiences and perceptions. Drawing primarily upon Pierre Bourdieu's (1990b; 2001)concepts -- habitus, field, and symbolic domination -- relations between gender, class,and historical circumstances theoretically inform this research.

Employing a critical ethnographic methodological framework (Madison, 2005),experiences and perceptions of ten economically disadvantaged youth -- five women and five men, ages 19-30 -- were gathered through focus groups, individual interviews, participant observation, critical dialogue (using media to stimulate dialogue among participants), and an adaptation of photovoice (a technique combining photography and narrative).

Results suggest that the social and economic health needs of economically disadvantaged young adults are not being met. They confirm Bourdieu's (1999a)assertion of an interrelationship between physical place and the positioning of agents in social fields. Participants navigate economic, cultural, and social fields, aware of their social positioning as they 'work' the fields in order to secure enough capital to 'get by'. Their struggles are examples of symbolic domination and suggest a significant psycho-social cost to young adults seeking social and economic health through various fields. Analyses of their experiences suggest a disjuncture between gendered identities ascribed to participants through historically-rooted habitus and contemporary social fields.

Recommendations call for gender, class, and regional inequalities to be addressed through structural interventions and investment in long term community-based education that is integrated with local economic development initiatives. Furthermore, this research calls attention to how research agendas and procedures can actually reinforce marginalization, making it difficult for the voices of disadvantaged communities to enter into dominant public discourse.</dc:description>
