<dc:description>Calcific aortic valve sclerosis is characterized by focal lesions in the valve leaflet. These lesions are rich in myofibroblasts that express α-SMA and cause fibrosis. Lesions tend to occur in regions of the leaflet that are subjected to large bending loads, suggesting a mechanobiological basis for myofibrogenic differentiation and valve pathogenesis. In this thesis, a bioreactor was developed to study the effect of physiological loading on myofibrogenic differentiation of valve interstitial cells. Cyclic loading of native porcine aortic valve leaflets ex vivo resulted in increased α-SMA expression, predominantly in the fibrosa and spongiosa (similar to sclerotic leaflets). Cofilin, an actin-binding protein, was also upregulated by loading, suggesting it plays a role in mechanically-induced myofibrogenesis. Similarly, loading of a tissue engineered aortic valve leaflet model resulted in increased α-SMA transcript and protein expression. These data support an integral role for mechanical stimuli in myofibrogenic differentiation and sclerosis in the aortic valve.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background: There are a plethora of potential statistical designs which can be used to evaluate efficacy of a novel cancer treatment in the phase II clinical trial setting. Unfortunately, there is no consensus as to which design one should prefer, nor even which definition of efficacy should be used and the primary endpoint conclusion can vary depending on which design is chosen. It would be useful if an all-encompassing methodology was possible which could evaluate all the different designs simultaneously and allow investigators an understanding of the trial results under the varying scenarios.&#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: Finite Markov chain imbedding is a method which can be used in the setting of phase II oncology clinical trials but never previously evaluated in this scenario. Simple variations to the transition matrix or end-state probability definitions can be performed which allow for evaluation of multiple designs and endpoints for a single trial. A computer program is written in R which allows for computation of p-values and conditional power, two common statistical measures used for evaluation of trial results. A simulation study is performed on data arising from an actual phase II clinical trial performed recently in which the study conclusion regarding the efficacy of the potential treatment was debatable.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results: Finite Markov chain imbedding is shown to be useful for evaluating phase II oncology clinical trial results. The R code written for evaluating the simulation study is demonstrated to be fast and useful for investigating different trial designs. Further detail regarding the clinical trial results are presented, including the potential prolongation of stable disease of the treatment, which is a potentially useful marker of efficacy for this cytostatic agent.&#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions: This novel methodology may prove to be an useful investigative technique for the evaluation of phase II oncology clinical trial data. Future studies which have disputable conclusions might become less controversial with the aid of finite Markov chain imbedding and the possible multiple evaluations which is now viable. Better understanding of activity for a given treatment might expedite the drug development process or help distinguish active from inactive treatments</dc:description>

Many real-world problems do not have a simple &#xd;
&#xd;
algorithmic solution and casting these&#xd;
&#xd;
problems as search problems is often not only &#xd;
&#xd;
the simplest way of casting them, but also&#xd;
&#xd;
the most efficient way of solving them.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis we will present several &#xd;
&#xd;
techniques to advance search-based algorithms&#xd;
&#xd;
in the context of solving quantified boolean &#xd;
&#xd;
formulas (QBF). QBF enables complex realworld&#xd;
&#xd;
problems including planning, two-player games &#xd;
&#xd;
and verification to be captured in a compact &#xd;
&#xd;
and quite natural fashion. We will discuss &#xd;
&#xd;
techniques ranging from straight forward &#xd;
&#xd;
pre-processing methods utilizing strong rules &#xd;
&#xd;
of inference to more sophisticated online &#xd;
&#xd;
approaches such as dynamic partitioning.&#xd;
&#xd;
Furthermore, we will show that all of the &#xd;
&#xd;
presented techniques achieve an essential&#xd;
&#xd;
improvement of the search process when &#xd;
&#xd;
solving QBF. At the same time the displayed&#xd;
&#xd;
empirical results also reveal the &#xd;
&#xd;
orthogonality of the different techniques &#xd;
&#xd;
with respect to performance. Generally &#xd;
&#xd;
speaking each approach performs well on a &#xd;
&#xd;
particular subset of benchmarks, but performs &#xd;
&#xd;
poorly on others. Consequently, an adaptive &#xd;
&#xd;
employment of the available techniques that&#xd;
&#xd;
maximizes the performance would result in &#xd;
&#xd;
further improvements.&#xd;
&#xd;
We will demonstrate that such an adaptive &#xd;
&#xd;
approach can pay off in practice, by&#xd;
&#xd;
presenting the results of using machine &#xd;
&#xd;
learning methods to dynamically select the &#xd;
&#xd;
best variable ordering heuristics during &#xd;
&#xd;
search.</dc:description>

ABSTRACT&#xd;
&#xd;
	Dopamine is the most abundant catecholamine neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain and controls various physiological processes. The D1 dopamine receptor (D1DR) is the predominant dopamine receptor in the brain and traditionally couples to stimulatory G proteins, such as Gs, to activate adenylyl cyclase and generate cAMP.&#xd;
	Although the trafficking itinerary of ER/Golgi maturation, agonist-induced internalization, and recycling/degradation are features common to many G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the molecular regulation of these individual processes for the D1DR is not fully elucidated. Many GPCRs have been shown to form homo-oligomers; the work presented in this thesis explores how multimerization of D1DR has a role in regulating how these receptors are trafficked to the plasma membrane. In addition, the regulation of D1DR internalization is investigated in the context of emerging evidence highlighting the importance of lipid rafts.&#xd;
	Using strategically designed point mutations of the D1DR, specific receptor mutants were found to intracellularly sequester the wild-type receptor by oligomerization. This level of scrutiny by the quality control machinery in the cell could be circumvented by treatment with cell permeable dopaminergic agonists, but not antagonists or inverse agonists. This finding suggests that specific conformational requirements must be achieved before full maturation and anterograde trafficking of the D1DR can proceed. Furthermore, it was determined that cell surface bound D1DRs could internalize through a novel clathrin independent pathway that required binding to the scaffolding protein, caveolin-1. This interaction with caveolin-1 was identified in whole rat brain and was found to require a putative caveolin binding motif in transmembrane domain 7. Palmitoylation of D1DR was found to regulate the rate of agonist-induced caveolae mediated internalization. Finally, we determined that the integrity of caveolae was important in regulating cAMP signaling through D1DR.&#xd;
	These findings provide novel insight into the trafficking requirements of newly synthesized D1DRs as well as alternative mechanisms of regulation of receptors after agonist activation. The oligomerization of GPCRs and the localization of GPCRs in lipid rafts represent two emerging concepts important to many aspects of GPCR function. Future work aimed at integrating these overlapping processes will further our understanding of this important group of cell surface receptors.</dc:description>

<dc:title>The Role of the N-Terminal Zinc Binding Domain of ClpX in Cofactor and Substrate Recognition</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Thibault, Guillaume </dc:creator>
<dc:contributor>Houry, Walid A. </dc:contributor>
<dc:contributor>Biochemistry</dc:contributor>
<dc:description>ClpX is an ATPase that belongs to a unique group of ATP-dependent chaperones supporting targeted protein unfolding and degradation in concert with their respective proteases. ClpX functions alone or in conjunction with a cylindrical serine protease ClpP. ClpX consists of an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal AAA+ ATP-binding domain. The chaperone oligomerizes into a hexamer with the AAA+ domains forming the base of the hexamer and the N-termini extending out of the base. Here we demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of ClpX is a C4-type zinc binding domain (ZBD) which forms a very stable dimer. ZBD is essential for promoting the degradation of some established ClpXP substrates such as lambdaO and MuA. Experiments indicate that ZBD contains a primary binding site for the lambdaO substrate and for the cofactor SspB. Furthermore, analysis of the binding preferences of the ZBD and AAA+ domains revealed that both domains preferentially bind to hydrophobic residues but have different sequence preferences, with the AAA+ domain preferentially recognizing a wider range of specific sequences than ZBD. As part of this analysis, the binding site of SspB on ZBD in ClpX was determined by NMR and mutational analysis. The SspB C-terminus was found to interact with a hydrophobic patch on the surface of ZBD. The affinity of SspB towards ZBD and the geometry of the SspB-ZBD complex were also investigated. Analysis of ClpX conformational changes during its functional cycle indicated that the ZBDs in ClpX undergo a large nucleotide-dependent block movement into the AAA+ ring. Hence, we propose that ClpX switches between a capture and a feeding conformation. Based on all of these results, the ZBD in ClpX clearly plays a major role in substrate binding and cofactor recognition, as well as in substrate translocation into the ClpP chamber.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Columnar jointing is a fracture pattern, best known from locations such as the Giant's Causeway, or Fingal's Cave, in which cracks self-organize into a nearly hexagonal arrangement, leaving behind an ordered colonnade.  In this thesis observations of columnar jointing are reported from both a controlled laboratory setting, and in cooled lava flows.   Experiments were performed in slurries of corn starch and water, which form columnar joints when dried.  This drying process is examined in detail, and it is shown how desiccation leads to the propagation of a sharp shrinkage front.  In general, but with some significant exceptions, the size of columnar joints is inversely dependent on the speed of this shrinkage front during their formation. The exceptions, which include sudden jumps in column scale, show that hysteresis is also important in choosing the column scale.  Novel observations of the 3D structure of joints in starch show that columnar joints do not settle down to a perfect hexagonal pattern, but rather mature into a continuously evolving dynamic pattern. This pattern is scale invariant, and the same statistical distribution of column shapes applies equally to joints in both starch and lava. Field work was performed to study columnar jointing in the basalts of the Columbia River Basalt Group and the island of Staffa, and the more heterogeneous lava flows of Southwestern British Columbia.  The widths of columns and the heights of striae (chisel-like markings that record details of cooling) were examined in detail, and these length scales are shown to be inversely proportional to each other.  An additional length scale, that of wavy columns, is also first reported here.  Based on these measurements, empirical advective-diffusive models are developed to describe the transport of water in a drying starch-cake, and the transport of heat in a cooling lava flow.  These models have only a single scaling parameter, the Péclet number, which relates the fracture front velocity times the column size to the (thermal or hydraulic) diffusivity.  In both cases, the formation of columnar joints occurs at a Péclet number of about 0.2.  This model explains the hundred-fold differences in scale between columnar joints in starches and lavas, and can be used as a tool for the interpretation of joint patterns in the field.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Rationale: Peak initiation of smoking occurs during adolescence and early onset of smoking is associated with a reduced probability of quitting and greater risk of relapse compared to later onset. Considering the epidemiological evidence, adolescents may exhibit a unique biological susceptibility to nicotine taking, in addition to the behavioural and psychosocial factors known to influence adolescent smoking. Objectives: The current series of experiments, using a rat model of adolescent nicotine taking, was designed to investigate age differences in the processes involved in the acquisition and maintenance of nicotine taking that might account for the elevated initiation rates of smoking during adolescence. Methods: We first investigated age differences in the neural response to acute nicotine administration using c-fos mRNA expression. We then examined age differences in the rewarding and aversive effects of nicotine in the conditioned place preference (CPP) and conditioned taste avoidance (CTA) paradigms, respectively. The direct reinforcing effects of nicotine were tested in adolescent and adult rats under a variety of reinforcement schedules in the operant intravenous self-administration paradigm; extinction and nicotine priming-induced reinstatement were also examined. Finally, age differences in nicotine withdrawal precipitated by mecamylamine were assessed. Results: Nicotine had greater activational effects on c-fos mRNA expression in reward-related neural substrates of adolescent compared to adult brain. Adolescent rats were also more sensitive to the rewarding effects of nicotine (CPP) yet less sensitive to its aversive effects (CTA) compared to adult rats. Nicotine was equally reinforcing in adolescents and adults self-administering under simple reinforcement schedules, but adults were more motivated to obtain nicotine under higher reinforcement schedules. Adults were more resistant to extinction, yet both age groups demonstrated similar priming-induced reinstatement of nicotine seeking. Under spontaneous acquisition conditions, adults were more sensitive to the reinforcing effects of a low nicotine infusion dose. The aversive effects of nicotine withdrawal were also more prominent in adults compared to adolescents. Conclusions: These findings have important implications since they demonstrate a unique susceptibility to the conditioned rewarding effects of nicotine that would promote acquisition of smoking behaviour during adolescence, whereas adults may be more vulnerable to processes involved in its maintenance.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The membrane aerated bioreactor (MABR) is a unique technological innovation where a gas permeable membrane is applied to biological processes.  In an MABR, oxygen and other substrates diffuse from the opposite directions into a biofilm, and thus simultaneous chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nitrogen removal can be achieved.  However, controlling biofilm thickness, stability, and attachment is challenging.  The objectives of this research were to study the effect of oxygen partial pressure on process performance with respect to nitrogen removal and examine the biomass properties in MABRs at different oxygen partial pressures and COD loadings.  The conditions within the bioreactors were based on a low hydrodynamic condition (average fluid velocity 22 cm/min along the membrane surface), with the intention of minimizing the impact of the hydrodynamic shear on biomass properties.  Simultaneous nitrification and denitrification were achieved in the reactors, and increasing oxygen partial pressure enhanced the total nitrogen removal.  The biomass at the membrane-biofilm interface was more porous at a loading of 11.3 kg COD/1000 m2/day (areal porosity about 0.9) as compared with a loading of 22.6 kg COD/1000 m2/day (areal porosity about 0.7), indicating carbon substrate was limiting near the membrane.  Long-term (over 30 days) experimental results showed that at the loading of 11.3 kg COD/1000 m2/day, the oxygen partial pressures of 0.59 atm and 0.88 atm caused over 80% of the biomass to become suspended in the bulk phase while at 0.25 atm and 0.41 atm oxygen over 97% of the biomass was immobilized on the membrane.  There is a critical oxygen partial pressure that can sustain the biofilm, which increases with an increasing COD loading.  The nitrifying population in the reactors was examined by applying fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). At the loading of 22.6 kg COD/1000 m2/day, there were 12% beta-proteobacterial ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and 17%Nitrobacter in homogenized biofilm biomass at 0.59 atm oxygen while there were 7% beta-proteobacterial AOB and 4% Nitrobacter at 0.25 atm oxygen.  The ratio of protein to carbohydrate in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of the homogenized biomass in the reactor decreased with increasing oxygen partial pressure.  Surface characterization of the biomass revealed that the higher the oxygen partial pressure, the lower the biomass hydrophobicity and surface charge.  The ratio of EPS protein to carbohydrate in a membrane aerated biofilm decreased when approaching the membrane-biofilm interface.  The distribution of nitrifiers and dissolved oxygen profiles inside the biofilm suggested that dual substrate limitations exist, and it was concluded that the membrane aerated biofilm had an aerobic region in the inner layer and an anoxic region in the outer layer.  It is proposed that the loss of EPS due to secondary substrate consumption, especially the loss of EPS proteins, at the bottom of the biofilm was responsible for biofilm detachment subjected to a critical oxygen partial pressure.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Six experiments were conducted to examine the factors modulating the size of age differences in recollection. The research presented in the current thesis was guided by the notions of self-initiated processing and environmental support. Older and younger adults’ performance in recollection was measured by Jacoby’s (1990) process dissociation procedure (PDP); the age differences as a function of self-initiated processing demands of the task and the amount of support provided to the participants were assessed by manipulating the encoding (Experiments 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3) and retrieval (Experiments 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3) contexts.&#xd;
	Experiments 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 examined interactions of aging and encoding contexts. Recollection under baseline conditions (i.e. visually presented words) was contrasted with recollection of items encoded under contexts that are assumed to enhance memory. The results showed differential age-related patterns of benefits from encoding conditions: Presenting pictures with words benefited older adults more than younger adults; word generation benefited both groups equally; and presenting sound effects with visual words benefited younger more than older adults.&#xd;
	Experiments 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 investigated age-related changes in retrieval processes and their interactions with retrieval contexts. In each of the three experiments, some of the test lists were constructed so that participants had to recollect specific aspects of the encoding event to differentiate between the to-be-included and to-be-excluded items, whereas other test lists were constructed so that they only had to recollect general aspects. Older adults showed reduced levels of recollection than younger adults for the high-specificity test lists only (Experiment 3.1). Encoding manipulations improved (Experiment 3.2) or reduced (Experiment 3.3) recollection performance but the effects did not interact with test, whereas DA at retrieval (Experiment 3.3) in younger adults partly mimicked aging. &#xd;
	In summary, the six experiments showed that older adults have greater difficulties in spontaneously carrying out distinctive and integrative processes at encoding, and in accessing specific information at retrieval compared to their younger counterparts. These age-related changes further interact with the processing demanded or afforded by the encoding and retrieval conditions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Because infants are the most vulnerable members of a community, their deaths – and the resulting infant mortality rate (IMR) – are said to signal more fundamental problems that are likely to affect the general health of a community.  However, a focus on proximate- and intermediate-level risk factors in epidemiological analyses presents a decontextualized picture and ignores the role of larger forces on health, disease, and illness.  In response to this trend, this project will contribute to a revitalization of the use of infant mortality as an index of larger social problems by tempering statistical analyses with critical reflection regarding the effects of the liminal position of Malta within the British imperial system, prior to the Second World War.  In addition, by bringing together several analytic approaches which often proceed in parallel, rather than in dialogue – historical epidemiology, social history, and the analysis of colonial discourse – this dissertation highlights the problematics of knowledge production at both the theoretical and methodological level.  As a result, my work is not just about Malta, one moment in history, the calculation of infant mortality rates, or the disentanglement of various determinants of infant mortality in this context; it is about the dynamics and repercussions of power differentials and of social, economic, and political inequalities, as they define and structure health outcomes and experiences.  Specifically, I will show that fluctuations in international tensions affected Malta’s population on a number of levels because of the island’s importance as a British military and naval base and its location in the middle of the Mediterranean.  I will demonstrate how Malta’s “strategic position” restricted political and economic development in the island and articulated with colonial perceptions of the Maltese as “Other” and Malta as “overpopulated.”  Finally, I will argue that international tensions, Malta’s location within Empire, and perceptions of the island and its inhabitants in the early twentieth century affected the ways in which infant deaths were explained and understood and the strategies of intervention initiated in the island to curtail infant mortality – all of which had a tremendous impact on the rates at which infants in Malta died.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Small quantities of reduced sulphur compounds (RSCs) emitted from Kraft pulp mills can affect air quality due to low odour thresholds.  Chromatographic methods were developed for individual RSCs at ppt to ppb concentrations.  Analyses of ambient air samples showed that while H2S, CH3SH, DMS and DMDS were linked to the pulp mill, the majority of COS and CS2 was due to other sources unrelated to the mill.  The fluxes of individual RSCs from kraft wastewater clarifiers were quantified for the first time. DMDS and DMS were the major RSCs emitted from the primary and secondary clarifiers, respectively.  RSC fluxes were one to three orders of magnitude higher at the primary clarifier than at the secondary one.  Clarifier emissions were, however, insignificant compared to point sources in the mill.  Statistically significant correlations were found between the DMS emission and BOD, COD, as well as TSS in the secondary treatment system.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) derives its tumour selectivity from preferential photosensitizer accumulation and short light penetration in tissue.&#xd;
However, additional strategies are needed to improve the therapeutic index of PDT in oncological applications where light is delivered interstitially to large volumes (e.g. prostate), or when adjacent normal tissue is extremely sensitive (e.g.  brain).&#xd;
Much research to improve PDT's selectivity is directed towards developing targeted photosensitizers. Here, I present two alternative strategies to improve PDT's selectivity, without compromising its efficacy. For interstitial delivery, I investigated whether customizable cylindrical diffusers can be used to deliver light doses that conform better to target geometries, specifically the prostate. Additionally, I examined whether the neuroprotectant erythropoietin, used as an adjuvant to PDT for brain tumours, can reduce the sensitivity of normal tissue, thereby improving treatment selectivity.&#xd;
&#xd;
To determine if tailored diffusers constitute an improvement over conventional ones, I introduce a novel optimization algorithm for treatment planning.&#xd;
I also analyze the sensitivity of the resulting plans to changes in the optical properties and diffuser placement. These results are contextualized by a mathematical formalism to characterize the light dose distributions arising from tailored diffusers. In parallel, I investigate the neuroprotective effects of erythropoietin in PDT of primary cortical neurons in culture and normal rat brain in vivo.&#xd;
&#xd;
I show that the most important parameter determining prostate coverage is the number of diffusers employed. Moreover, while tailored diffusers do offer an improvement over conventional ones, the improvement is likely masked by perturbations introduced by the uncertainties of light delivery. Although these results largely discard the use of tailored diffusers in prostate PDT, significant insight has been gained into PDT treatment planning, and tailored diffusers may still be advantageous in more complicated geometries. Additionally, I show that erythropoietin does not improve survival of PDT-treated neurons PDT, nor reduces the volume of necrosis in vivo, for the ranges of conditions and doses studied. To our knowledge, this is the first time this strategy has been tested in brain PDT and deserves to be investigated further, by using later time-points, functional outcomes, and other neuroprotectants.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>conceptual schemes</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>relativism</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>interpretation</dc:subject>
<dc:description>In his influential essay “On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme”, Donald Davidson argues that we cannot make sense of conceptual relativism, the doctrine that there could be incommensurably different systems of concepts applicable to a single world.  According to Davidson, there is no criterion of identity for language that does not imply or presuppose the possibility that we interpret that language by means of our own language.  Given some plausible assumptions, this implies that there is at most one conceptual scheme, one way of interpreting or representing the world.  But then the very idea of a conceptual scheme is empty.&#xd;
&#xd;
The dissertation is an examination of Davidson’s reasoning, and a defence of a different position regarding conceptual relativism.  I reject much of Davidson’s argumentation, and his radical (subordinate) conclusion that we would be able, at least in principle, to make sense of any language.  Languages that we would be unable to translate or interpret, even in principle, are at least logically possible, in my view.  However, this possibility should not be thought to imply or encourage conceptual relativism.  In this respect, I think that Davidson and many of his critics have conflated the notion of a difference in conceptual scheme, which requires incommensurability between languages or systems of concepts, and mere conceptual difference.&#xd;
&#xd;
I argue that a genuinely alternative conceptual scheme would be associated with language unintelligible to us because of its relation to our language.  For what is at issue, supposedly, is a conceptual relation:  a relation between languages, not a relation between speakers, or their capacities, on the one hand, and languages, on the other.  I try to show how some of Davidson’s arguments, suitably modified, can be deployed against the possibility of an alternative scheme, so understood, and provide some additional arguments of my own.  My position is thus significantly weaker than Davidson’s:  there could not be languages that we would be unable to interpret because they are incommensurable with our own.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Markets have an important role to play in advancing an improved understanding of international trading relationships. Two most important economic issues, which contribute to improved national welfare and ensure long-run competitive market equilibrium in international markets, are market integration and market efficiency. To provide softwood lumber markets related information to the policy makers, economic analyses relating market integration and market efficiency of the combined markets of Canada and the US have been conducted. The economic analyses include: (i) testing cointegration of prices among North American softwood lumber markets; (ii) identifying price leading markets in long-run price structure of these cointegrated markets; (iii) examining the degree of market integration among these markets; and (iv) testing the efficiency of spatial arbitrage among these markets.&#xd;
&#xd;
First, the price linkages in the North American softwood lumber markets have been explored over different trade regimes. The results indicate that market integration is affected by product aggregation of data. Further investigations of market integration are, therefore, limited to homogeneous softwood lumber product markets. Second, oligopsonistic pricing behavior of traders is identified as the possible reason for imperfect competition among Douglas Fir product markets, while imperfect competition among the markets of Spruce-Pine-Fir and Hem Fir products can not be explained by this behavior. Third, a comprehensive picture of the adherence to price parity is formulated by evaluating the magnitude and persistence of deviations from equilibrium relation of prices. It is found that large volumes of trade, product substitutability, lower prices, and certainty of trade are the factors which contribute to higher degree of market integration among North American softwood lumber product markets. Finally, the inter-temporal shifts in regime probabilities of competitive market equilibrium are assessed over different trade regimes. It is found that lower transaction costs, large volumes of trade, short distances between markets, and certainty of trade contribute to high market efficiency among softwood lumber product markets of North America.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This dissertation examines the level of social and cultural interaction between the Greek and Turkish communities of İzmir and the impact of the centralizing Ottoman reforms on the society of İzmir during the age of the Ottoman modernization. It focuses on the years between 1826 and 1864 that marked a turning point in the administrative history of the Ottoman Empire. Analyzing this subject requires understanding the social-cultural and economic dynamics of İzmir that played a crucial role in the formation of the social fabric of the city. Ottoman-Turkish archival material and to some extent Greek newspapers of the time are used as primary sources. The sources discussed in this dissertation demonstrate that the central authority attempted to re-integrate İzmir into its administrative and political structure in accordance with the centralizing or repressive Tanzimat reforms. However, Tanzimat reforms did not disturb the social cohesion of İzmir, which the city produced over the centuries with its local character and some peculiar dynamics. The evidence also indicates that the Empire did not aim to mold social relations in İzmir, instead benefited from city’s already existing social-cultural and economic situation, which was well suited to its modernization program. This study attempts to write a social and cultural history of İzmir, by considering the ethno-religious policies of the Ottoman state in the given period and questioning Ottoman modernity through the prism of the Greek-Turkish communal relations. Much of the conventional Turkish and Greek historiography of the post WWI years has analyzed 19th century İzmir's history in terms of two “conflicting nations.” While Turkish historiography has focused on the ethnic homogeneity of Turks and its history, modern Greek historiography has stressed the suppression of the Ottoman Greeks under the Ottoman rule. Such approaches have engendered the commonly used categories of Greek versus Turkish or Muslim versus non-Muslim. Approaching İzmir as an organic whole, instead of dividing the city according to ethno-religious criterion, this dissertation tries to uncover the dynamics of coexistence and communal relations, which marked the life of the city for centuries, but was brought to an abrupt end as a result of the modern nation state formations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study explores the ways in which young people in the neighbourhood of Old Town in Bamenda negotiate the predicament of blocked opportunities and ‘arrested adulthood’ occasioned by the decline in the nation-building project and prolonged socio-economic and moral crisis in Cameroon. I investigate how urban youth in Old Town construct their moral and socio-cultural worlds through involvement in associations. The main finding suggests that faced with growing uncertainty, young people in Bamenda are positioning themselves as important social actors by drawing on local cultural resources such as associations to construct their social worlds that aim to circumvent their exclusion and marginality. In this light, I analyse youth associations as central although not exclusive to negotiating young people’s predicament by focusing on a range of practices through which they seek respectability and claim social adult status.&#xd;
&#xd;
Drawing on the concepts of transition, subjectivities and personhood, I show that young people straddle the worlds of ‘youth’ and social adulthood, statuses that are not only cultural constructions but also the products of differential power relations and social positioning. I contend that the processes of positioning and the production of personhood are largely experienced through involvement in associational life. The study focuses on three associations, namely the Chosen Sisters, the United Sisters and the Ntambag Brothers Association (NBA). Organised on the basis of seniority and gender, I argue that these associations, while negotiating claims to adult status for their members, tend to challenge state-centric notions of citizenship as they simultaneously position themselves as moral actors upon whom society can count on for regeneration. Through a range of social projects, pursued on behalf of and sanctioned by the community, young people in Old Town reaffirm the centrality of interdependence and the situated understanding of social adulthood predicated on the redistribution of one’s success or achievement. This study points to the re-emergent role of associations in negotiating everyday life in the face of crisis. It is a significant contribution towards understanding voluntary and communal associations in general and young people’s modes of transitions into social adulthood.</dc:description>

<dc:description>BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction is a principal player in the development of allograft vasculopathy and allograft failure. The hallmark of endothelial dysfunction is impaired nitric oxide bioavailability. Recent evidence implicates endothelin-1 as an integral component of endothelial dysfunction. Immunosuppressive drugs have also been associated with the development of graft vasculopathy. We speculated that endothelin-1 results in endothelial dysfunction by impairing nitric oxide homeostasis and is a player in hypoxia and reperfusion induced vasomotor injury. In addition, we hypothesized that endothelin-1 antagonism with bosentan will limit hypoxia and reperfusion injury and prevent immunosuppressive drug injury. METHODS: We utilized human saphenous vein endothelial cells to evaluate the effects of endothelin-1, hypoxia and reperfusion on endothelial function, protein kinase modulation and cell survival. We also employed a rodent model of chronic drug therapy to assess the effect of cyclosporine and rapamycin treatment on vasomotor function. We investigated the role of nitric oxide augmentation and bosentan in preventing hypoxia and reperfusion injury and in limiting immunosuppressive drug induced vasomotor dysfunction. RESULTS: Elevated endothelin-1 levels resulted in impaired nitric oxide release and endothelial function. The effects of endothelin-1 as well as hypoxia and reperfusion were mediated by altered protein kinase B and protein kinase C activity resulting in endothelial dysfunction. We revealed that endothelin-1 is a key player in hypoxia and reperfusion induced endothelial injury. The immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine induced vasomotor dysfunction while rapamycin preserved vessel homeostasis. Vasomotor dysfunction was characterized by impaired nitric oxide and endothelin-1 homeostasis. Bosentan limited the deleterious effects of endothelin-1, hypoxic injury, reperfusion injury and cyclosporine induced vasomotor impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that endothelin-1 exposure as well as hypoxia and reperfusion results in endothelial dysfunction by altering specific protein kinase C isoform activities and inhibiting protein kinase B. Cyclosporine induced vasomotor dysfunction was mediated by altered nitric oxide and endothelin-1 homeostasis while rapamycin was endothelial protective. Bosentan proved to be an effective therapy at preventing endothelin-1, hypoxia and reperfusion and cyclosporine induced endothelial dysfunction. Protein kinase C modulation as well as bosentan may prove to be NOVEL therapies to prevent endothelial injury during cardiac transplantation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Medical decisions should be based on good evidence. But this does not mean that health care professionals should practice evidence-based medicine. This dissertation explores how these two positions come apart, why they come apart, and what we should do about it. I begin by answering the descriptive question, what are current standards of evidence in medicine? I then provide a detailed critique of these standards. Finally, I address the more difficult normative question, how should we determine standards of evidence in medicine?&#xd;
&#xd;
In medicine, standards of evidence have been established by the pervasive evidence-based medicine (EBM) movement. Until now, these standards have not been subjected to comprehensive philosophical scrutiny. I outline and defend a theory of knowledge – a version of Helen Longino’s Critical Contextual Empiricism (CCE) – which enables me to critically evaluate EBM. My version of CCE emphasizes the critical evaluation of background assumptions. In accordance with this, I identify and critically evaluate the three substantive assumptions underlying EBM. First, I argue that medicine should not be held to the restrictive definition of science assumed by proponents of EBM. Second, I argue that epidemiological evidence should not be the only “base” of medical decisions. Third, I argue that not only is the particular hierarchy of evidence assumed by EBM unjustified, but that any attempt to hierarchically rank research methods is incoherent and unjustifiably restricts medical knowledge. Current standards of evidence divert attention from many legitimate sources of evidence. This distorts medical research and practice.&#xd;
&#xd;
In the remainder of the dissertation I propose means for improving not only current standards of medical evidence but also the process of producing and defending future standards. On the basis of four CCE norms, I argue that we have reason to protect and promote those features of the medical community that facilitate diversity, transparency, and critical interaction. Only then can we ensure that the medical community retains its ability to produce evidence that is both rigorous and relevant to practice.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A longitudinal pilot study to compare, in children with reduced overbite malocclusions associated with oral habits (finger-sucking and tongue-thrusting), the effects of the experimental Myofunctional Trainer (MFT; Myofunctional Research Co.) and the conventional Bluegrass appliance (BG) on dento-alveolar relations, tongue position, and on speech. Methods: The experimental group received the MFT appliance while the control group received the BG appliance. Dento-alveolar changes were assessed by cephalometry and study models. Longitudinal midsagittal 2-dimensional B-mode ultrasound scans of the tongue surface were performed to determine tongue position. Speech acceptability tests were also performed. Results &amp; Conclusions: The BG appliance was successful in breaking the finger-sucking habit. The MFT appliance showed only partial success which could be attributed to lack of compliance. At the end of treatment, the open bite was reduced in both groups due to dento-alveolar changes. The BG appliance had a deleterious effect on speech acceptability while in place, while there was no such effect with the MFT appliance.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In 2007, Uganda had one of the lowest levels of access to electricity in the world. Given the influence of multilateral and bilateral agencies in Uganda; the strong international reputation and domestic influence of its President; the country’s historic achievements in public sector and economic reform; and the intimate connection between economic performance, social well-being and access to electricity, the problems with Uganda’s electricity sector have proven deeply frustrating and, indeed, puzzling.  Following increased scholarly attention to the relationship between political change, policymaking, and public sector reform in sub-Saharan Africa and the developing world generally, this thesis examines the multilevel politics of Uganda’s electricity sector reform process.  This study contends that explanations for Uganda’s electricity sector reform problems generally, and hydroelectric dam construction efforts specifically, must move beyond technical and financial factors.  Problems in this sector have also been the result of a model of reform (promoted by the World Bank) that failed adequately to account for the character of political change.   Indeed, the model of reform that was promoted and implemented was risky and it was deeply antagonistic to domestic and international civil society organizations. In addition, it was presented as a linear, technical, apolitical exercise. Finally the model was inconsistent with key principles the Bank itself, and public policy literature generally, suggest are needed for success. Based on this analysis, the thesis contends that policymaking and reform must be understood as deeply political processes, which not only define access to services, but also participation in, and exclusion from, national debates. Future approaches to reform and policymaking must anticipate the complex, multilevel, non-linear character of ‘second-generation’ policy issues like electricity, and the political and institutional capacity needed to increase the potential for success.  At the heart of this approach is a need to carefully consider how the character of state-society relations in the country – “governance” – will influence reform processes and outcomes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This thesis strives to enhance the performance of delta-sigma modulators in two areas: increasing their speed and enabling their operation in a low voltage environment. &#xd;
Parallelism based on time-interleaving can be used to increase the speed of delta-sigma modulators. A novel single-path time-interleaved architecture is derived and analyzed. Finite opamp gain and bandwidth result in a mismatch between the noise transfer functions of the internal quantizers which degrades the performance of the new modulator. Two techniques are presented to mitigate the mismatch problem: a hybrid topology where the first stage uses multiple integrators while the rest of the modulator uses a single path of integrators and a digital calibration method.&#xd;
The input-feedforward technique removes the input-signal component from the internal nodes of delta-sigma modulators. The removal of the signal component reduces the signal swing and distortion requirements for the opamps. These characteristics enable the reliable implementation of delta-sigma modulators in modern CMOS technology. Two implementation issues for modulators with input-feedforward are considered. First, the drawback of the analog adder at the quantizer input is identified and the capacitive input feedforward technique is introduced to eliminate the adder. Second, the double sampled input technique is proposed to remove the critical path generate by the input feedforward path. &#xd;
Novel input-feedforward delta-sigma architecture is proposed. The new digital input feedforward (DIFF) modulator maintains the low swing and low distortion requirements of the input feedforward technique, it eliminates the analog adder at the quantizer input, and it improves the achievable resolution. To demonstrate these advantages, a configurable delta-sigma modulator which can operate as a feedback topology or in DIFF mode is implemented in 0.18μm CMOS technology. Both modulators operate at 20MHz clock with an oversampling ratio of 8. The power consumption in the DIFF mode is 22mW and in feedback mode is 19mW. However, the DIFF mode achieves a peak SNDR of 73.7dB (77.1dB peak SNR) while the feedback mode achieves a peak SNDR of 64.3dB (65.9dB peak SNR). Therefore, the energy required per conversion step for the DIFF architecture (2.2 pJ/step) is less than half of that required by the feedback architecture (5.7 pJ/step).</dc:description>

<dc:description>Through the development of physical chemistry and chemical physics over the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, the relationship between physics and chemistry changed to create a broad interdisciplinary framework in which chemists and physicists could make contributions to problems of common value. It is here argued that evolving disciplinary factors such as physical and chemical responses to the atomic hypothesis, the nature of disciplinary formation in Germany and the United States, the reception of quantum mechanics within physics and chemistry, and the application of quantum mechanics to the problem of chemical bonding by physicists and chemists, formed the chemical bond into a physico-chemical theory.&#xd;
In the late nineteenth-century context of early physical chemistry, the chemical bond was known as a physical link between atoms, which could not be studied by chemical means because of the lack of an adequate atomistic framework. Both chemists and physicists broadly accepted the atomistic hypothesis following the discovery of the electron at the turn of the twentieth century, which afforded theoretical study of chemical&#xd;
bonding. Between 1916 and 1919, Gilbert N. Lewis and Irving Langmuir proposed the&#xd;
valence bond to be a pair of electrons shared between two atoms, within the context of a&#xd;
cubic model of the atom. However, the lack of a physical mechanism for the shared&#xd;
electron pair prevented the formation of a fully physico-chemical view of bonding. In&#xd;
1927, physicists Walter Heitler and Fritz London showed the stability of the valence bond was caused by the wave mechanical phenomenon of resonance. Chemist Linus Pauling extended their treatment of the valence bond to a theory of structural chemistry in The Nature of the Chemical Bond. His synthesis of the physical and chemical views, his value as a physico-chemical researcher during the 1930s, and the research of his contemporaries John Slater and Robert Mulliken show that a true physico-chemical blend was only realized within the amorphous discipline of chemical physics. Finally, it is seen that this interdisciplinarity of chemical bonding and its supporting framework force a reevaluation of the reductionist criteria, and a re-definition of the chemical bond as a physico-chemical work.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Current access strategies for minimal interface (e.g., binary switch) users employ time-coded (i.e., synchronous) protocols that map unique sequences of user-generated binary digits (i.e., bits) to each of the available outcomes of a device under control.&#xd;
With such strategies, the user must learn and/or reproduce the timing of the protocol with a certain degree of accuracy. As a result, the number, κ, of device outcomes made accessible to the user is typically bound by the memorization capacity of the latter and by the time required to generate the appropriate bit sequences. Furthermore, synchronous access strategies introduce a minimum time delay that increases with larger κ, precluding access to control applications requiring fast user response.&#xd;
&#xd;
By turning control on its head, this thesis presents an access method that completely eliminates reliance on time-coded protocols. Instead, the proposed asynchronous access method requires users to employ their interfaces only when the behavior of the device under control does not match their intentions. In response to such event, the proposed method may then be used to select, and automatically transmit, a new outcome to the device. Such outcome is informed by historical and contextual assumptions incorporated into a recursive algorithm that provides increasingly accurate estimates of user intention.&#xd;
&#xd;
This novel approach, provides signiﬁcant advantages over traditional synchronous strategies: i) the user is not required to learn any protocol, ii) there is no limit in the number of outcomes that may be made available to the user iii) there is no delay in the response of the device, iv) the expected amount of information required to achieve a particular task may be minimized, and, most importantly, v) the control of previously inaccessible devices may be enabled with minimal interfaces.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis presents the full mathematical development of the novel method for asynchronous control summarized above. Rigorous performance evaluations demonstrating the potential of this method in the control of complex devices, by means of minimal interfaces, are also reported.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>DNA damage response</dc:subject>
<dc:description>In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, RTT107 (ESC4, YHR154W) encodes a BRCT-domain protein that is important for recovery from DNA damage during S phase.  I have found that Rtt107 forms a complex with the Slx1/Slx4 structure-specific nuclease.  Deletion of SLX4 confers many of the same phenotypes observed in rtt107∆, including DNA damage sensitivity, prolonged DNA damage checkpoint activation, and increased spontaneous DNA damage, suggesting that Slx4 and Rtt107 function in concert.  These defects are not shared by Slx1 indicating that the function of Slx4 and Slx1 in the DNA damage response is not entirely overlapping.  Furthermore, I found that Slx4 regulates the phosphorylation of Rtt107 by the checkpoint kinase Mec1.  &#xd;
The phenotypes conferred by deletion of RTT107 and the spectrum of its synthetic genetic interactions indicates that Rtt107 may function at stalled replication forks.  I have shown that Rtt107 is recruited to chromatin in the presence of DNA damaging agents that cause DNA replication forks to stall.  Recruitment of Rtt107 to chromatin requires Rtt109, an acetyltransferase, and the cullin Rtt101, but is not dependent on Slx4 or the checkpoint kinases.  Rtt109 acetylates histone H3 on lysine 56 (H3-K56), yet recruitment of Rtt107 to chromatin does not require acetylation of H3-K56, indicating that Rtt109 may have additional targets.  Chromatin immunoprecipitation indicates that the sites of Rtt107 binding correspond to regions at or near stalled replication forks throughout the genome.  I propose that Rtt107 acts in the recovery from DNA damage by localizing to stalled replication forks and acting as a scaffold for assembly of DNA damage response proteins, ultimately promoting replication fork restart.</dc:description>

<dc:description>As the field programmable gate array (FPGA) industry grows device&#xd;
capacity with Moore's law and expands its market to high performance&#xd;
computing, scalability of its key CAD algorithms emerges as a new&#xd;
priority to deliver a user experience competitive to parallel&#xd;
processors. Among the many walls to overcome, placement stands out due&#xd;
to its critical impact on both frontend synthesis and backend routing.&#xd;
&#xd;
To construct a scalable placement flow, we present three innovations&#xd;
in detailed placement: a legalizer that works well under low&#xd;
whitespace; a wirelength optimizer based on bipartite matching; and a&#xd;
cache-aware annealer. When applied to the hundred-thousand cell IBM benchmark&#xd;
suite, our detailed placer can achieve 27% better wirelength and&#xd;
8X faster runtime against FastDP, the fastest academic&#xd;
detailed placer reported, and our full placement flow can achieve 101X faster runtime, with 5% wirelength overhead, against VPR,&#xd;
the de facto standard in FPGA placements.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Cellular Mechanisms of the  Systemic Inflammatory Response Following Resuscitated Hemorrhagic Shock: The Role of Reactive Oxygen Species and Toll-like Receptor 4</dc:title>

<dc:subject>TLR4 Macrophage Trauma Shock Resuscitation Lipopolysaccharide ARDS MODS SIRS</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) following hemorrhagic&#xd;
shock/resuscitation (S/R) is an important contributor to late morbidity and mortality in trauma&#xd;
patients. S/R promotes ARDS by inducing oxidative stress that primes cells of the innate&#xd;
immune system for excessive responsiveness to small inflammatory stimuli, termed the “twohit”&#xd;
hypothesis. Activated alveolar macrophages (AM) play a central role and when recovered&#xd;
from S/R animals exhibit an exaggerated responsiveness to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with&#xd;
increased activation of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-κB, and augmented&#xd;
expression of cytokines. LPS triggers AM signalling through Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4), which&#xd;
resides in plasma membrane lipid rafts.&#xd;
The objective of this work is to define cellular mechanisms of macrophage priming by&#xd;
oxidative stress following shock resuscitation. The main hypothesis investigated is that altered&#xd;
cellular distribution of TLR4 can lead to macrophage priming and antioxidant resuscitation&#xd;
strategies can diminish these effects.&#xd;
AM of rodents, exposed in vivo to oxidant stress following S/R, increase their surface&#xd;
levels of TLR4, which in turn results in augmented NF-κB translocation in response to small&#xd;
doses of LPS. Furthermore, in vitro H2O2 treatment of RAW 264.7 macrophages results in&#xd;
similar TLR4 surface translocation. Depletion of intracellular calcium, disruption of the&#xd;
cytoskeleton or inhibition of the Src kinases prevents the H2O2-induced TLR4 translocation,&#xd;
suggesting the involvement of receptor exocytosis. Further, fluorescent resonance energy&#xd;
iii&#xd;
transfer between TLR4 and lipid rafts as well as biochemical raft analysis demonstrated that&#xd;
oxidative stress redistributes TLR4 to surface lipid rafts. Preventing the oxidant-induced&#xd;
movement of TLR4 to lipid rafts using methyl-ß-cyclodextrin precluded the increased&#xd;
responsiveness of cells to LPS after H2O2 treatment. Further, AM priming by oxidative stress&#xd;
can be diminished by early exposure to resuscitation regimens with direct or indirect systemic&#xd;
antioxidant effects, such as 25% albumin, N-acetylcysteine and hypertonic saline.&#xd;
Hyperosmolarity was found to modulate AM TLR4 gene and protein expression.&#xd;
Collectively, these studies suggest a novel mechanism whereby oxidative stress might&#xd;
prime the responsiveness of cells of the innate immune system. Targeting the TLR4 signalling&#xd;
pathway early during shock resuscitation may represent an anti-inflammatory strategy able to&#xd;
ameliorate late morbidity and mortality following S/R.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Development of an automated method for classifying digital images using a combination of image quality modification and Bayesian classification is the subject of this thesis.  The specific example is classification of images obtained by monitoring molten plastic in an extruder.  These images were to be classified into two groups:  the “with particle” (WP) group which showed contaminant particles and the “without particle” (WO) group which did not.  Previous work effected the classification using only an adaptive Bayesian model.  This work combines adaptive image quality modification with the adaptive Bayesian model.  The first objective was to develop an off-line automated method for determining how to modify each individual raw image to obtain the quality required for improved classification results.  This was done in a very novel way by defining image quality in terms of probability using a Bayesian classification model. The Nelder Mead Simplex method was then used to optimize the quality.  The result was a “Reference Image Database” which was used as a basis for accomplishing the second objective.  The second objective was to develop an in-line method for modifying the quality of new images to improve classification over that which could be obtained previously.  Case Based Reasoning used the Reference Image Database to locate reference images similar to each new image.  The database supplied instructions on how to modify the new image to obtain a better quality image.  Experimental verification of the method used a variety of images from the extruder monitor including images purposefully produced to be of wide diversity.  Image quality modification was made adaptive by adding new images to the Reference Image Database.  When combined with adaptive classification previously employed, error rates decreased from about 10% to less than 1% for most images.  For one unusually difficult set of images that exhibited very low local contrast of particles in the image against their background it was necessary to split the Reference Image Database into two parts on the basis of a critical value for local contrast.  The end result of this work is a very powerful, flexible and general method for improving classification of digital images that utilizes both image quality modification and classification modeling.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Severe manifestations of malaria, including cerebral malaria (CM) and respiratory distress, result in approximately three million deaths annually worldwide. Currently, relatively little is known about severe disease pathogenesis. The development and outcome of severe malaria is determined by host-pathogen interactions, a complex interface of genetics and immune responses. Hypothetically, a spectrum of genetic susceptibility and resistance to severe disease exists within the host population, and malaria infection results in diverse host and parasite responses that impact disease outcome. The aim of this study was to identify differential host and parasite responses in a murine model of severe malaria, Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA), in CM-susceptible and CM-resistant mice; and to analyze host genetics in patients with severe disease due to Plasmodium falciparum. &#xd;
&#xd;
In vivo, expression microarray analysis showed that, in malaria target organs, differential responses were related to immune response – primarily interferon and complement pathways – and apoptosis. Histopathological examination of the brain confirmed an increased prevalence of apoptosis in CM-susceptible mice. Further examination of the role of complement in CM-susceptibility determined that early complement 5 (C5) activation conferred susceptibility to CM, and that C5 deficiency conferred resistance, which could be recapitulated by antibody blockade of activated C5 or its receptor in susceptible mice. Additionally, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) studies identified that complement receptor 1 SNPs were associated with disease severity in patients with P. falciparum malaria. PbA parasites displayed a unique transcriptional signature in each tissue examined (brain, liver, spleen and lung), showed differential gene expression between CM-resistant and susceptible hosts, and were most prominent in lung tissue. Closer examination of lung involvement in PbA infection revealed that PbA-infected C57BL/6 mice develop acute lung injury (ALI), defined by disruption of the alveolar-capillary membrane barrier. ALI susceptibility did not correlate with CM susceptibility, but was influenced by peripheral parasite burden and CD36-mediated parasite sequestration in the lung. &#xd;
&#xd;
PbA provides a clinically relevant experimental model for CM and ALI, through which important disease mechanisms can be identified and modulated. Ideally, the use of such models aids in the discovery of disease biomarkers and novel therapeutic strategies, which may be applied to human severe and cerebral malaria.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>Mortality modelling</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>Time-changed Markov process</dc:subject>
<dc:description>For life insurance and annuity products whose payoffs depend on the future mortality rates, there is a risk that realized&#xd;
mortality rates will be different from the anticipated rates&#xd;
accounted for in their pricing and reserving calculations. This is&#xd;
termed as mortality risk. Since mortality risk is difficult to&#xd;
diversify and  has significant financial impacts on insurance&#xd;
policies and pension plans, it is now a well-accepted fact that&#xd;
stochastic approaches shall be adopted to model the mortality risk&#xd;
and to evaluate the mortality-linked securities.&#xd;
&#xd;
The objective of this thesis is to propose the use of a&#xd;
time-changed Markov process to describe stochastic mortality&#xd;
dynamics for pricing and risk management purposes.  Analytical and&#xd;
empirical properties of this dynamics have been investigated using&#xd;
a matrix-analytic methodology.  Applications of the proposed model&#xd;
in the evaluation of fair values for mortality linked securities&#xd;
have also been explored.&#xd;
&#xd;
To be more specific, we consider a finite-state Markov process&#xd;
with one absorbing state. This Markov process is related to an&#xd;
underlying aging mechanism and the survival time is viewed as the&#xd;
time until absorption. The resulting distribution for the survival&#xd;
time is a so-called phase-type distribution. This approach is&#xd;
different from the traditional curve fitting mortality models in&#xd;
the sense that the survival probabilities are now linked with an&#xd;
underlying Markov aging process. Markov mathematical and&#xd;
phase-type distribution theories therefore provide us a flexible&#xd;
and tractable framework to model the mortality dynamics. And the&#xd;
time-changed Markov process allows us to incorporate the&#xd;
uncertainties embedded in the future mortality evolution.&#xd;
&#xd;
The proposed model has been applied to price the EIB/BNP Longevity&#xd;
Bonds and other mortality derivatives under the independent&#xd;
assumption of interest rate and mortality rate. A calibrating&#xd;
method for the model is suggested so that it can utilize both the&#xd;
market price information involving the relevant mortality risk and&#xd;
the latest mortality projection. The proposed model has also been&#xd;
fitted to various type of population mortality data for empirical&#xd;
study. The fitting results show that our model can interpret the&#xd;
stylized mortality patterns very well.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Real world data is not random: The variability in the data-sets that arise in computer vision,&#xd;
signal processing and other areas is often highly constrained and governed by a number of&#xd;
degrees of freedom that is much smaller than the superficial dimensionality of the data.&#xd;
Unsupervised learning methods can be used to automatically discover the “true”, underlying&#xd;
structure in such data-sets and are therefore a central component in many systems that deal&#xd;
with high-dimensional data.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis we develop several new approaches to modeling the low-dimensional structure&#xd;
in data. We introduce a new non-parametric framework for latent variable modelling, that in&#xd;
contrast to previous methods generalizes learned embeddings beyond the training data and its&#xd;
latent representatives. We show that the computational complexity for learning and applying&#xd;
the model is much smaller than that of existing methods, and we illustrate its applicability&#xd;
on several problems.&#xd;
&#xd;
We also show how we can introduce supervision signals into latent variable models using&#xd;
conditioning. Supervision signals make it possible to attach “meaning” to the axes of a latent&#xd;
representation and to untangle the factors that contribute to the variability in the data. We&#xd;
develop a model that uses conditional latent variables to extract rich distributed representations&#xd;
of image transformations, and we describe a new model for learning transformation&#xd;
features in structured supervised learning problems.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Knowledge Provenance: An Approach to Modeling and Maintaining The Evolution and Validity of Knowledge</dc:title>

<dc:subject>Knowledge Provenance</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>Trust Formalization</dc:subject>
<dc:description>The Web has become an open decentralized global information / knowledge repository, a platform for distributed computing and global electronic markets, where people are confronted with information of unknown sources, and need to interact with “strangers”. This makes trust and the validity of information in cyberspace arise as crucial issues.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis proposes knowledge provenance (KP) as a formal approach to determining the origin and validity of information / knowledge on the Web, by means of modeling and maintaining the information sources, information dependencies, and trust structures. We conceptualize and axiomatize KP ontology including static KP and dynamic KP. The proposed KP ontology, provides a formal representation of linking trust in information creators and belief in the information created; lays a foundation for further study of knowledge provenance; provides logical systems for provenance reasoning by machines. The web ontology of KP can be used to annotate web information; and KP reasoner can be used as a tool to trace the origin and to determine the validity of Web information. &#xd;
&#xd;
Since knowledge provenance is based on trust in information sources, this thesis also proposes a logical theory of trust in epistemic logic and situation calculus. In particular, we formally define the semantics of trust; from it, we identify two types of trust: trust in belief and trust in performance; reveal and prove that trust in belief is transitive; trust in performance is not, but by trust in belief, trust in performance can propagate in social networks; by using situation calculus in trust formalization, the context of trust is formally represented by reified fluents; we also propose a distributed logical model for trust reasoning using social networks, by which each agent’s private data about trust relationships can be protected. This study provides a formal theoretical analysis on the transitivity of trust, which supports trust propagation in social networks. This study of trust supports not only knowledge provenance but also the general trust modeling in cyberspace.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>electrocardiogram</dc:subject>
<dc:description>This thesis studies the applicability of the electrocardiogram signal (ECG) as a biometric. There is strong evidence that heart's electrical activity embeds highly distinctive characteristics, suitable for applications such as the recognition of human subjects. Such systems traditionally provide two modes of functionality, identification and authentication; frameworks for subject recognition are herein proposed and analyzed in both scenarios. &#xd;
&#xd;
As in most pattern recognition problems, the probability of mis-classification error decreases as more learning information becomes available. Thus, a central consideration is the design and evaluation of algorithms which exploit the added information provided by the 12 lead standard ECG recording system. Feature and decision level fusion techniques described in thesis, offer enhanced security levels. &#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
The main novelty of the proposed approach, lies in the  design  of an identification system robust to cardiac arrhythmias.  Criteria concerning the power distribution and information theoretic complexity of electrocardiogram windows are defined to signify abnormal ECG recordings,  not suitable for recognition. Experimental results indicate high recognition rates and highlight identification based on ECG signals as very promising.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>Auctions</dc:subject>
<dc:description>With the emergence of the Internet as a global structure for communication and interaction,&#xd;
many “business to consumer” and “business to business” applications have migrated online,&#xd;
thus increasing the need for software agents that can act on behalf of people, institutions or&#xd;
companies with private and often conflicting interests. The design of such agents, and the&#xd;
protocols (i.e., mechanisms) through which they interact, has therefore naturally become an &#xd;
important research theme. &#xd;
&#xd;
Classical mechanism design techniques from the economics literature do not account for the costs &#xd;
entailed with the full revelation of preferences that they require. The aim of this thesis is to &#xd;
investigate how to design mechanisms that only require the revelation &#xd;
of partial preference information and are applicable in any mechanism design context. We call this &#xd;
partial revelation mechanism design. Reducing revelation&#xd;
costs is thus our main concern. With only partial revelation, the designer has some remaining&#xd;
uncertainty over the agents’ types, even after the mechanism has been executed. Thus, in&#xd;
general, the outcome chosen will not be optimal with respect to the designer’s objective function.&#xd;
This alone raises interesting questions about which (part of the) information should be&#xd;
elicited in order to minimize the degree of sub-optimality incurred by the mechanism. But this&#xd;
sub-optimality of the mechanism’s outcome choice function has additional important consequences:&#xd;
most of the results in classical mechanism design which guarantee that agents will&#xd;
reveal their type truthfully to the mechanism rely on the fact that the optimal outcome is chosen.&#xd;
We must therefore also investigate if, and how, appropriate incentives can be maintained&#xd;
in partial revelation mechanisms.&#xd;
&#xd;
We start by presenting our own model for partial revelation mechanism design. Our second&#xd;
contribution is a negative one regarding the quasi-impossibility of&#xd;
implementing partial revelation mechanisms with exact incentive properties. The rest of the&#xd;
thesis shows, in different settings, how this negative result can be bypassed in various settings, &#xd;
depending on the designer's objective (e.g., social welfare, revenue...) and the interaction type &#xd;
(sequential or one shot). Finally, we study how the approximation of the&#xd;
incentive properties can be further improved when necessary, and in the process, introduce&#xd;
and proves the existence of a new equilibrium concept.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Lymph node metastasis is a critical prognostic factor for lung cancer.  Effective therapy to control lymphatic metastasis may improve survival.  The work described in this thesis focuses on the development of a microparticulate lymphatic targeting system, which can be applied as an adjuvant therapy in the control of lymphatic metastasis in lung cancer.  &#xd;
The study shows that intrapleural administered colloidal particulates are predominantly taken up by regional lymphatic tissue in rat models including healthy rats, rats bearing orthotopic lung tumours and rats following pneumonectomy.  The effect of particle size on lymphatic particle distribution was examined by intrapleural administration of 111In-aminopolystyrene beads.  Approximately 2 µm is a suitable size for intrapleural lymphatic targeting.  Biodegradable polylactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) microparticles containing the anticancer agent paclitaxel (PTX) were subsequently formulated in the desired size by spray drying.  PLGA-PTX microspheres were incorporated into a biodegradable and biocompatible gelatin sponge matrix to form an implantable lymphatic targeted drug delivery system.  The system was characterized in vitro and its lymphatic targeting ability was examined in vivo.  Fluorescence labeled microspheres embedded within the sponge were selectively taken up by regional lymphatics as the sponge matrix disintegrated following intrapleural implantation.  A pharmacokinetic study showed that the total PTX exposure in lymphatic tissue was dramatically higher than that achieved through intravenous administration.  The peak plasma drug concentration, which governs systemic toxicity, was significantly reduced.  The low but persistent detection of plasma PTX indicates that PTX was control released from the system after intrapleural implantation.  In a therapeutic efficacy study performed in the H460 orthotopic lung cancer model, gelatin sponges containing PLGA-PTX microspheres were placed in the pleural cavity as an adjuvant treatment after surgical resection of the primary lung tumour.  Trans-lymphatic chemotherapy resulted in a significantly lower incidence of lymphatic tumour recurrence (20%) compared to no treatment and placebo control animals (100%).  PLGA-PTX microspheres were seen in regional lymphatic tissue over 4 weeks after the sponge placement. &#xd;
It is concluded that the trans-lymphatic targeting drug delivery system described in this thesis may improve the control of lymphatic metastasis in lung cancer.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Multivariate Bayesian Process Control</dc:title>

<dc:subject>multivariate process control</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>Bayesian control chart</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Multivariate control charts are valuable tools for multivariate statistical process control (MSPC) used to monitor industrial processes and to detect abnormal process behavior. It has been shown in the literature that Bayesian control charts are optimal tools to control the process compared with the non-Bayesian charts. To use any control chart, three control chart parameters must be specified, namely the sample size, the sampling interval and the control limit. Traditionally, control chart design is based on its statistical performance. Recently, industrial practitioners and academic researchers have increasingly recognized the cost benefits obtained by applying the economically designed control charts to quality control, equipment condition monitoring, and maintenance decision-making. The primary objective of this research is to design multivariate Bayesian control charts (MVBCH) both for quality control and conditional-based maintenance (CBM) applications.&#xd;
&#xd;
Although considerable research has been done to develop MSPC tools under the assumption that the observations are independent, little attention has been given to the development of MSPC tools for monitoring multivariate autocorrelated processes. In this research, we compare the performance of the squared predication error (SPE) chart using a vector autoregressive moving average with exogenous variables (VARMAX) model and a partial least squares (PLS) model for a multivariate autocorrelated process. The study shows that the use of SPE control charts based on the VARMAX model allows rapid detection of process disturbances while reducing false alarms. &#xd;
&#xd;
Next, the economic and economic-statistical design of a MVBCH for quality control considering the control limit policy proved to be optimal by Makis(2007) is developed. The computational results illustrate that the MVBCH performs considerably better than the MEWMA chart, especially for smaller mean shifts. Sensitivity analyses further explore the impact of the misspecified out-of-control mean on the actual average cost. Finally, design of a MVBCH for CBM applications is considered using the same control limit policy structure and including an observable failure state. Optimization models for the economic and economic statistical design of the MVBCH for a 3 state CBM model are developed and comparison results show that the MVBCH performs better than recently developed CBM Chi-square chart.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>Spanish-English bilinguals, Tense and Aspect</dc:subject>
<dc:description>This thesis examines the L2 acquisition and L1 attrition of aspectual properties in Spanish. Specifically, it investigates preterite versus imperfect distinctions and the ongoing value of the Spanish present tense among English-speaking L2 learners and long-term Spanish immigrants. In contrast to previous research which explains L2 learners’ difficulties as a result of either maturational constraints or morphosyntactic development, this study provides a supplementary explanation focusing on L1 transfer of the semantic patterns of tense morphemes. &#xd;
The study proceeds by comparing data from L2 learners with that of long-term Spanish immigrants. Unlike what is argued for L2 acquisition difficulties, the difficulties immigrants may have with tense and aspect cannot stem solely from impairment reasons. These immigrants acquired the L2 as adults. Therefore, to the extent that L2 learners share similar patterns of errors with adult immigrants, L2 speakers’ difficulties cannot be unequivocally linked to causes related to impairment. Instead, following a selectional approach to aspectual variation (De Swart, 1998), it is argued that transfer of the selectional patterns of tense morphemes offers a more encompassing explanation of the difficulties L2 speakers face with tense and aspect. &#xd;
&#xd;
Data collection involved two truth-value judgment tasks, two acceptability judgment tasks and two elicited production tasks. Twenty long-term immigrants, twenty English-speaking L2 learners of Spanish, and twenty native speakers of Spanish serving as control participants took part in the study. Results show incorrect activation of aspectual patterns by both experimental groups and similar patterns of difficulties in some of the conditions under investigation. I conclude that transfer from the other language offers a more adequate explanation of the difficulties L2 learners face</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background: The incidence of inadequate empiric antibiotic therapy (IET) and its clinical importance as a risk factor for hospital mortality in Canadian solid-organ transplant patients remains unknown.&#xd;
Methods: This retrospective cohort study evaluated all patients admitted to a transplant unit from May/2002-April/2004. Therapy was considered adequate when the organism cultured was found to be susceptible to an antibiotic administered within 24 hours of the index sample collection time. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between potential determinants, IET, and mortality.&#xd;
Results: IET was administered in 169/312 (54%) transplant patients. Regression analysis demonstrated that an increasing duration of IET (adjusted OR at 24h, 1.33; p &lt; 0.001), ICU-associated infections (adjusted OR, 6.27; p &lt; 0.001), prior antibiotic use (adjusted OR, 3.56; p = 0.004), and increasing APACHE-II scores (adjusted OR, 1.26; p &lt; 0.001), were independent determinants of hospital mortality.&#xd;
Conclusions: IET is common and appears to be an important determinant of hospital mortality in the Canadian transplant population.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Among several difficulties associated with immigration, acculturation process has been&#xd;

incidence of mental disorders. The strategies adopted by individuals to deal with the&#xd;
acculturation process appear to be predictive of different mental health outcomes. This&#xd;
exploratory study investigated the relationship between acculturation strategies and the&#xd;
occurrence of symptoms of depression in the context of the Brazilian immigrant community&#xd;

were the predominant strategies for this sample and that acculturation strategies failed to serve as&#xd;
significant predictors of depression scores. However, participants with Separation as their&#xd;
predominant acculturation strategy exhibited higher depressive symptom endorsement. The&#xd;
significance of these findings in the context of previous research as well as its implications for&#xd;
future research and critical multicultural practice in mental health are discussed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The design of optimal strictly positive real (SPR) compensators using numerical optimization&#xd;
is considered. The plants to be controlled are linear and nonlinear flexible manipulators.&#xd;
For the design of SISO and MIMO linear SPR controllers, the optimization&#xd;
objective function is defined by reformulating the H2-optimal control problem subject&#xd;
to the constraint that the controllers must be SPR. Various controller parameterizations&#xd;
using transfer functions/matrices and state-space equations are considered. Depending&#xd;
on the controller form, constraints are enforced (i) using simple inequalities guaranteeing&#xd;
SPRness, (ii) in the frequency domain, or (iii) by implementing the Kalman-Yakubovich-&#xd;
Popov lemma. The design of a gain-scheduled SPR controller using numerical optimization&#xd;
is also considered. Using a family of linear SPR controllers, the time dependent&#xd;
scheduling signals are parameterized, and the objective function of the optimizer seeks&#xd;
to find the form of the scheduling signals which minimizes the manipulator tip tracking&#xd;
error while minimizing the control effort.</dc:description>

<dc:title>First-order Decision-theoretic Planning in Structured Relational Environments</dc:title>

<dc:contributor>Boutilier, Craig </dc:contributor>
<dc:contributor>Computer Science</dc:contributor>
<dc:description>We consider the general framework of first-order decision-theoretic planning in structured relational environments.  Most traditional solution approaches to these planning problems ground the relational specification w.r.t. a specific domain instantiation and apply a solution approach directly to the resulting ground Markov decision process (MDP).  Unfortunately, the space and time complexity of these solution algorithms scale linearly with the domain size in the best case and exponentially in the worst case.  An alternate approach to grounding a relational planning problem is to lift it to a first-order MDP (FOMDP) specification.  This FOMDP can then be solved directly, resulting in a domain-independent solution whose space and time complexity either do not scale with domain size or can scale sublinearly in the domain size.  However, such generality does not come without its own set of challenges and the first purpose of this thesis is to explore exact and approximate solution techniques for practically solving FOMDPs.  The second purpose of this thesis is to extend the FOMDP specification to succinctly capture factored actions and additive rewards while extending the exact and approximate solution techniques to directly exploit this structure.  In addition, we provide a proof of correctness of the first-order symbolic dynamic programming approach w.r.t. its well-studied ground MDP counterpart.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Building on recent work in economic geography, evolutionary economics, and international business, I examine how firms that enter from outside a region alter the knowledge and opportunity structure for potential entrepreneurial entrants and indigenous incumbents in that region. In particular, I examine the short and long run effects of both greenfield and acquisition entry on entrepreneurial entry, as well as on the exit and growth of indigenous incumbents in industry clusters. A comprehensive dataset of all firms in the Canadian biotech industry between 1976 and 2003 is used to study the dynamic effects within all regions that have experienced an external entry. The results show a complex set of processes at work. Newer greenfield and acquisition entrants have consistently opposing effects, with newer greenfields enhancing entrepreneurial entry, but dampening growth and survival of indigenous incumbents in the longer run. Older greenfields, those that have a long presence in a given region and are primarily traditional pharmaceutical firms, have a similar effect to that of acquisitions. Moreover, the level of agglomeration moderates the influence of ‘outsiders’ on the indigenous industry, especially in the case of acquisitions. The results suggest that legal constraints on labor mobility barriers have an important influence on the observed patterns. The overall patterns suggest that the search and site selection of outsiders is an important mechanism driving local industry evolution, complementary to other traditional mechanisms.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Agents with differential constraints, although common in the real world, pose&#xd;
a particular difficulty for motion planning algorithms.  Methods for solving&#xd;
such problems are still relatively slow and inefficient.  In particular,&#xd;
current motion planners generally can neither "see" the world around them,&#xd;
nor generalize from experience.  That is, their reliance on collision tests as&#xd;
the only means of sensing the environment yields a tactile, myopic perception&#xd;
of the world.  Such short-sightedness greatly limits any potential for&#xd;
detection, learning, or reasoning about frequently encountered situations.  In&#xd;
result these methods solve each problem in exactly the same way, whether the&#xd;
first or the hundredth time they attempt it, each time none the wiser.  The&#xd;
key component of this thesis proposes a general approach for motion planning&#xd;
in which local sensory information, in conjunction with prior accumulated&#xd;
experience, are exploited to improve planner performance. The approach relies&#xd;
on learning viability models for the agent's "perceptual space", and the use&#xd;
thereof to direct planning effort.  In addition, a method is presented for&#xd;
improving runtimes of the RRT motion planning algorithm in heavily constrained&#xd;
search-spaces, a common feature for agents with differential constraints.&#xd;
Finally, the thesis explores the use of viability models for maintaing safe&#xd;
operation of user-controlled agents, a related application which could be&#xd;
harnessed to yield additional, more "natural" experience data for further&#xd;
improving motion planning.</dc:description>

<dc:title>The F-box protein FSN-1 Functions in an SCF-like Ubiquitin Ligase Complex to Regulate Synapse Formation</dc:title>

<dc:description>The chemical synapse is an asymmetric structure consisting of presynaptic and postsynaptic terminals in direct apposition to each other. Synapses function to mediate the transmission of signals between neurons and their targets.  The formation of synapses is a tightly regulated process requiring the interaction of many genes and molecular pathways.  I am interested in identifying genes and signaling pathways that are required for proper synapse formation.&#xd;
Using the GABAergic neuromuscular junctions of C. elegans as a model system, I have identified fsn-1 (F-box synaptic protein), a gene required for the control of synaptic growth.  fsn-1 mutants exhibit a synaptic defect characterized by both synaptic over differentiation and under differentiation.  FSN-1 is an F-box protein with a SPRY (SPla and RYanodine receptor) domain that functions cell-autonomously in neurons to regulate synaptic growth.  I have shown that it functions in an E3 ubiquitin ligase-like complex with the RING-H2 finger protein RPM-1 (Regulator of presynaptic morphology), SKR-1 and Cullin.  The composition of this complex is similar to SCF (Skp1, Cullin, F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligases.  We hypothesize that this complex controls synapse formation by down regulating synapse promoting factors through an ubiquitin mediated process.&#xd;
We have identified two receptor tyrosine kinases that genetically interact with fsn-1, the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase homolog SCD-2 (Suppressor of Constitutive Dauer) and the C. elegans insulin receptor DAF-2 (abnormal DAuer Formation).  Loss of function mutations in scd-2 or daf-2 partially suppress the synaptic differentiation defects of fsn-1 mutants, suggesting that they participate in signaling pathways whose activities are normally inhibited by FSN-1 during synapse formation.  Unlike FSN-1 that functions in GABAergic neurons, I found that SCD-2 and DAF-2 have cell non-autonomous functions at GABAergic neuromuscular junctions. SCD-2 is required in the nervous system in the RID interneuron where it could modulate synapse formation through ligands present on the motoneuron cell surface.  The DAF-2/insulin pathway functions in postsynaptic muscle cells to regulate FSN-1 dependent presynaptic growth likely through a retrograde or feedback mechanism.  I propose a model where FSN-1 regulates synapse formation by attenuating signals that converge upon the presynaptic terminal to stimulate or inhibit synaptic growth.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>Pain</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Activation of nociceptors causes them to secrete neuropeptides, such as substance P (SP) and calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP).  By reacting with receptors on blood vessels these peptides contribute to inflammation by evoking vasodilation and increasing vascular permeability that allows proteins and fluid to leave the blood vessels (plasma extravasation, PE).   These substances can also lead to the sensitization of nociceptors and the resulting positive feedback thereby prolongs inflammation and pain.  Thus, blocking the release of neuropeptides may have important therapeutic value in pain conditions where neuropeptides have been implicated.   Therefore, the aim of this study was to define the time course of changes in vascular permeability and to test the ability of novel agents to modulate this response.  PE and vasodilation was evoked by stimulating the saphenous nerve or by injecting the chemical irritant capsaicin into the rat hindpaw. Changes in blood flow were evaluated with a laser Doppler and digitized image analysis was used to measure changes in reflectance of the skin due to accumulation of extravasated (EB) dye.   Analysis of the change in pixel intensity in the digitized images revealed that the magnitude of PE was dependent on the stimulus pulse number.   Moreover, the time course of enhanced vascular permeability produced by electrical stimulation was a transient event compared to a much longer response with capsaicin.  It was also demonstrated that sumatriptan, (a 5-HT1B/D receptor agonist) and botulinum neurotoxin type-A were effective treatments for capsaicin and saphenous nerve induced vasodilation and PE.  Neither drug interfered with activation of the SP or CGRP receptor, which may suggest that both drugs work by inhibiting neuropeptide release.  Therefore, this study has described the time course of vascular permeability evoked by two different stimuli and has demonstrated the ability of two novel agents to attenuate these responses.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>Nonparametric estimation</dc:subject>
<dc:description>In this thesis, we try to provide a broad&#xd;
econometric analysis of a class of risk measures, distortion risk measures (DRM). With carefully selected functional form, the&#xd;
Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Tail-VaR (TVaR) are special cases of DRMs. Besides, the DRM also admits interpretation in the sense of&#xd;
non-expected utility type of preferences. &#xd;
&#xd;
We first provide a unified statistical framework for the nonparametric estimators of&#xd;
the DRMs in a univariate case. The asymptotic properties of both the&#xd;
DRMs and their sensitivities with respect to the parameters representing risk aversion and/or pessimism are derived. Moreover,&#xd;
the relationships between the VaR and TVaR are also investigated in detail, which, we hope, can shed new lights on the way passing one risk measure to another. Then, the analysis of DRMs are extended to a multi-dimensional framework, where the DRM is computed for a portfolio consisting of many primitive assets. Analogous to the&#xd;
mean-variance frontier analysis, we study the efficient portfolio frontier when both objective and constraint are replaced by the&#xd;
DRMs. We call this the DRM-DRM framework. Under a nonparametric setting, we propose three asymptotic test statistics for evaluating the efficiency of a given portfolio. Finally, we discuss the&#xd;
criteria used for evaluating models used to forecast the VaRs. More precisely, we propose a criterion which takes into account the loss levels beyond the VaRs.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In order to address the disconnection between the governing and the governed in our &#xd;
democracies and bureaucracies, many practitioners and academics are looking at models &#xd;
such as participatory governance to increase empowerment and foster better decision- &#xd;
making.  Although this model has some encouraging possibilities, there are challenges to &#xd;
implementing an empowering and participatory process. To better understand these &#xd;
issues, this research focused on tenant representatives’ understanding and experience of &#xd;
their role in a recently implemented participatory process in the Toronto Community &#xd;
Housing Corporation.  Representatives reported taking on extensive responsibilities to &#xd;
improve their communities and interviews with tenants suggested empowerment and &#xd;
citizenship were often products of tenant participation. The research also found &#xd;
limitations on empowerment and the extent to which tenants saw themselves as agents &#xd;
and decision-makers in the Tenant Participation System. The paper connects how &#xd;
structure and education impacts the possibilities for agency and empowerment of &#xd;
participants.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Background and objectives&#xd;
&#xd;
Evidence suggests that circulating IGF-I levels increase mammographic density (a breast cancer risk factor) and breast cancer risk in premenopausal women. The objective of this thesis was to examine the association of genetic variation at the IGF1 gene with IGF-I concentration, mammographic density, breast cancer risk, and related anthropometric measures in premenopausal women.&#xd;
&#xd;
Methods&#xd;
&#xd;
Three IGF1 CA repeat polymorphisms (at the 5′ and 3′ ends, and in intron 2) were genotyped. A cross-sectional design was used to investigate their associations with IGF-I levels, mammographic density, BMI, weight, and height. Families from registries in Ontario and Australia were used to investigate associations with breast cancer risk and also BMI, weight and height.&#xd;
Results&#xd;
In the cross-sectional study, greater number of copies of the 5′ 19 allele were associated with lower circulating IGF-I levels. Greater number of 3′ 185 alleles were associated with greater percentage breast density, smaller amount of non-dense tissue, and lower BMI. Including BMI in regression models removed the association of the 3′ 185 allele with percentage breast density.&#xd;
In the family based study, nominally significant associations (5′ 21 allele, intron 2 212 allele, intron 2 216 allele) with breast cancer risk were observed, but significance was lost after multiple comparison adjustment. There was a stronger association between the intron 2 216 allele and risk under a recessive model, and 5′ allele groupings of length 18 to 20 and 20 or more repeats produced significant positive and negative associations respectively. These associations were not strongly supported in analyses stratified by registry. Results from the family based study did not support an association between genetic variation at IGF1 with BMI, weight or height.&#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions&#xd;
&#xd;
No specific IGF1 variant influenced each of circulating IGF-I levels, mammographic density, and breast cancer risk. The failure to replicate the association of the 3′ 185 allele with BMI in the family based study suggests that the association of the 3′ 185 allele with percentage breast density is spurious, since this association was mediated through the relationship with BMI (suggesting IGF-I action on body fat). Evidence for an association between IGF1 and breast cancer risk was limited.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>dynamic optimization interpretation</dc:subject>
<dc:subject>branch prediction</dc:subject>
<dc:description>The implementation of new programming languages benefits from&#xd;
interpretation because it is simple, flexible and portable. The only&#xd;
downside is speed of execution, as there remains a large performance&#xd;
gap between even efficient interpreters and systems that include a&#xd;
just-in-time (JIT) compiler. Augmenting an interpreter with a JIT,&#xd;
however, is not a small task.  Today, Java JITs are typically&#xd;
method-based. To compile whole methods, the JIT must re-implement&#xd;
much functionality already provided by the interpreter, leading to a ``big&#xd;
bang'' development effort before the JIT can be deployed.  Adding a&#xd;
JIT to an interpreter would be easier if we could more gradually shift&#xd;
from dispatching virtual instructions bodies implemented for the interpreter&#xd;
to running instructions compiled into native code by the JIT.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
We show that virtual instructions implemented as lightweight callable&#xd;
routines can form the basis for a very efficient interpreter. Our new&#xd;
technique, interpreted traces, identifies hot paths, or traces, as a&#xd;
virtual program is interpreted. By exploiting the way traces predict&#xd;
branch destinations our technique markedly reduces branch&#xd;
mispredictions caused by dispatch. Interpreted traces are a&#xd;
high-performance technique, running about 25% faster than direct&#xd;
threading.&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
We show that interpreted traces are a good starting point for a&#xd;
trace-based JIT. We extend our interpreter so traces may contain a&#xd;
mixture of compiled code for some virtual instructions and calls to&#xd;
virtual instruction bodies for others. By compiling about 50 integer&#xd;
and object virtual instructions to machine code we improve performance&#xd;
by about 30% over interpreted traces, running about twice as fast as&#xd;
the direct threaded system with which we started.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Solar energy harvesting demands low-cost energy conversion in the infrared from 1 – 2 μm. However, solution-processed photovoltaic devices have remained relatively inefficient in this spectral region. Herein, lead sulfide colloidal nanocrystal quantum dots are used to facilitate efficient infrared power conversion. Solution-cast nanocrystal films are employed in a simple metal/semiconductor/metal architecture to produce a photovoltaic effect. It is shown that a Schottky barrier is induced, which is responsible for the charge separating action. Through optimization of chemical processes and device fabrication, the photovoltaic response is maximized. The infrared power conversion efficiency reaches 4.2%, which sets a new precedent for solution-processed photovoltaic cells. Furthermore, the devices exhibit efficient broadband solar power conversion and show promise for multijunction cell architectures. Carrier drift through a large depletion region near the Schottky contact is determined to be the dominant transport mechanism.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Elevated circulating free fatty acids (FFA) cause hepatic insulin resistance; however, the mechanisms for this process are incompletely understood. The objective of the studies in the thesis was to examine whether protein kinase C (PKC)-delta (d), oxidative stress, and the serine kinase IkBa kinase (IKK) B are causally involved in FFA-induced hepatic insulin resistance. To test this, we infused rats with lipid with or without inhibitors of the aforementioned factors for 7h, during the last 2h of which a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp was performed. In Study 1, inhibition of hepatic PKC-d using antisense oligonucleotide prevented FFA-induced membrane translocation of PKC-d, which is a marker of its activation, in parallel with prevention of lipid-induced hepatic insulin resistance, without affecting lipid-induced peripheral insulin resistance. These results implicate PKC-d as a causal mediator of FFA-induced hepatic insulin resistance. In Study 2, the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) prevented lipid-induced hepatic insulin resistance in conjunction with reversal of lipid-induced increase in markers of IKKB and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) activation, and of impairment of insulin signaling, without affecting PKC-d membrane translocation and increase in phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) induced by lipid infusion. These findings suggested that oxidative stress is a causal mediator of lipid-induced hepatic insulin resistance upstream of IKKB and JNK1, and potentially downstream of PKC-d and p38 MAPK. In Study 3, sodium salicylate, an IKKB inhibitor, prevented FFA-induced hepatic insulin resistance via restoration of hepatic insulin signaling, thus implicating IKKB as a causal factor in the process. Together, the results from these studies demonstrate that PKC-d, oxidative stress, and IKKB are causally involved in FFA-induced hepatic insulin resistance and suggest that the sequence for the process is: FFA -> PKC-d -> oxidative stress -> IKKB -> impaired hepatic insulin signaling.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>Normalization</dc:subject>
<dc:description>In this dissertation, we propose new design guidelines to reduce the amount of redundancy that databases carry. We use techniques from information theory to define a measure that evaluates a database design based on the worst possible redundancy carried in the instances. We then continue by revisiting the design problem of relational data with functional dependencies, and measure the lowest price, in terms of redundancy, that has to be paid to guarantee a dependency-preserving normalization for all schemas. We provide a formal justification for the Third Normal Form (3NF) by showing that we can achieve this lowest price by doing a good 3NF normalization.&#xd;
&#xd;
We then study the design problem for XML documents that are views of relational data. We show that we can design a redundancy-free XML representation for some relational schemas while preserving all data dependencies. We present an algorithm for converting a relational schema to such an XML design. &#xd;
&#xd;
We finally study the design problem for XML documents that are stored in relational databases. We look for XML design criteria that ensure a relational storage with low redundancy. First, we characterize XML designs that have a redundancy-free relational storage. Then we propose a restrictive condition for XML functional dependencies that guarantees a low redundancy for data values in the relational storage.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>Axon Pruning</dc:subject>
<dc:description>The formation of neural connections in the mammalian nervous system is a complex process. During development, axons are initially overproduced and compete for limited quantities of target-derived growth factors. Axons which participate in functional circuits and secure appropriate amounts of growth factors are stabilized, while those axons that are either inappropriately connected or do not obtain sufficient concentrations of growth factors are eliminated in a process termed ‘axon pruning’. In this thesis, I examined the mechanisms that regulate pruning of peripheral, NGF-dependent sympathetic neurons that project to the eye. I determined that pruning of these projections in vivo requires the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) and synthesis of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) from the activity-dependent exon IV promoter. Furthermore, analysis of an in vitro model of axon competition, which is regulated by the interplay between nerve growth factor (NGF) and neuronal activity, revealed that p75NTR and BDNF are also essential for axon competition in culture. In this model, in the presence of NGF, neural activity confers a competitive growth advantage to stimulated, active axons by enhancing downstream TrkA (NGF receptor) signaling locally in axons. More interestingly, the unstimulated, inactive axons deriving from the same and neighboring neurons acquire a "growth disadvantage" due to secreted BDNF acting through p75NTR, which induces axon degeneration by suppressing TrkA signaling that is essential for axonal integrity. These data support a model where, during developmental axon competition, successful axons secrete BDNF in an activity-dependent fashion which activates p75NTR on unsuccessful neighboring axons, suppressing TrkA signaling, and ultimately promoting pruning by a degenerative mechanism.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) may be linked to the attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), but it is unclear whether this phenomenon pertains to the pancreatic beta cell. In this study, a UCP2-deficient mouse model was used to assess the importance of UCP2 to beta cell viability. We investigated the effect of UCP2 absence in response to a beta cell cytotoxic model of diabetes induction. In vivo treatment by the cytotoxic agent streptozotocin led to overall beta cell loss, but severity was not exacerbated by UCP2 deficiency. We also examined ROS production and cell viability in islet cells exposed to various stressors associated with oxidative stress. In vitro measurements of ROS and cell death in islet cells demonstrated that the response was not influenced by UCP2 expression. In contrast with UCP2 overexpression studies showing cytoprotection, this study reveals that beta cell survival is not compromised by the absence of UCP2.</dc:description>

Abstract&#xd;
&#xd;
Academic tools have been used in many research studies to investigate Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) architecture, but these tools are not sufficiently flexible to represent modern commercial devices. This thesis describes two new tools, the Dynamic Clusterer (DC) and the Dynamic Placer (DP) that perform the clustering and placement steps in the FPGA CAD flow. These tools are developed in direct extension of the popular Versatile Place and Route (VPR) academic tools. We describe the changes that are necessary to the traditional tools in order to model modern devices, and provide experimental results that show the quality of the algorithms achieved is similar to a commercial CAD tool, Quartus II. Finally, a small number of research experiments were investigated using the clustering and placement tools created to demonstrate the practical use of these tools for academic research studies of FPGA CAD tools.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>Environment</dc:subject>
<dc:description>“The Disposable Camera” theorizes the relationship between the cinematic image and energy resources. Framed by the emergent carbon-neutral cinema, the recent UCLA report on the film industry’s environmental footprint, as well as common perceptions about digital sustainability,  “The Disposable Camera” posits that cinema has always been aware of its connection to the environment, the realm from which it sources its power, raw materials and, often enough, subject matter. But because the natural environment is so inextricably embedded within film’s basic means of production, distribution and reception, its effects remain as overlooked as they are complex. &#xd;
“The Disposable Camera” argues that cinematic history and theory can and indeed ought to be reappraised against the emerging ascendancy of environmental politics, all films; as such, all cinema could logically be included within the analytical parameters of this project. Primary focus, however, is given to documentary cinema, as well as notable experimental and narrative films. Selected texts do not overtly represent an environmental issue; rather, they reflexively engage with and theorize themselves as films, thus addressing the technological, industrial, and resource-derived essence of the moving image. Of import here are films that reveal how specific formal or aesthetic choices evidence and critique the ideology attached to resource consumption and/ or abuse. While it composes a distinctly environmental trajectory of the cinematic image, this project likewise historicizes and critiques these same stages and also challenges the utopian and/ or apocalyptical tendencies challenging eco-politics. Additionally, “The Disposable Camera” is committed to mapping out the shift from a distinctly tangible celluloid-based cinematic infrastructure to the ostensibly immaterial form of digital filmmaking. Indeed, the tension that now pits cinema’s material past against its immaterial future corresponds with the decline of natural reality on the one hand and the rise of cyber realities on the other, a parallel condition that fully evidences the increasingly palpable overlap between environmental and cinematic politics.</dc:description>

The accuracy of ribosomal protein synthesis depends on the fidelity of highly specific enzymes, aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, towards amino acid – tRNA pairs. These biological catalysts are responsible for activating the amino acids as aminoacyl adenylates and for their subsequent attachment to the 2’- or 3’-OH at the 3’-terminal of the correct tRNA to give aminoacyl-tRNA. &#xd;
Extended diversity in protein structure and function could be achieved if non-natural side chains can be introduced in protein synthesis. This requires that the acceptor stem of a tRNA molecule be synthetically aminoacylated. The most widely used methods for charging tRNA with non-natural amino acids involve multi-step synthesis of an aminoacyl-pCpA and its consequent enzymatic ligation to truncated tRNA. No direct route to these species has been reported. &#xd;
We have developed a method for direct biomimetic aminoacylation of the 3’-terminal hydroxyls of tRNA. Our approach shows to be promising in reactions leading to direct 2’- or 3’-O-aminoacylation of not only nucleosides and nucleotides but also RNA in general and tRNA in particular.&#xd;
The system we have developed provides: 1) efficient activation of the amino acids as aminoacyl phosphates, analogues of the enzymatic intermediates, and 2) specific recognition of the 3’-terminal of tRNA by lanthanide ions present in the reaction. The aminoacylating reagents used in our studies were carefully selected to provide handles to follow the reaction: UV absorbance, fluorescence spectroscopy and 19F NMR. Lanthanide (III) ions can play a role similar to a key part of the aminoacyl tRNA synthetases – they bring the aminoacyl close to the 3’-terminal of tRNA, in this case by forming a bis-bidentate complex with the aminoacyl phosphate and the 2’,3’-diol functionality of the 3’-terminal adenosine. This process relies on the specificity towards the unique 3’-terminal diol on tRNA, provided by the metal ion and the simultaneous complexation of the aminoacyl phosphate.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) is a major DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway. NHEJ is initiated through DSB recognition by the DNA end-binding heterodimer, Ku, while end-joining is accomplished by the XRCC4-DNA ligase IV (X4L4) complex. This thesis reports that APLF (Aprataxin and Polynucleotide kinase-Like Factor), an endo/exonuclease with a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain and two unique zinc fingers (ZF), interacts with both Ku and X4L4. The APLF-X4L4 interaction is FHA- and phospho-dependent, and is mediated by CK2 phosphorylation of XRCC4 in vitro. APLF binds Ku independently of the FHA and ZF domains, and complexes with Ku at DNA ends. APLF undergoes ionizing radiation induced ATM-dependent hyperphosphorylation and ATM phosphorylates APLF in vitro. Downregulation of APLF is associated with defective NHEJ and impaired DSB repair kinetics. These results suggest that APLF is an ATM target that is involved in NHEJ and facilitates DSB repair, likely via interactions with Ku and X4L4.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Calcium phosphate cements are produced by the mixing of calcium phosphate powders in an aqueous solution resulting in a low-temperature synthesized hydroxyapatite. They have been used as bone substitutes and drug delivery systems. The present work examined the possibility of a machine-based modification to this process to derive a standardized preparation method of calcium phosphate cements that could be loaded with Pantoprazole. To examine the characteristics of these novel materials, the following analyses of hand- and machine-made cements, with and without Pantoprazole were undertaken: in vitro surface characterization, dissolution, hydroxyapatite conversion, Pantoprazole delivery, as well as in vivo reparative bone formation and particulate degradation. The in vitro surface characterization, dissolution at different pHs, and drug release analyses showed insignificant differences between hand- and machine-prepared cements. However, machine-made cements showed increased hydroxyapatite conversion, decreased dissolution at pH 7.4, and better in vivo outcomes than commercially available bone-substitute particulate biomaterials.</dc:description>

<dc:description>We explore the relationships between the computational problem of recognizing expander graphs, and the problem of efficiently approximating proof length in the well-known system of \emph{resolution}. This program builds upon known connections between graph expansion and resolution lower bounds.&#xd;
&#xd;
A proof system $P$ is \emph{(quasi-)automatizable} if there is a search algorithm which finds a $P$-proof of a given formula $f$ in time (quasi)polynomial in the length of a shortest $P$-proof of $f$. It is open whether resolution is (quasi-)automatizable. We prove several conditional non-automatizability results for resolution modulo new conjectures concerning the complexity of identifying bipartite expander graphs. Our reductions use a natural family of formulas and exploit the well-known relationships between expansion and length of resolution proofs. Our hardness assumptions are unsupported; we survey known results as progress towards establishing their plausibility. The major contribution is a conditional hardness result for the quasi-automatizability of resolution.</dc:description>

ABSTRACT&#xd;
&#xd;
	A systematic review and four focus groups were conducted to determine the facilitators and barriers of physical activity in older adults who have experienced a fall.  Results from the systematic review demonstrated facilitators and barriers of purposeful and non-purposeful physical activity for older adults, but not specifically fallers.  Facilitators identified in the systematic review and elaborated upon in the focus groups involving older fallers included: deriving benefits from physical activity in the physical, psychological, or functional realms; and social support providing encouragement for participation in physical activity, or acting as a distraction from negative physical symptoms during participation in group physical activity. Conversely, barriers to purposeful and non-purposeful physical activity included: symptoms of chronic illnesses, such as cardiac chest pain, arthritic pain, poor balance or poor eyesight; a fear of falling; and adverse physical environmental conditions, such as cold or warm, humid weather.  The focus groups identified disinclination to activity as an important barrier to purposeful physical activity.  When placed in a theoretical context such as Bandura’s Social Cognitive Theory and Marcus and Owen’s Readiness for Change model, the results of this study can help inform the design of physical activity interventions to prevent falls in older adults with a history of falls.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Dioxins are environmental contaminants that raise concern because they are potent and persistent. The most potent dioxin congener, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), causes a wide variety of biochemical and toxic effects in laboratory animals and in humans. Major toxicities of TCDD are initiated by their binding to the AH receptor (AHR), a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates expression of numerous genes.  However, the specific genes whose dysregulation leads to major toxicities such as wasting, hepatotoxicity, and lethality are unknown. The objective of this thesis research was to identify the molecular mechanisms by which dioxins cause lethality.  To this end, a powerful genetic rat model was utilized – the Han/Wistar (Kuopio) rat which is highly resistant to dioxin toxicity due to a major deletion in the AHR’s transactivation domain (TAD) leading to 3 potential AHR variant transcripts. We found that insertion-variant transcripts (IVs) are the dominant forms of AHR expressed in H/W rats, constitutively and after TCDD treatment. Gene expression array analysis revealed that the total number of TCDD-responsive genes in liver was significantly lower in H/W rats (that carry the TAD deletion) than in dioxin-sensitive rats (that carry wildtype AHR). Genes that are well-known to be AHR-regulated and dioxin-inducible  such as CYP1 transcripts  remained responsive to TCDD in H/W rats; thus the TAD deletion selectively interferes with expression of a subset of hepatic genes rather than abolishing global AHR-mediated responses. Genes that differed in response to TCDD between dioxin-sensitive rats and dioxin-resistant rats are integral parts of pathways known to be disrupted by dioxin treatment such as protein synthesis/degradation, fatty acid transport/metabolism, and apoptosis. These genes are worthy candidates for further mechanistic studies to test their role in major dioxin toxicities. Numerous differentially-regulated genes were downregulated;  however, microRNAs, which downregulate mRNA levels in other systems, likely play no role in downregulation of mRNAs by dioxins in adult liver and are unlikely to be involved in hepatotoxicity. Findings in this research support the hypothesis that H/W rats are resistant to TCDD lethality because the TAD deletion prevents the AHR from dysregulating specific mRNA transcripts but not hepatic miRNAs.</dc:description>

Introduction:  Hepatopulmonary Syndrome is a rare disease characterized by abnormal gas-exchange and a poor prognosis, with no known effective medical therapy.  A rat model and preliminary human data suggest that this disease may be caused by intestinal bacterial overgrowth, systemic endotoxemia and increased nitric oxide.  Methods:  We conducted a pilot crossover randomized controlled trial of norfloxacin versus placebo over four weeks, in seven subjects with HPS or a milder condition called pre-HPS, with a primary outcome of alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (AaDO2).  Results:  There was no trend toward improved AaDO2, this outcome and other intermediate outcomes were highly variable, and results suggested that a longer treatment course might be necessary.  We identified multiple obstacles to recruitment.  Conclusion:  We believe that a full-scale study of norfloxacin therapy for HPS will require 1) a six-month therapeutic period, 2) more specific HPS diagnostic criteria for clinical and study populations, and 3) creative recruitment maneuvers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Minimum impact construction for bridge building is a growing demand in modern urban environments. Pre-cast segmental construction is one solution that offers low-impact, economical, and aesthetically pleasing bridges. The standardization of pre-cast concrete sections and segments has facilitated an improved level of economy in pre-cast construction.  Through the development of high performance materials such as high strength fibre-reinforced concrete (FRC), further economy in pre-cast segmental construction may be realized.  The design of pre-cast bridges using high-strength FRC and external unbonded tendons for cantilever construction may provide an economical, low-impact alternative to overpass bridge design.&#xd;
This thesis investigates the feasibility and possible savings that can be realized for a single cell box girder bridge with thin concrete sections post-tensioned exclusively with external unbonded tendons in the longitudinal direction. A cantilever-constructed single cell box girder with a curtailed arrangement of external unbonded tendons is examined.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A new open source 3D reconstruction and evaluation pipeline is described, with a thorough description of the algorithms employed.  A new evaluation framework is introduced, which is easy to use for comparison of state-of-the-art multiview reconstruction algorithms. The evaluation framework also includes tools for creating data sets which have ground truth. The source code is available under the GPL; a first for a complete end-to-end reconstruction system.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study presents an account of experiences of recent immigrant women professionals in negotiating labour market opportunities after arriving in Canada. The purpose of this research is to bring in immigrant women’s perspectives on immigration and employment study. Six immigrant women professionals from different cultural backgrounds were interviewed within the framework of qualitative research. Informed by feminist theories, this study intended to make women’s experience in post-arrival integration and settlement more visible and prominent. Research findings indicate both labour market and household factors contributed to shape the labour market experience of immigrant women professionals of recent years. Their experiences reveal the complicated social relations of their doubly burdened and triply oppressed location.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Nanocrystal solids represent an exciting new class of materials. These are often referred&#xd;
to as artificial solids, in which the nanocrystals take the place of atoms in traditional solids.&#xd;
This thesis reports the utility of field-effect transistor measurements to elucidate&#xd;
charge transport parameters, such as charge carrier density and charge carrier mobility&#xd;
in a nanocrystal solid. The evolution of these parameters with chemical treatments&#xd;
is followed and correlated to improved performance in photovoltaic devices. Chemical&#xd;
treatments are demonstrated to simultaneously engineer interparticle spacing, doping and electronic coupling in nanocrystal solids. The nanocrystal solids are then utilized as building blocks for fabricating all nanocrystal heterostructure. A type-I nanocrystal heterostructure is fabricated to demonstrate efficient electroluminescent device in the&#xd;
infrared communications wavelength. The device emits at peak wavelength of 1.58 um&#xd;
with an effciency of 0.5%.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Closed captioning has not improved since early 1970s, while film and television technology has changed dramatically. Closed captioning only conveys verbatim dialogue to the audience while ignoring music, sound effects and speech prosody. Thus, caption viewers receive limited and often erroneous information. My thesis research attempts to add some of the missing sounds and emotions back into captioning using animated text. &#xd;
The study involved two animated caption styles and one conventional style: enhanced, extreme and closed. All styles were applied to two clips with animations for happiness, sadness, anger, fear and disgust emotions. Twenty-five hard of hearing and hearing participants viewed and commented on the three caption styles and also identified the character’s emotions. The study revealed that participants preferred enhanced, animated captions. Enhanced captions appeared to improve access to the emotive information in the content. Also, the animation for fear appeared to be most easily understood by the participants.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Does Aging Act to Maximize or Minimize Cultural Differences in Cognitive Processing Style? Evidence from Eye Movements during Scene Perception</dc:title>

<dc:subject>eye-tracking</dc:subject>
<dc:description>There is evidence to suggest that people from different cultures have different cognitive processing styles. For example, by measuring the eye movements of American and Chinese students when viewing pictures, Chua, Boland, and Nisbett (2005) found that American students fixated more on the focal object, whereas Chinese students fixated more on the background.  In a subsequent object-recognition task, the Chinese students were less likely to correctly recognize old objects presented in new backgrounds than Americans did. This study used a similar scene-viewing task to investigate whether aging modulates these cultural differences in cognitive processing style. Like Chua et al., we found that young Chinese students spent longer fixating the background than did their Western counterparts. However, we failed to replicate the accompanying memory bias observed by Chua et al. Our strongest finding was that maintaining the original background facilitated memory for objects in young participants of both cultures but not for older participants. This result suggests that older adults had poorer memory for background details and/or had poorer integration of object and background.</dc:description>

<dc:description>From June 2006 to March 2007, the concentrations of water soluble inorganic&#xd;
particulates and their associated precursor gases were semi-continuously measured&#xd;
adjacent to a high traffic street in downtown Toronto, Canada. Measurements underwent&#xd;
extensive quality assurance and control protocols. Seasonal and diurnal variations in&#xd;
HNO3 and NH3 partitioning to NH4NO3 were observed. Long range transported air&#xd;
masses from southwest of Toronto were the predominant source of measured SO4&#xd;
2- for all seasons. The contributing sources of PM2.5 nitrate mass fluctuated between seasons: pNO3- was predominantly locally derived in the summer and resulted from long range transport in the winter. Comparison between measurements and ISORROPIA&#xd;
thermodynamic model predictions identified model weaknesses and was used to explore&#xd;
the effect of modulating primary gas concentrations on consequent particulate levels. SO2 emissions reductions were the most influential and direct method to reduce overall PM2.5 concentrations; however, limiting ammonia emissions was also another successful strategy.</dc:description>

<dc:description>NCA-1 (putative nematode calcium channel) and NCA-2 are two cation channel-like proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans that function redundantly to regulate locomotion through unknown mechanisms.  A recent study from our lab showed that in vivo Ca2+ imaging analyses of egg-laying neurons in nca-1 loss- and gain-of-function mutants implicate that NCA channels regulate Ca2+ flux at synapses, without affecting Ca2+ dynamics in neuron somas.  Furthermore, we observed that NCA-1 localizes to non-synaptic region along axons, strongly suggesting that NCA channels propagate electrical signals from cell bodies to synapses.  To identify molecular components that function in the nca-1 genetic pathway, I performed a genetic suppressor screen that led to the identification of behavioral suppressors of nca-1 gain-of-function mutant.  Possible NCA auxiliary subunits, UNC-79 (uncoordinated) and UNC-80, were identified from this screen.  Molecular characterization of other suppressors will help to identify other regulators and downstream signaling components through which NCA channels transmit electrical signals.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mounting evidence suggests that the superposition of anatomical clutter in x-ray chest radiography poses a major impediment to the detectability of subtle lung nodules. Through decomposition of projections acquired using different x-ray energy spectra, dual-energy (DE) imaging offers to dramatically improve lung nodule conspicuity. The development of a high-performance DE chest imaging system is reported, with design and implementation guided by fundamental imaging performance metrics. Analytical and experimental studies of imaging performance guided the optimization of key acquisition technique parameters, including x-ray filtration, allocation of dose between low- and high-energy projections, and peak-kilovoltage selection. To minimize anatomical misregistration between images, a cardiac gating system was designed and implemented to direct x-ray exposures to within the quiescent period of the heart cycle. The instrumentation and optimal imaging techniques have been incorporated in a DE imaging prototype system now deployed in a clinical study to evaluate the diagnostic performance of DE imaging.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>tetralogy of Fallot</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common cyanotic congenital heart defect and infants with TOF incur significant right ventricular(RV) dysfunction due to perioperative injury. Insulin has been shown to reduce perioperative myocardial injury and significantly improve postoperative cardiac function. However, studies are limited&#xd;
to the adult population and the effects in a pediatric heart with a CHD are unknown.&#xd;
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical study designed to investigate insulin’s potential cardioprotective effects postoperatively and mechanisms of action during pediatric cardiac surgery. Thirty infants with TOF were equally randomly allocated to receive either standard cardioplegia (SC) or 10UI insulin-enhanced (IC). Expression profiles of surgery were generated from biopsies extracted from the right ventricular outflow tract (end ischemia and five minutes of reperfusion) and hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133A GeneChips. Gene expression profiles were generated using two softwares, ArrayAssist V2.6 (paired t-test) and affylmGUI (ANOVA). Survival rate was 100%. Compared to patients in the SC group, patients in the IC group demonstrated a trend toward a 1.8 fold decrease (p = .06) in reperfusion duration (61.93 ± 61.12 vs. 35.20 ± 23.16 hrs., respectively), a significant 2-fold decrease in the length of ICU stay (p = .04) (4.2 ± 3.9 vs. 2.3 ± 1.1 days, respectively) and a trend toward a 2.5 fold decrease in intubation duration (p= .06) (2.5± 12.2 vs. 55.0 ± 67 hrs., respectively). Patients in the IC group also demonstrated significantly lower inotropic scores, calculated at 12-hour intervals across a 48-hour ICU period, (ANOVA p = .01) and significantly greater urine volume, by 71%, (p = .02). IC evoked a cardioprotective gene expression profile aimed at mitigating perioperative myocardial injury, specifically; apoptosis, inflammation, cardiac hypertrophy, arrythmias and fibrosis. The improved postoperative outcome and cardioprotective gene expression signature with IC suggests that, administration of insulin during cardiac surgery in infants with TOF may prevent cardiac dysfunction as a result of&#xd;
mitigating perioperative myocardial injury. Overall, this exploratory study demonstrated insulin-enhanced cardioplegia to be a potential cardioprotective agent during pediatric heart surgery.</dc:description>

The drug polymer was synthesized using diisocyanates, poly(caprolactone)diols, and oxaceprol (OC) biomonomers. Biodegradation studies demonstrated that the trimethylhexamethylene diisocyanate-based drug polymer responded to an inflammatory enzyme to release more OC, while a 1, 12-diisocyanatododecane analog demonstrated minimal drug release. The drug delivery response was believed to be a direct function of the molecular structure and distribution of the hard segment.&#xd;
The second objective of this thesis was to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of OC by investigating its effects on cytokine-induced monocytic-cells adhesion&#xd;
in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. Results showed that OC had&#xd;
no direct effect on the monocyte-endothelium adhesion, suggesting that OC may mediate&#xd;
inflammation by mechanisms other than those suggested by the literature.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Constraint-based models of metabolism seldom incorporate capacity constraints on intracellular fluxes due to the lack of experimental data. This can sometimes lead to&#xd;
inaccurate growth phenotype predictions. Meanwhile, other forms of data such as fitness profiling data from growth competition experiments have been demonstrated to contain valuable information for elucidating key aspects of the underlying metabolic network. Hence, the optimal capacity constraint identification (OCCI) algorithm is developed to reconcile constraint-based models of metabolism with fitness profiling data by identifying a set of flux capacity constraints that optimally fits a wide array of strains. OCCI is able to identify capacity constraints with considerable accuracy by matching 1,155 in&#xd;
silico-generated growth rates using a simplified model of Escherichia coli central carbon metabolism. Capacity constraints identified using experimental fitness profiles with OCCI generated novel hypotheses, while integrating thermodynamics-based metabolic flux analysis allowed prediction of metabolite concentrations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Narcolepsy is a disabling sleep disorder that is characterized by persistent sleepiness, and cataplexy – an involuntary loss of waking muscle tone. Cataplexy and narcolepsy are caused by the loss of hypocretin containing neurons in the hypothalamus. However, it is hypothesized that dopamine is also involved in sleep and motor control and plays a role in cataplexy. This study investigated how manipulating dopamine affected sleep and cataplexy in narcoleptic mice devoid of hypocretin. We used d-amphetamine to increase endogenous dopamine levels and quinpirole (D2 agonist) to agonize D2 receptor sites. Amphetamine promoted wakefulness while decreasing sleep in wild-type mice, but was less effective in narcoleptic mice. Amphetamine also reduced cataplexy as well as sleep attacks (an indicator of sleepiness) in narcoleptic mice. Quinpirole had no effect on sleep or wakefulness; however, it potently increased cataplexy without affecting sleep attacks in narcoleptic mice.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Chronic hyperlipidemia (lipotoxicity) and hyperglycemia (glucotoxicity) have recently been shown to induce Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress, which may contribute to pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes. This thesis examined the involvement of ER stress in beta-cell lipotoxicity and glucotoxicity. Although chronic treatment with saturated free fatty acids (FFA) in vitro induced ER stress, altering ER stress by increasing or knocking-down GRP78 chaperone expression had no effect on apoptosis induction. Conversely, overexpression of ER chaperones rescued the reduction in proinsulin protein levels caused by chronic exposure to high glucose, although it had no effect on the decreased insulin mRNA levels and proinsulin translation rate. Thus, ER stress is likely not the main mechanism involved in saturated FFA-induced beta-cell apoptosis in vitro, but it may contribute to glucotoxic effects on proinsulin levels. These findings have increased our understanding of the link between ER stress and beta-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Pen-based computers bring the promise of tapping into people’s expressiveness with pen and paper and producing a platform that feels familiar while providing new functionalities only possible within an electronic medium. To this day, pen computers’ success is marginal because their interfaces mainly replicate keyboard and mouse ones. Maximizing the potential of pen computers requires redesigning their interfaces so that they are sensitive to the pen’s input modalities and expressiveness. In particular, pressure is an important and expressive, yet underutilized,&#xd;
pen input modality.&#xd;
This dissertation advances our knowledge about pressure-aware, pen-based interactions and how people use these techniques. We systematically explore their design by first investigating how pressure can affect pen interactions. We propose novel techniques that take advantage of the pressure modality of a pen to control, link, and annotate digital video.&#xd;
We then study people’s performance using pressure to navigate through a set of elements and find that they can discriminate a minimum of six different pressure regions. We introduce the concept of Pressure Widgets and suggest visual and interaction properties for their design.&#xd;
We later explore pressure’s use to enhance the adjustment of continuous parameters and propose Zliding, a technique in which users vary pressure to adjust the scale of the parameter space, while sliding their pen to perform parameter manipulations. We study Zliding and find it a viable technique, which is capable of enabling arbitrarily precise parameter adjustments.&#xd;
We finally present a novel interaction technique defined by the concurrent variation in pressure applied while dragging a pen. We study these pressure marks and find that they are a compact, orientation-independent, full interaction phrase that can be 30% faster than a stateof-the-art selection-action interaction phrase.&#xd;
This dissertation also makes a number of key contributions throughout the design and study&#xd;
of novel interaction techniques:&#xd;
-It identifies important design issues for the development of pressure-sensitive, pen operated widgets and interactions,&#xd;
-It provides design guidelines for interaction techniques and interface elements utilizing pressure-enabled input devices,&#xd;
-It presents empirical data on people’s ability to control pressure, and&#xd;
-It charts a visual design space of pressure-sensitive, pen-based interactions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This thesis is motivated by the use of full-depth, precast, prestressed concrete panels to facilitate deck replacement of composite bridges. The shear pockets required in using convention shear stud connections, however, can cause durability problems. The objective of this study is to investigate the possibility of eliminating the use of shear studs, and adhesively bond the concrete and steel sections.&#xd;
&#xd;
The feasibility of the developed polyurethane adhesive joint is defined based on the serviceability and ultimate limit states. The joint must have sufficient stiffness that additional deflection due to slip must not be excessive. The adhesive and bond must also have sufficient strength to allow the development of the full plastic capacity of the composite section. The use of the developed adhesive joint in typical composite bridges was found to be feasible. The behaviour under live load was found to be close to a fully composite section.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Objectives:  To determine the level of adoption and which characteristics are most strongly associated with the adoption of a clinical innovation in Mental Health and Addiction Service organizations in Ontario, one year after dissemination.  &#xd;
Methods: This cross-sectional study included a voluntary quantitative mail-out survey, using a self administered questionnaire that was sent to 260 mental health and addiction service organizations in Ontario. Linear regression analysis was conducted to identify significant predictors of the overall adoption-decision of the best practice recommendations.&#xd;
Results:  Individuals’ tenure within the organization and the provision of screening (organizational variable) was identified to be predictors of adoption for the organization. &#xd;
Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrated the majority of the organizations are on the path towards a finale decision of adopting or rejecting the recommendations. The results also demonstrate the importance of individual characteristics and organizational characteristics in identifying predictors of adoption.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The challenges faced by the Brazilian forest industry dealing with the natural forests and plantations have provided favourable ground for the establishment of forest certification. This study presents the first investigation of the two certification systems (FSC and Cerflor) in Brazil from the private sector perspective. Through an exploratory factor analysis (EFA), market, learning, and signaling were validated as governance mechanisms of forest certification in Brazil. The results from the importance and performance analysis (IPA) indicated that companies did not see any return in terms of a better price for certified products; however, they demonstrated high satisfaction with the performances of non-economic benefits. Descriptive statistics revealed external pressures influencing companies to pursue forest certification and overall accomplishments of certification from economic, social and ecological points of view. Finally, suggestions for future research and conclusions are made in order to provide information for the industry, certification systems, and the Brazilian government.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The objective of this thesis was to assess the diversity and community structure of fungi in a forest plot in Ontario using a variety of field sampling and analytical methods.  Three broad questions were addressed: 1) How do different measures affect the resulting view of fungal diversity?  2) Do fruiting bodies and soil rDNA sampling detect the same phylogenetic and ecological groups of Agaricomycotina?  3) Will additional rDNA sampling resolve the phylogenetic position of unclassified fungal sequences recovered from environmental sampling?  Generally, richness, abundance, and phylogenetic diversity (PD) correspond and identify the same dominant fungal groups in the study site, although in different proportions.  Clades with longer branch lengths tend to comprise a larger proportion of diversity when assessed using PD.  Three phylogenetic-based comparisons were found to be variable in their ability to detect significant differences.  Generally, the Unifrac significance measure (Lozupone et al., 2006) is the most conservative, followed by the P-test (Martin, 2002), and Libshuff library comparison (Singleton et al., 2001) with our dataset.  Fruiting body collections and rDNA sampling recover largely different assemblages of fungi at the species level; however, both methods identify the same taxonomic groups at the genus-order level as well as ectomycorrhizal fungi as the dominant functional type of Agaricomycotina.  This work also shows that the Soil Clone Group I (SCGI) clade is widespread in soils of diverse origins and represents a novel subphylum of Ascomycota.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In the past little work has been done to characterize the models of various mereotopological systems. This thesis focuses on Asher and Vieu's first-order mereotopology which evolved from Clarke's Calculus of Individuals. Its soundness and completeness proofs with respect to a topological translation of the axioms provide only sparse insights into structural properties of the mereotopological models. To overcome this problem, we characterize these models with respect to mathematical&#xd;
structures with well-defined properties - topological spaces, lattices, and graphs.&#xd;
We prove that the models of the subtheory RT− are isomorphic to p-ortholattices&#xd;
(pseudocomplemented, orthocomplemented). Combining the advantages of lattices&#xd;
and graphs, we show how Cartesian products of finite p-ortholattices with one multiplicand being not uniquely complemented (unicomplemented) gives finite models of the full mereotopology. Our analysis enables a comparison to other mereotopologies, in particular to the RCC, of which lattice-theoretic characterizations exist.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Web accessibility guidelines have textual representation and provide little support in systematic analysis and usage. The study hypothesizes that the guidelines can be reorganized and represented using the goal oriented technique and design patterns which will allow their usage in a more systematic manner and accommodate detailed analysis of the guidelines with other competing goals. For this study, knowledge from web designers’ experiences in using the guidelines, researchers’ findings, and the actual guidelines have been amalgamated. Six web designers have been consulted on a one-on-one basis and difficulties in using the guidelines for (1) specific scenarios, (2) systematic application, and (3) detailed systems analysis have been reported. Goal oriented modeling and design patterns have been introduced for (1) graphical representation of the guidelines using goal graphs, and (2) keeping the technical details separate from the goal graphs. The proposed representation allows for the accessibility guidelines to be systematically applied into interface design, and systems design using the goal oriented modeling technique.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This study identifies potential changes within the current tenure system to better accommodate Aboriginal values.  Aboriginal expectations for sustainable forest management were identified using structured conceptual content cognitive mapping. A structured survey of industry, government and First Nations participants was then used to identify Aboriginal expectations that are poorly met through the current tenure system and establish which attributes of tenure could be modified in order to meet these expectations.  Perception gaps existed between the Kaska and government/industry about the ability of current forest management institutions to meet Aboriginal expectations. Some of the expectations were met in part by tenure but when tenure failed or couldn’t meet expectations, other institutions were often in place to meet them. However, some expectations could neither be met through institutions nor modifications to existing tenures and so recommendations were made for the creation of an Aboriginal tenure as a means of addressing these issues.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Metal organic framework (MOF) has emerged as a new class of porous, thermally stable material which has attracted great attention due to their wide applications in gas storage, separation, catalysis etc. Self-assembly is the operative mechanism of MOFs syntheses; however, the control of MOF self-assembly is still a challenge in the construction of predetermined, structurally well-defined MOFs. The goal of the research is to arrive at multidimensional, highly porous and functional MOFs via hierarchical assembly of smaller molecular building blocks and, at the same time, to examine the possibilities for different interesting molecular textures. This goal is to be accomplished by the knowledge of ligand coordination mode, and geometry as well as logical choices of ligands and metals from which the MOFs are to be constructed from. Preparations of novel frameworks as well as other interesting molecular architectures are highlighted with their structures characterized.</dc:description>

ABSTRACT&#xd;
Attentional cueing modulated neural processes differently depending on input modality. I used event-related fMRI to investigate how auditory and visual cues affected reaction times to auditory and visual targets. Behavioural results showed that responses were faster when: cues appeared first compared to targets and cues were auditory versus visual. The first result was supported by an increase in BOLD percent signal change in sensory cortices upon cue but not target presentation. Task-related activation patterns showed that the auditory cue activated auditory and visual cortices while the visual cue activated the visual cortices and the fronto-polar cortex. Next, I computed brain-behaviour correlations for both cue types which revealed that the auditory cue recruited medial visual areas and a fronto-parietal attentional network to mediate behaviour while the visual cue engaged a posterior network composed of lateral visual areas and subcortical structures. The results suggest that crossmodal facilitation occurs via independent neural pathways depending on cue modality.</dc:description>

Abstract&#xd;
&#xd;
Purpose: To examine the oral health status of psychiatric in-patients at two long-term psychiatric health centres, with one operating a full-time dental care facility. &#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: Data were gathered from clinical examinations, a structured interview and hospital records from 120 participants. Periodontal (CPI) and dental (DMFT) indices, subjectively reported oral health status, and oral health behaviour were subsequently analyzed. &#xd;
&#xd;
Results: Referrals for dental problems were made for 62.9% of participants. Bivariate analyses revealed positive correlations between DMFT scores, age and length of stay. Multiple regression analyses demonstrated correlations between DMFT scores and infrequent dental visits, frequent snacking and age. Patients at the psychiatric hospital without a full-time dental care facility were more likely to have had higher DMFT scores, and infrequent dental visits.&#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions: Psychiatric patients have poor oral health and significant oral health treatment needs. This study underlines the need for on-site dental care facilities at long-term psychiatric care centres.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Robust speech recognition in acoustic environments that contain multiple speech sources and/or complex non-stationary noise is a difficult problem, but one of great practical interest. The formalism of probabilistic graphical models constitutes a relatively new and very powerful tool for better understanding and extending existing&#xd;
models, learning, and inference algorithms; and a bedrock for the creative, quasi-systematic development of new ones. In this thesis a collection of new graphical models and inference algorithms for robust speech recognition are presented.&#xd;
The problem of speech separation using multiple microphones is first treated. A family of variational algorithms for tractably combining multiple acoustic models of speech with observed sensor likelihoods is presented. The algorithms recover high quality estimates of the speech sources even when there are more sources than microphones, and have improved upon the state-of-the-art in terms of SNR gain by over 10 dB.&#xd;
Next the problem of background compensation in non-stationary acoustic environments is treated. A new dynamic noise adaptation (DNA) algorithm for robust noise compensation is presented, and shown to outperform several existing state-of-the-art&#xd;
front-end denoising systems on the new DNA + Aurora II and Aurora II-M extensions of the Aurora II task. &#xd;
Finally, the problem of speech recognition in speech using a single microphone is treated. The Iroquois system for multi-talker speech separation and recognition&#xd;
is presented. The system won the 2006 Pascal International Speech Separation Challenge,  and amazingly, achieved super-human recognition performance on a majority of test cases in the task. The result marks a significant first in automatic speech recognition, and a milestone in computing.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A parallel implicit adaptive-mesh-refinement scheme is proposed for the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations as applied to two-dimensional steady-state hypersonic laminar flows in conjunction with an equilibrium high-temperature equation of state. A finite-volume discretization is applied to the governing equations. Limited piecewise-linear solution reconstruction and Riemann solvers (Roe and HLLE, both modified for a general equation of state) are used to evaluate the inviscid fluxes. The gradients in the viscous fluxes are calculated using diamond-path reconstruction. The system of non-linear algebraic equations resulting from the finite-volume discretization are solved using an inexact Newton method with GMRES to solve the update step of the Newton method. GMRES is preconditioned with Schwarz preconditioning with local block-fill incomplete lower-upper factorization. Multigrid and pseudo-transient continuation are used for startup. Numerical results, including flows at Mach numbers of 7.0, are discussed and demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the scheme.</dc:description>

<dc:subject>8-Hydroxyquinoline Metal</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Because of its potential application for flat panel displays, solid-state lighting and 1.5 µm emitter for fiber optical communications, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been intensively researched. One of the major problems with current OLED technology relates to inefficient electron injection at the cathode interface, which causes high driving voltage and poor device stability. Making a low resistance cathode contact for electron injection is critical to device performance. This work mainly focuses on cathode interface design and engineering. &#xd;
The Ohmic contact using a structure of C60/LiF/Al has been developed in electron only devices. It is found that application of the C60/LiF/Al contact to Alq based OLEDs leads to a dramatic reduction in driving voltages, a significant improvement in power efficiency, and a much slower aging process.&#xd;
A new cathode structure based on metal-organic-metal (MOM) tri-layer films has been developed. It is found that MOM cathodes reduce reflection by deconstructive optical interference from two metal films. The absolute reflectance from the MOM tri-layer films can be reduced to as low as 7% in the visible light spectrum. In actual working devices, the reflectance can be reduced from ~80% to ~ 20%. MOM cathodes provide a potential low-cost solution for high contrast full-color OLED displays.&#xd;
Low voltage Erq based OLEDs at 1.5 µm emission have been developed. The Erq/Ag cathode interface has been found to be efficient for electron injection. Dramatic improvement in driving voltage and power efficiency has been realized by implementing Bphen and C60 into Erq devices as an electron transport layer. Integration of Erq devices on Si wafers has also been demonstrated.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This dissertation investigates how the Greeks of the Trojan War and Alexander the Great are presented in Old French and Middle English literature.  These ancient Greeks are depicted ambiguously: they share some of the characteristics of Jews and Saracens as they are portrayed in medieval literature.  The thesis begins with an overview of the frameworks used to define ancient Greek identity.  These include the philosophical heritage Greece left to the medieval West; the framework of Jewish identity, encompassing “variable characterization” and the hermeneutics of supersession; and the historical template, seen through the Orosian paradigm of translatio imperii and the Trojan foundation myth.&#xd;
The first chapter examines the Roman de Troie of Benoît de Sainte-Maure.  The Greeks of the Trojan War are noble and valorous, but through their gift of the Trojan horse and sack of Troy, they display the treachery associated with post-Incarnation Jews and the cruelty and violence associated with Saracens.  Due to the myth that the Trojans founded the Roman people, through their siege of Troy, the Greeks seem like the movers of imperium, the authority to rule, from Troy to Rome, which will eventually become a Christian empire.&#xd;
In the second chapter, I turn to the depiction of Alexander in Thomas of Kent’s Roman de toute chevalerie and the Middle English Wars of Alexander.  In the Roman de toute chevalerie, Alexander is ambiguous: he is chivalrous, learned, and even a proto-Christian, though he himself assumes some typical Saracen characteristics.  Alexander participates in translatio imperii, holding the right to rule in its Orosian succession and providing a model of empire to Rome.  The Wars of Alexander witnesses the changes wrought to Alexander’s depiction in the fourteenth century due to revised views of chivalry, eschatology and crusade. &#xd;
The third chapter investigates the depiction of the Greek Diomede in Chaucer’s Troilus and Criseyde, a depiction informed by classical ideas and Chaucer’s depictions of Jews and Saracens in his other works.  Diomede is both treacherous and cruel, seen in his seduction of Criseyde, rather than in battle.  The ending of the tale posits a proto-Christian identity for Troilus and the Trojans, and suggests that Diomede participates in the supersession of the Greeks by the Trojans.  Greeks function as movers of imperium, and are necessary for the beginnings of Christian empire.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Labour Supply of Unpaid Caregivers in Canada, Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), Meredith Lenore Lilly, Department of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, 2008.&#xd;
&#xd;
As medical care increasingly shifts from the hospital to the home, responsibility for care has also shifted from the state and paid care, to the family and unpaid care.  Unpaid caregivers are family members and friends who provide homecare services to recipients in their place of residence without financial compensation, as a result of their close personal relationships.  This research tests the multiple hypotheses that unpaid caregiving has an impact on (1) the probability of labour force participation (LFP); (2) hours of labour force work; and (3) earnings by caregivers in Canada.&#xd;
	We analyzed the 1996 and 2002 General Social Surveys, applying multivariate probit, logistic, and OLS regression analyses to four equations: 1) the probability of labour force participation; 2) the hourly wage; 3) weekly hours of labour market work; and 4) the probability of being an unpaid caregiver. &#xd;
Results indicate that unpaid caregiving was negatively associated with labour force participation; however, the impact on hours of labour market work and wages was uncertain.  Women and men caregivers were impacted differently: only caregiving men in 1996 had significantly lower wages than non-caregivers, and only women in 1996 worked significantly fewer hours in the labour market. When caregiving was defined broadly, only men in 1996 were significantly less likely to be employed than non-caregivers.  Yet when we controlled for caregiving intensity in 2002, both male and female primary caregivers were much less likely to be in the labour force than non-caregivers, while secondary caregivers were no less likely to be employed than non-caregivers. &#xd;
	We conclude that when caregiving responsibilities are relatively small, individuals seem able to balance both caregiving with employment.  Yet when caregiving commitments become heavy, it becomes increasingly difficult to balance employment with caregiving.  We make a number of policy recommendations ranging from improving caregiver access to financial supports, formal care and respite services, particularly for primary caregivers.  We also encourage the development of workplace legislation and caregiver friendly workplaces for the majority of caregivers who remain in the labour market.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Eukaryotic DNA-binding proteins mediate many important steps in embryonic development and gene regulation. Consequently, a better understanding of these proteins would hopefully allow a more complete picture of gene regulation to be determined. In this study, a structure-based subfamily classification of the homeodomain family of DNA-binding proteins was undertaken in order to determine whether sub-groupings of a protein family could be identified that corresponded to differences in specific function, and identification of subfamily-determining residues was performed in order to gain some insight on functional differences via analysis of the residue properties. Subfamilies appear to have different specific DNA binding properties, according to DNA profiles obtained from TRANSFAC [1] and other sources in the literature. Subfamily-specific residues appear to be frequently associated with the protein-DNA interface and may influence DNA binding via interactions with the DNA phosphate backbone; these residues form a conserved profile uniquely identifying each subfamily.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A primary purpose of elasticity imaging, commonly known as elastography, is to extract the viscoelastic properties of a medium (including soft tissue) from the displacement caused by a stress field. Dynamic elastography methods that use the acoustic radiation force of ultrasound have several advantages, such as, non-invasiveness, low cost, and ability to produce a highly localized force field. &#xd;
A method for remotely generating localized low frequency shear waves in soft tissue is investigated, by using the modulated radiation force resulting from two intersecting quasi-CW confocal ultrasound beams of slightly different frequencies. In contrast to most radiation force-based methods previously presented, such shear waves are narrowband rather than broadband. As they propagate within a viscoelastic medium, different frequency-dependent effects will not significantly affect their spectrum, thereby providing a means for measuring the shear attenuation and speed as a function of frequency. Furthermore, to improve the detection signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), increased acoustic pressure conditions may be needed, causing higher harmonics to be generated due to nonlinear propagation effects. Shear-wave propagation at harmonic modulation frequencies does not appear to have been previously discussed in the elastography literature.&#xd;
The properties of the narrowband shear wave propagation in soft tissue are studied by using the Voigt viscoelastic model and Green’s functions. In particular, the manner in which the characteristics of the viscoelastic medium affect their evolution under both low-amplitude (linear) and high-amplitude (nonlinear) source excitation and conditions that conform to human safety standards. It is shown that an exact solution of the viscoelastic Green’s function is needed to properly represent the propagation in higher-viscosity media, such as soft tissue, at frequencies much beyond a few hundred hertz. Methods for estimating the shear modulus and viscosity in viscoelastic media are developed based on both the fundamental and harmonic shear components.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This thesis researches techniques for modelling static facial expressions, as well as the dynamics of continuous&#xd;
facial motion. We demonstrate how static and dynamic properties of facial expressions can be represented within a linear &#xd;
and nonlinear context, respectively. These two representations do not act in isolation, but are mutually reinforcing in&#xd;
conceding a cohesive framework for the analysis, animation, and manipulation of expressive faces. We derive a basis for&#xd;
the linear space of expressions through Principal Components Analysis (PCA). We introduce and formalize the notion&#xd;
of "expression manifolds", manifolds residing in PCA space that model motion dynamics for semantically similar expressions.&#xd;
We then integrate these manifolds into an animation workflow by performing Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction (NLDR) on the&#xd;
expression manifolds. This operation yields expression maps that encode a wealth of information relating &#xd;
to complex facial dynamics, in a low dimensional space that is intuitive to navigate and efficient to manage.</dc:description>

ABSTRACT&#xd;
This study explored the concerns, desires (goals) and expectations of adolescents undergoing surgery for idiopathic scoliosis, and contrasted their priorities with those of their parents and surgeons. Parents were more concerned than their children about the consequences of scoliosis and of surgery. With the exception of improving physical appearance, surgeons' goals of surgery were different from those of either the patients or parents.  There was little agreement among surgeons about the natural history of scoliosis, other goals of surgery and the likelihood of specific outcomes.  Parents wanted and expected more from surgery than their children.  Parents and patients had greater expectations of surgery than surgeons.  Although adolescents had different priorities from their parents, parents were aware of these differences and reliably predicted their children’s priorities. These findings have important implications on shared decision-making and informed consent, and might contribute to better understanding and measurement of outcomes that matter to patients.</dc:description>

<dc:description>When seen through a stereoscope, a Gabor pattern (a Gaussian enveloped sinusoid) that is masked by visual noise is more readily detectable when it appears in front of or behind the noise than when it is embedded in the noise itself. The enhanced visibility brought about by stereo cues is referred to as binocular unmasking. In this work, we investigated whether binocular unmasking may also occur with visual objects more complex than simple Gabor patterns, and with tasks more demanding than detection. Specifically, we examined the effects of binocular unmasking in the detection, categorization, and identification of noise masked images of natural objects. We observed the occurrence of binocular unmasking in all three tasks. However, the size of this effect was greater for detection performance than for categorization or identification performance; the latter two benefited to the same extent by the availability of stereoscopic cues. &#xd;
We argue that these results suggest that low level stereoscopic depth cues may play a helpful role, not only in simple detection tasks with psychophysical stimuli, but also in the perception of complex stimuli depicting natural objects.</dc:description>

<dc:description>This research extends the knowledge-based view of the firm as it relates to organizational structure.  In particular, this research provides evidence that fundamental classifications of knowledge are measurable, in relative terms, as factors of production. It then relates differences in relative quantities of these classifications of knowledge to the presence or absence of inter-firm boundaries. Finally, this study provides evidence that financial performance may be related to the alignment of organizational structure with knowledge-based factors of production.&#xd;
This study contributes to strategic management theory by offering a potential solution to the difficulties of measuring knowledge as a factor of production. The research was motivated by the belief that it is the cost and value of knowledge that determines economic efficiency (Simon, 1999).  By surveying professionals in the mutual fund industry for their relative reliance on three classifications of knowledge, this study suggests a set of measures of knowledge-based factors of production. These measures in turn support the testing of hypotheses related to the vertical integration (or de-integration) of adjacent stages of production.&#xd;
Researchers have typically categorized organizational knowledge as either tacit or explicit. This research develops the concept of encapsulated knowledge as a fundamental classification of knowledge. Encapsulated knowledge is neither tacit nor explicit, because it is externalized and implicit. Progress in measuring knowledge is made by distinguishing between knowledge that resides in human minds (tacit), knowledge that is codified as information (codified), and knowledge that is embodied in the design and functionality of physical artefacts (encapsulated).&#xd;
Relative reliance on the fundamentally different knowledge-based factors of production was found to vary between adjacent stages of production, despite the essential overlap of jointly held substantive knowledge. Portfolio managers are generally less (more) reliant on tacit (encapsulated) knowledge than other investment management professionals in the mutual fund complex. In addition, portfolio managers whose firms are de-integrated from the mutual fund management firms were found to be more (less) reliant on tacit (encapsulated) knowledge than their integrated counterparts. Finally, alignment between mutual fund structure and reliance on knowledge-based factors of production was found to affect performance of mutual funds.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Semantic distance is a measure of how close or distant in meaning two units of language are. A large number of important natural language problems, including machine&#xd;
translation and word sense disambiguation,&#xd;
can be viewed as semantic distance problems.&#xd;
The two dominant approaches to estimating semantic distance are the WordNet-based semantic measures and the corpus-based distributional measures.  In this thesis, I compare them, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and identify the limitations of each.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis argues that estimating semantic distance is essentially a property of&#xd;
concepts (rather than words) and that&#xd;
two concepts are semantically close if they occur in similar contexts.&#xd;
Instead of identifying the co-occurrence (distributional) profiles of words (distributional hypothesis), I argue that distributional profiles of concepts (DPCs) can be used to infer the semantic properties of concepts and indeed to estimate semantic distance more accurately. I propose a new hybrid approach to calculating semantic distance that combines corpus statistics and a published thesaurus (Macquarie Thesaurus).&#xd;
The algorithm determines estimates of the DPCs using the categories in the thesaurus as very coarse concepts and, notably, without requiring any sense-annotated data. Even though the use of only about 1000 concepts to represent the vocabulary of a language seems drastic, I show that the method achieves results better than the state-of-the-art in a number of natural language tasks.&#xd;
&#xd;
I show how cross-lingual DPCs can be created by combining text in one language with a thesaurus from another. Using these cross-lingual DPCs, we can solve problems&#xd;
in one, possibly resource-poor, language using a knowledge source from another,&#xd;
possibly resource-rich, language. I show that the approach is also useful in tasks that inherently involve two or more languages, such as machine translation and multilingual text summarization.&#xd;
&#xd;
The proposed approach is computationally inexpensive, it can estimate both semantic&#xd;
relatedness and semantic similarity, and it can be applied to all parts of speech.&#xd;
Extensive experiments on ranking word pairs as per semantic distance, real-word spelling correction, solving Reader's Digest word choice problems, determining word sense dominance, word sense disambiguation, and&#xd;
word translation show that the new approach is markedly superior to previous ones.</dc:description>
