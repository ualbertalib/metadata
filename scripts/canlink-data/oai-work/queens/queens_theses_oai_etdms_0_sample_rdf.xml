      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis describes and develops two experimental techniques, Time Resolved Photoelectron Spectroscopy (TRPES), and Time Resolved Coincidence Imaging Spectroscopy
                  (TRCIS), to study ultrafast gas phase chemical dynamics. We use TRPES to investigate the effects of methyl substitution on the electronic dynamics of the simple alpha, beta-enones
                  acrolein, crotonaldehyde, methylvinylketone, and methacrolein following excitation to the S2 state. We determine that following excitation, the molecules move rapidly away from the
                  Franck-Condon region reaching a conical intersection promoting relaxation to the S1 state. Once on the S1 surface, the trajectories access another conical intersection leading them
                  to the ground state. Only small variations between molecules are seen in their S2 decay times. However, the position of methyl group substitution greatly affects the relaxation rate
                  from the S1 surface. Ab initio calculations used to compare the geometries, energies, and topographies of the S1/S0 conical intersections of the molecules are not able to explain the
                  variations in relaxation behaviour. We propose a model that uses dynamical factors of specific motions in the molecules to explain the differing nonadiabatic S1/S0 crossing
                  rates.&#xD; &#xD; The second part of this thesis examines the issues involved with design and construction of a Coincidence Imaging Spectrometer. This type of spectrometer measures
                  the 3-dimensional velocities of both photoelectrons and photoions generated from probing of laser induced photodissociation reactions. Importantly, the photoelectrons and photoions
                  are measured in coincidence from single molecules, enabling measurements such as recoil frame photoelectron angular distributions and correlated photoelectron/photoion energy maps,
                  inaccessible using existing techniques. How to optimize the spectrometer resolution through design, tuning, and calibration is discussed. The power of TRCIS is demonstrated with the
                  investigation of the photodissociation dynamics of the NO dimer. TRPES experiments first identified a sequential kinetic model following 209nm excitation resulting in NO(X) (ground
                  state) and NO(A) (excited state) products. Using TRCIS, it was possible to measure time resolved vibrational energy distributions of the products, indicating the extent of
                  vibrational energy redistribution within the dimers prior to dissociation. Recoil frame photoelectron angular distributions and theoretical support allow identification of a
                  previously disputed intermediate on the dissociation pathway.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In this study, the feasibility of utilizing the spin casting technique with structural Fibre-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) tubes and eliminating steel reinforcement is explored
                  for the first time. This would make spun-cast FRP tubes (SCFTs) desirable in pole applications, as they are relatively light-weight, protected from deicing salts and other elements
                  by the tube, and have similar flexural resistance to the completely filled FRP tubes (CFFTs). This study evaluates the flexural and bond performances of SCFTs through experimental
                  and analytical investigations. The experimental investigation included a total of nine beam specimens, approximately 330 mm in diameter and 2.85 m in length, tested in three and
                  four-point bending. Glass-FRP (GFRP) tubes with different wall thicknesses and proportions of fibres in the longitudinal and hoop directions were used in eight specimens. One control
                  specimen was cut from a conventional prestressed spun-cast pole and tested for comparison. Also, one specimen was essentially a control CFFT. The main parameters studied were tube
                  laminate structure, concrete wall thickness, and the effect of additional steel rebar in SCFTs. The experimental investigation also included six push-off stub specimens tested to
                  examine the bond behaviour of SCFTs. An analytical model predicting the flexural response of SCFT beams was developed, verified, and used in a parametric study to examine a wider
                  range of tube laminate structures, concrete wall thicknesses and FRP tube thicknesses. The study demonstrated the feasibility of fabrication of SCFTs in conventional precast plants.
                  SCFTs were shown to have similar flexural strength to conventional prestressed spun-cast poles of an equivalent reinforcement index but are less stiff due to the lower modulus of FRP
                  and lack of prestressing. SCFTs with inner-to-outer diameter ratio (Di/Do) up to about 0.6 achieved the same flexural strength as the CFFT specimen. However, the parametric study
                  showed that this optimum (Di/Do) ratio is dependent on tube thickness and laminate structure and is generally smaller in thicker tubes or tubes stiffer in the longitudinal
                  direction.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Blasts and impacts are two of the severest loads a structure can experience. Blast experimenters, however, have observed that the load imparted to a circular member was
                  lower than the predicted design load. Additionally, numerous investigations have established the superiority of concrete filled FRP tubes (CFFTs) over conventional reinforced
                  concrete members. These observations indicated CFFTs’ potential to resist dynamic blast and impact loads. The experimental and numerical investigations presented in this thesis aimed
                  to demonstrate the suitability of CFFTs to resist blast and impact loads, to determine the parameters that influence their behaviour under such loads, and to develop a design
                  procedure for resisting these loads. The initial numerical investigation determined the reflected blast loading parameters experienced by a circular cross section. The experimental
                  phase consisted of testing twelve full scale specimens, two monotonically, four under impact loading, and six under close-in blast loading. The monotonically tested specimens acted
                  as controls for the entire program. The results of the impact testing investigation were used to develop and validate a non-linear single degree of freedom (SDOF) model. This impact
                  phase also led to the development of relatively simple procedures for designing CFFTs under impact loading using either SDOF modeling or the conservation of energy. Analysis of the
                  blast testing results led to the development of numerical procedures for obtaining an equivalent close-in blast loading for SDOF analysis of CFFTs and Pressure-Impulse diagrams. The
                  use of SDOF modeling and conservation of energy in blast design were also discussed. Finally, a non-linear explicit dynamic model of CFFTs was developed using the commercial software
                  ANSYS Autodyn. This model was verified using the experimental impact and blast test results and used to conduct a parametric study. The results of these investigations indicated that
                  CFFTs were particularly suitable for blast and impact resistant applications, as their geometry diffracted blast waves and the addition of the tube increased their energy absorbing
                  capacity significantly giving them additional strength and ductility. The tube also confined and protected the concrete core and simplified construction.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>For pathogenic microorganisms, heme uptake and degradation is a critical mechanism for iron acquisition that enables multiplication and survival within hosts they invade.
                  While the bacterial proteins involved in heme transport had been identified at the initiation of our investigation, the fate of heme once it reached the cytoplasm was largely
                  uncharacterized. Here we report the first crystal structures of two members of the heme utilization operon from the human pathogen Escherichia coli O157:H7. These are the heme
                  oxygenase ChuS in its apo and heme-complexed forms, and the apo form of heme binding protein ChuX. Surprisingly, despite minimal sequence similarity between the N- and C-terminal
                  halves, the structure of ChuS is a structural repeat. Furthermore, the ChuS monomer forms a topology that is similar to the homodimeric structure of ChuX. Based on spectral analysis
                  and carbon monoxide measurement by gas chromatography, we demonstrated that ChuS is a heme oxygenase, the first to be identified in any E. coli strain. We also show that ChuS
                  coordinates heme in a unique fashion relative to other heme oxygenases, potentially contributing to its enhanced activity. As ChuS and ChuX share structural homology, we extended the
                  structural insight gained in our analysis of ChuS to purport a hypothesis of heme binding for ChuX. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ChuX may serve to modulate cytoplasmic stores of
                  heme by binding heme and transferring it to other hemoproteins such as ChuS. Based on sequence and structural comparisons, we designed a number of site-directed mutations in ChuS and
                  ChuX to probe heme binding sites and mechanisms in each. ChuS and ChuX mutants were analyzed through reconstitution experiments with heme and functional analyses, including enzyme
                  catalysis by ChuS and mutants, and in culture development during heme challenge experiments by ChuX and mutants. Taken together, our results suggested that ChuX acts upstream of
                  ChuS, and regulates heme uptake through ChuX-mediated heme binding and release. ChuS can degrade heme as a potential iron source or antioxidant, thereby contributing directly to E.
                  coli O157:H7 pathogenesis. Functional implications that may be revealed from sequence and structure based information will be addressed as they pertained to our evaluation of ChuS
                  and ChuX. -- Fish heads, fish heads, rolly polly fish heads.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Every species has a limit to its geographic distribution. The problem is that we don’t really know why. Classical explanations propose that range limits occur where the
                  ecological conditions overwhelm adaptation and populations are no longer self-sustaining. It is generally expected that population abundance and fitness decline towards range margins
                  across a gradient of declining habitat quality. Current evolutionary and theoretical explanations of range limits predict that this geographic pattern of demography will result in
                  genetic constraints in marginal populations, such that range expansion is thwarted by reduced evolutionary potential. In this thesis, I tested the key assumptions and predictions of
                  range limit theory through an empirical evaluation of two coastal dune, endemic plants; Camissonia cheiranthifolia (Spreng.) Raim. (Onagraceae) and Abronia umbellata L.
                  (Nyctaginaceae). In geographic wide surveys of a large proportion of populations across both species’ ranges, neither species exhibited declining abundance or performance towards its
                  range limits. Central populations of C. cheiranthifolia tended to have a higher production of seeds per unit area than marginal populations. Although this pattern demonstrated the
                  potential for gene flow from central sites to swamp selection in marginal sites, results from a transplant experiment suggested that this was unlikely. Experimental populations of C.
                  cheiranthifolia originating from ≥ 675 km south of the northern range limit exhibited similar levels of fitness when planted at the range margin. Along a 200 km transect across the
                  limit, and in contrast to expectations, fitness of all populations increased towards the limit and generally remained high beyond the limit. Individuals from all populations
                  reproduced and matured fruit beyond the limit, suggesting that if individuals dispersed beyond the limit that populations would establish. The species’ abrupt distributional limit
                  also did not correspond to an abrupt shift in ecological conditions, despite the association of fitness with plant community and microhabitat variables. Overall, ecological
                  tolerances to fitness or niche-based explanations to range limits do not adequately describe the distributions of either species. Constraints on dispersal rate, the influence of
                  anthropogenic factors on habitat dispersion and limited genetic variability for fitness related traits are addressed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The increasing prevalence of abdominal obesity worldwide poses a serious public health problem and hence, presents a target for research designed to improve the assessment
                  or treatment of abdominal obesity. Specifically, the first study in this thesis investigated the influence of age and gender on visceral (VAT) and abdominal subcutaneous adipose
                  tissue (ASAT) for a given waist circumference (WC) in 481 men and women varying widely in age and BMI. Significant gender differences in VAT and ASAT for a given WC were observed,
                  however, only the relationship between WC and VAT was substantially influenced by age. &#xD; The second study examined whether the associations between VAT, ASAT and the metabolic
                  syndrome (MetS) were altered depending on measurement methodology used to assess VAT and ASAT. The odds ratio (OR) for MetS was higher for total VAT volume (OR=7.26) and the partial
                  volumes at T12-L1 (OR=7.46) and L1-L2 (OR=8.77) compared to the classic L4-L5 (OR=3.94) measurement. The OR for MetS was not substantially different among the ASAT measures (OR~2.6).
                  Measurement site for VAT, but not ASAT, has a substantial influence on the magnitude of the association with MetS.&#xD; The third study examined the independent associations between
                  VAT, ASAT, liver fat and all-cause mortality in 291 men (97 decedents and 194 controls, mortality follow-up of 2.2±1.3 years). In a model including VAT, ASAT, liver fat, age, and
                  length of follow-up, only VAT (1.93 [1.15-3.23]) remained a significant predictor of mortality. We concluded that VAT is a strong, independent predictor of all-cause mortality in
                  men. &#xD; The purpose of the final study was to determine the effect of aerobic exercise dose (energy expenditure) on WC in sedentary, overweight/obese postmenopausal women (n=424).
                  The women were randomly assigned to a control group or one of three aerobic exercise groups that exercised at energy expenditures of 4-, 8-, or 12-kcal/kg body weight/week. By
                  comparison to control, there were significant reductions in WC in the exercise groups (~3 cm, P &lt;0.05), which were independent of weight loss. However, the amount of exercise
                  performed was not associated with reductions in WC in a dose dependent manner.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Governments use the Internet as another means to offer services to the public. One such service is to deliver GIS over the Internet, also known as webGIS. While some
                  Ontario municipalities provide webGIS services, its level of deployment across Ontario is unknown. Further, the mechanisms behind implementation and its effects on public engagement
                  in planning issues are uncertain. This thesis attempts to answer some of these questions. &#xD; All known Ontario municipal websites were surveyed to determine the level of webGIS
                  provision. These webGIS were then benchmarked using a set of criteria from four categories (Accessibility, Data Availability, Functionality, Presentation/Utilities). A secondary set
                  of criteria was also used to analyze related areas about webGIS provision. Interviews were conducted with nine municipal officials about the development and implementation of their
                  municipality’s webGIS. Issues discussed include rationales, funding, implementation, webGIS technology, data issues, positive effects, obstacles to development, and user
                  effects.&#xD; Of the 445 Ontario municipalities, 41 offered webGIS services to their community. The municipal webGIS showed a wide range of services from basic visualization to more

      <dcterms:abstract>Arsenic taken up by plants and fungi from contaminated soils can subsequently be introduced into food chains. Given the toxic properties of some arsenic compounds, this may
                  be a cause for concern. Much remains to be learned about how these compounds are transformed and distributed in terrestrial organisms. Radishes, white button mushrooms, fur, and
                  feather samples were thus investigated to gain a better understanding of arsenic biotransformations in terrestrial organisms. &#xD; In this study, we utilized two analytical
                  techniques for the detection and identification of arsenic compounds (“arsenic speciation analysis”). High performance liquid chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass
                  spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS) provided a highly sensitive method for detecting low levels (ng•g-1) of methanol:water extractable arsenic compounds. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)
                  techniques provided direct arsenic speciation analysis of tissues, resulting in a more representative arsenic profile of the original organisms, without the need to extract arsenic
                  first. Overall, the results for speciation analysis underline the complementary nature of the HPLC-ICP-MS and XAS techniques. &#xD; Mushrooms contained organic arsenic compounds
                  which were not identified in the radish. In particular arsenobetaine (AB), which is usually found as a minor constituent of terrestrial organisms, was a predominant arsenic compound
                  found in mushroom extracts. How AB is synthesized in the environment remains unclear; however, results presented here suggest it was a product of fungal biotransformation and we
                  speculate it may play a role in osmoregulation. In radish, fur and feather samples, direct analysis identified arsenic(III)-sulphur compounds not observed using HPLC-ICP-MS. In
                  plants, these compounds are likely to be metal/metalloid binding phytochelatin proteins the formation of which has yet to be confirmed in planta. In radish plant vasculature, XAS
                  imaging revealed segregation of pentavalent and trivalent arsenic compounds, suggesting differences in arsenic transport. In hair and feathers the formation of arsenic(III)-sulphur
                  compounds may be evidence of arsenic binding to keratin proteins which has been hypothesized to occur, and may contribute to the observed reduction of exogenous arsenic
                  contamination.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Opportunistic Beamforming is a promising scheme with potential usage in a variety of applications&#xD; ranging from cellular audio/video communications to wireless
                  mesh-networks. However, some&#xD; aspects in this scheme are open to further improvements, such as effective quality of service (QoS)&#xD; provisioning, and efficient handling of
                  sparse/realistic networks.&#xD; We focus on the downlink channel of a multi-rate time-division multiplexing MISO (multiple&#xD; input single output) point-to-multi-point wireless
                  communication system, and design a cross-layer&#xD; scheme. We employ a two-stage opportunistic scheduler. The scheduler receives channel state information&#xD; in the form of SNR
                  (signal to noise ratio) measurements from each terminal, and schedules&#xD; one terminal in each time-slot. At the first stage in a time-slot a terminal is chosen, and our
                  gradient&#xD; descent channel estimator finds an estimation of its channel vector. Then the beamformer produces&#xD; a beamforming vector in an adjacent pilot channel, or in the
                  first part of the time-slot in the data&#xD; channel. Our beamforming is based on the estimation of the channel, as opposed to the random&#xD; beamformer used in the opportunistic
                  beamforming. Each terminal measures its perceived SNR&#xD; even when the channel is assigned to another terminal, and sends this information back to the basestation&#xD; subject to a
                  feedback-reduction policy. The scheduler uses the new channel state information&#xD; for its second stage and assigns a terminal for the succeeding time-slot. The channel estimation
                  procedure&#xD; uses the reported SNRs for each terminal, which is a significantly lower feedback rate than&#xD; the amount required for coherent beamforming. Our approach efficiently
                  handles sparse/realistic&#xD; networks, and also provides a better QoS than the opportunistic beamforming scheme.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Ringdown spectroscopy (RDS) is an absorption spectroscopic and detection&#xD; technique that makes use of an optical cavity to realize a long effective pathlength&#xD;
                  through a sample and to render the measurement independent of intensity. These two&#xD; features give RDS an advantage over traditional absorption techniques and allows its&#xD;
                  application in measuring concentrations of strongly absorbing analytes present in trace&#xD; amounts, or in measuring weak absorptions for analytes in higher concentrations. The&#xD;
                  resonant optical cavities used here are created from optical fibre. This permits the easy&#xD; construction of an inexpensive apparatus for RDS. The performance of various
                  cavity&#xD; geometries (linear, circular) in three ranges of the visible and near infrared spectrum (405,&#xD; 800, and 1550 nm) was examined. Concurrent multiexponential decays
                  arising from core&#xD; modes, cladding modes, and amplified spontaneous emission were analyzed in the&#xD; framework of an exponential decay model transformed into the frequency
                  domain.&#xD; The small mode field diameter of light within a fibre is well suited to probing very&#xD; small liquid volumes on the order of pico- or femtolitres. This uniquely
                  positions optical&#xD; waveguide-based RDS for application in absorption detection for separation techniques&#xD; such as capillary electrophoresis (CE) and high performance liquid
                  chromatography&#xD; (HPLC) where high time resolution detection is required across narrow separation&#xD; channels. The experimental and theoretical work presented here was preformed
                  with an&#xD; eye towards this purpose.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis studies the role of the banking system in several aspects of the macroeconomy, including the likelihood of financial&#xD; crises, volatility of asset prices and
                  the transmission of monetary policy.&#xD; &#xD; &#xD; In chapter 2, I analyze the accumulation of international reserves by central banks as insurance against financial crises. In
                  the&#xD; model, private banks borrow from foreign creditors to invest in domestic projects. By lending to banks in response to liquidity&#xD; shocks, the central bank can reduce the
                  liquidation of bank assets and lower the probability of bank runs. I show that the&#xD; central bank will hold more reserves when private banks hold lower reserves. I also find that
                  if the central bank can borrow&#xD; additional loans from external sources, then domestic banks will hold fewer reserves by themselves. If the borrowing cost of&#xD; external loan is
                  very high, then the central bank may actually want to accumulate more reserves in order to avoid borrowing from&#xD; external sources at high costs.&#xD; &#xD; &#xD; In chapter 3, I
                  show that the ability of banks to supply liquidity through money creation is important for financial stability.&#xD; By supplying liquidity, banks can smooth the sale of assets and
                  stabilize asset prices. I find that without elastic money, the&#xD; attempt of non-bank mutual funds to raise cash by selling assets will only add more volatility into the market.
                  Elastic money&#xD; provided by banks can help mutual funds better smooth the consumption of their shareholders.&#xD; &#xD; &#xD; &#xD; In chapter 4, we consider the role of elastic
                  money in an different environment where liquidity shocks affect agents&#xD; asymmetrically. We show how money growth and interest rate policy can be used to adjust the consumption
                  level of households. We&#xD; find that the optimal policy is affected by the sensitivity of the supply price to the interest rate. When the supply price is&#xD; more sensitive to the
                  interest rate, it would be better to adopt a higher inflation rate, and to make the zero-bound of nominal&#xD; interest rate less likely to be binding.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>During viral infections, CD8+ T cells only respond to a select few epitopes derived from the respective foreign pathogen. These epitopes can be organized into a hierarchy,
                  based on their ability to induce T cell priming. Such phenomenon is known as immunodominance. Cytotoxic T cells can be primed through the direct pathway, or the cross-priming
                  pathway. The latter involves exogenously derived viral epitope presentation by uninfected professional antigen presenting cells. &#xD; It has been previously reported that
                  Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis nucleoprotein expressed in HEK cells (HEK-NP) could be cross presented to CD8+ T cells. In these studies we have used this same HEK-NP model to study the
                  effects of LCMV-NP cross priming on the LCMV immunodominance hierarchy following viral challenge. Our results provide strong evidence that cross priming is an efficient route with
                  which to induce cell-mediated immunity. We also highlight a regulatory role for cross priming in immunodominance by showing that a single dose of HEK-NP can completely shift the
                  immunodominance hierarchy of a typical LCMV infection. Furthermore, we see that the induction of LCMV-NP cross priming boosts anti-viral immunity to subsequent LCMV infections. &#xD;
                  This work provides strong support for the physiological role that cross priming plays in normal cell-mediated immune responses. It may also provide relevant information to the realm
                  of immunotherapy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The archaeal flagellum is a unique motility structure. Although functionally similar to the bacterial flagellum, the archaeal flagellum shares more similarities to the
                  bacterial type IV pilus. Using the methanogenic archaea Methanococcus voltae and Methanococcus maripaludis as model organisms, the structural and post-translational requirements for
                  flagellation have been investigated.&#xD; Known to contain glycosylated flagellin proteins, the N-glycosylation pathway was studied in M. voltae. A number of possible glycosylation
                  component genes, including glycosyl transferases, flippases and an oligosaccharyl transferase were inactivated or deleted in M. voltae and their resulting phenotypes were
                  characterized. Four glycosyl transferases were identified as involved in the assembly of the M. voltae glycan structure, with three of these enzymes, AglA, AglC1 and AglC2,
                  experimentally verified. As well, the oligosaccharyl transferase, AglB, has also been experimentally confirmed and was found to be the homolog of the bacterial and eukaryotic
                  equivalents, PglB and Stt3p, respectively. Disruption of glycan synthesis or attachment resulted in very poorly or non-flagellated cells, implicating for the first time that the
                  glycan structure on archaeal flagellins is necessary for proper flagella assembly and/or stability. These findings also represent the first proven N-glycosylation genes within the
                  domain Archaea.&#xD; New markerless, in-frame deletion methodology has allowed for advanced studies of a demonstrated and putative set of flagella-related genes in M. maripaludis.
                  This collection of 11 co-transcribed genes, consisting of three flagellin genes (flaB1-flaB3), six genes of unknown function (flaC-flaH) and two genes implicated in flagellin subunit
                  export (flaI and flaJ), make up the fla operon in this organism. Each gene from flaB1-flaI was systematically targeted for deletion and complementation to determine its necessity for
                  flagellation. The analysis showed that both major flagellins, FlaB1 and FlaB2 are required for flagellation, while the minor flagellin, FlaB3, was required for the hook-like region
                  of the flagella filament. FlaC, FlaF, FlaG and FlaH were shown for the first time to be essential for flagellation, while a naturally-occurring, truncated version of FlaD was found
                  not to be required. These results continue to develop our understanding of the archaeal flagellum and the components necessary for its assembly and/or structure.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Romantic relationship dissolution has been implicated in the onset of mood disorders (Monroe et al.,1999; Overbeek et al., 2003). It is therefore imperative that
                  researchers and mental health professionals have an understanding of the factors that contribute to dysfunctional responses so as to assist vulnerable individuals with developing
                  healthy strategies for coping with relationship dissolution. Prior research on the relationship between initiator status (i.e., who ended the relationship) and subsequent emotional
                  distress has been mixed, with multiple researchers finding that a person's level of distress was unrelated to whether he or she ended the relationship. I hypothesized that the effect
                  of initiator status on post-break-up distress would vary as a function of trait self-esteem such that individuals with low self-esteem would experience more distress after being
                  rejected by their partners, whereas individuals with high self-esteem would be no more distressed after a rejection than after acting as the rejecter.&#xD; &#xD; I tested this
                  hypothesis using two designs. First, I used a prospective, naturalistic design in which university students were assessed for emotional responses following the dissolution of their
                  romantic relationships. Those who had self-reported lower trait self esteem at the outset of the study experienced higher levels of break-up-specific distress. On the other hand,
                  those who had reported higher trait self-esteem did not exhibit differing distress levels as a function of who ended the relationship. This pattern was replicated in a laboratory
                  design in which university students imagined breaking up with their partners. Participants with low trait self-esteem experienced more negative mood, reported lower state
                  self-esteem, and evaluated themselves more negatively after a scenario in which they were rejected as compared to a scenario in which they rejected their partners. Participants with
                  high self-esteem did not differ on any of these variables as a function of rejection condition. Results are discussed in terms of the theoretical implications for understanding
                  self-esteem processes and the effects of romantic rejection. Implications for interventions for individuals with low self-esteem who are coping with romantic rejection are also
                  explored.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The ultimate goal of this project was to improve the sensitivity and detection limits of inductively coupled plasma time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ICP-TOFMS) and then
                  apply it to the speciation analysis of As. To this end, two approaches were taken: the use of organic modifiers and that of a pre-evaporation interface between the spray chamber and
                  the plasma torch.&#xD; &#xD; The radial profiles of some background ions and analytes in three different matrices (1% HNO3, 1% HNO3 with 2% v/v methanol, 1% HNO3 with 0.2% m/v sodium
                  dodecylsulfate (SDS)) were investigated in ICP-TOFMS. Although these concentrations of methanol and SDS induced the same increase (37%) in sample introduction efficiency, the change
                  in analyte signal as a function of m/z followed opposite trends in these two matrices. The results show that matrix effects arising from different organic modifiers affected the
                  distribution of ions in the plasma differently as a result of changes induced in the predominant ionisation mechanisms in the plasma.&#xD; &#xD; The effect of a pre-evaporation
                  interface on the distribution of ions in ICP-TOFMS was also investigated by spatial profiling, which showed that the optimal axial position of all elements shifted closer to the load
                  coil. Furthermore, the radial profiles became significantly narrower and Gaussian. The decrease of droplet size thus improved the sensitivity and detection limits for multi-elemental
                  analysis.&#xD; &#xD; A further investigation of the effect of the pre-evaporation interface revealed that, for cationic analytes, the signal enhancement had an inverse dependency on
                  analyte mass upon heating the interface. In the case of As, a signal enhancement upon heating the interface only resulted when concomitant ionic analytes were present or with a 0.01
                  M NaOH matrix. All these observations could be rationalised by changes in the number of Coulomb fission events occurring during pre-evaporation, which depend on the size and charge
                  of droplets, as well as the identity and concentration of the matrix.&#xD; &#xD; Finally, the baseline separation of four As species by ion exchange liquid chromatography with
                  detection by ICP-TOFMS and application of the pre-evaporation interface tube to As speciation were achieved using a mobile phase of NH4NO3, following an investigation of its matrix
                  effects.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Considerable amount of inappropriate antibiotic utilization has been observed in both acute and non-acute care hospitals. Literature has shown that strategies
                  such as an order entry (OE) and computer decision support system (DSS) have improved prescribing practices in acute care settings. However, there is limited research on the effect of
                  OE on antibiotic utilization in non-acute care settings.&#xD; Objective: To determine the relationship between OE with DSS and antibiotic utilization in a complex continuing care and
                  rehabilitation hospital. &#xD; Methods: A retrospective analysis of OE and Pharmacy dispensing data, prospectively collected between July 1, 1999 and December 31, 2005, was
                  conducted. Dispensing events for oral and intravenous antibiotics were merged with corresponding OE’s (when present) to form a final database of 4,739 dispensing events with 2,397
                  OE’s. The presence of OE and the proportion of OE to dispensing events formed the exposure variable while antibiotic utilization in defined daily dose (DDD) was calculated using dose
                  and number of doses of an antibiotic. Antibiotic utilization was examined at the hospital and individual service in-patient unit levels (complex continuing care/CCC and
                  rehabilitation medicine/REH). Statistical analysis consisting of multiple regression modeling was conducted to determine the association between use of OE and antibiotic utilization.
                  &#xD; Results: A best-fit model using multiple regression analysis at hospital level indicated a significant positive relationship between the presence of OE and antibiotic
                  utilization when service, patient age, gender and antibiotic classes were accounted for. This model explained 11% of the variation in antibiotic utilization. No significant
                  associations were found in the CCC in-patient unit while in the REH in-patient unit a significant positive relationship between the presence of OE and antibiotic utilization was
                  observed. Similarly, antibiotic utilization increased significantly with increase in the proportion of OE to dispensing events at the hospital and REH in-patient unit levels but not
                  in the CCC in-patient unit. &#xD; Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate that antibiotic utilization increased over the years following the inception of the OE system with
                  DSS at the study hospital. Further research is required to examine the effect of OE with a rudimentary DSS on antibiotic utilization management in non-acute care.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The service life of rigid sewer pipes is often controlled by joint integrity. Leaking joints can cause ingress of water and develop voids where surrounding soil has eroded.
                  The influence of soil voids on the stability of buried rigid pipes is investigated, considering the effects of void size, void location and void shape. &#xD; &#xD; A series of
                  simplified void geometries are defined, and their influence on bending moments in the rigid sewer is studied through finite element analysis. Elastic analysis indicates that the
                  bending moments from expanding voids at the springline will increase slowly, accelerating once the void spans a 45 degree arc, approximately doubling at 90 degrees, and tripling if
                  the loosened backfill is modeled for shear failure. This preliminary study suggests that the growth of erosion voids should be stopped before they reach 45 degrees, but validation
                  through physical testing is necessary. &#xD; &#xD; Elastic-plastic finite element analysis is used to calculate the deformation of rigid fractured pipe with different thicknesses,
                  considering both bonded and full-slip interface conditions. The analysis confirms that bonded idealized flexible pipe theory is very effective for calculation of increases in
                  horizontal diameter of the fractured pipe. Furthermore, decreases in vertical diameter can be simply related to increase in horizontal diameter using (1-2t/OD) obtained from
                  fractured pipe kinematics. &#xD; Both elastic and elastic-plastic finite element analyses used to study the deformations of fractured rigid pipe reveal that contact angle appears to
                  be the dominant factor affecting fractured pipe deformations. Deformation of the damaged rigid pipe increases dramatically with void growth and accelerates when erosion void contacts
                  with the outer surface of the pipe over an arc greater than 45 degrees. Computational analyses examine the behavior of centrifuge model tests which examine soil load transfer to
                  flexible sewer liners after fracture and erosion voids form nearby. The magnitude of deformation changes for finite element models is found to be comparable to observations when
                  voids are formed at springline. However the development patterns are dramatically different as voids located under the invert, and it appears that the laboratory test featured
                  physical characteristics that are not modeled in the analysis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis examines the design of high speed transimpedance amplifiers (TIAs) in low cost complimentary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. Due to aggressive
                  scaling, CMOS has become an attractive technology for high speed analog circuits. Besides the cost advantage, CMOS offers the potential for higher levels of integration since the
                  analog circuits can be integrated with digital electronics on the same substrate. &#xD; &#xD; A 2.5 Gbps transimpedance amplifier fabricated using 0.18 um CMOS technology is
                  presented. The TIA uses a shunt-shunt feedback topology with a cascode gain stage. Measurements of the transimpedance gain, group delay, and common mode rejection ratio are presented
                  for the TIA and show a good match to simulated results. The noise of the TIA was characterized by measuring the noise parameters of the TIA. The noise parameters are then used to
                  determine the input referred noise current spectral density.&#xD; &#xD; A 10 Gbps transimpedance amplifier fabricated using 0.18 um CMOS technology is also presented. This TIA uses a
                  shunt-shunt feedback topology with a common source gain stage. In order to achieve the required bandwidth, the TIA uses a bandwidth extension technique called shunt-series inductive
                  peaking. A discussion of the different methods of bandwidth extension using inductive peaking is included, and the optimal configurations for maximally &#xD; flat responses are shown
                  for shunt inductive peaking,series inductive peaking, and shunt-series inductive peaking. The TIA circuit topology is optimized using a novel noise analysis that uses a high
                  frequency noise model for the transistor. The optimum transistor size and bias current are determined to minimize the amplifier noise. Unfortunately differential measured results are
                  not available due to a stability problem in the amplifier. The cause of this instability is further explored and modifications to solve the problem are discussed. Single-ended
                  results are presented and show reasonable agreement with simulated results. Differences in the results are attributed to poor modelling of the on-chip spiral inductors.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>As a contraceptive technology, women’s sterilization is a medical event that is uniquely situated in relation to the dominant discursive link between women and
                  reproduction. Intended as a contraceptive option that permanently ends a woman’s potential ability to sexually reproduce, women’s sterilization presents a significant point for
                  exploring the discursive formation of femininity, and how the concepts thereof relate to broader questions of access, control, and regulation of sterilization and the female
                  sterilization patient. This study uses a Foucauldian feminist theory of discourse to explore such questions in a qualitative discourse analysis of women’s sterilization, from both a
                  historical perspective and from within contemporary medical texts. Sterilization has had a particularly tumultuous history in the provision of reproductive healthcare for women;
                  situated within public health and welfare discourse that differentiates the “unfit” from the “fit” reproducers, women have been forcibly sterilized under classist and racist eugenic
                  programs, while subtle yet coercive forms of sterilization abuse continue to occur as inequality of reproductive healthcare access is an ongoing issue for immigrant women, poor
                  women, and women of colour. In light of this historical analysis, as well as the impact of feminist and bioethics discourse upon contemporary medical practice, an analysis of medical
                  texts further explores the association of women with reproduction in the discursive form of the sterilization patient. This study argues that the sterilization patient is situated
                  within a discourse of ideal femininity, associated with normalized forms of mothering, sexuality, and family structure. Given the historical link between the discursive “fit”
                  reproducer, these concepts have continued implications for women’s experience of accessing sterilization as a contraceptive option.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The World Health Organization (WHO) states that iron deficiency (ID) is the preeminent global micronutrient deficiency. Maternal ID is linked to cardiovascular disease and
                  hypertension in offspring, and yet the impact of ID on the kidney is not known. We characterized the impact of ID on circulating and tissue levels of iron and renal function. &#xD;
                  &#xD; Seven and ten week old male and female Wistar rats were fed either control (270ppm) or low iron (3ppm) diet for ten weeks. Total, non-heme and heme iron levels in liver, kidney
                  cortex and kidney medulla were measured following the dietary period. Hematocrit decreased most in males regardless of age (Male 7-17wk: 47%→ 31%; 10-20wk: 47%→ 33.5%; Female 7-17wk:
                  47%→ 34%; 10-20wk: 47%→ 39%). Dietary ID markedly decreased liver and kidney cortex non-heme iron in both males and females (Female: liver-178±25 to 21±7 ppm; kidney cortex-51±9 ppm
                  to 10±1 ppm; Male: liver-102±18 ppm to 11±1 ppm; kidney cortex 36±14 to 15±8 ppm). In contrast, non-heme iron in the kidney medulla was not significantly decreased&#xD; &#xD;
                  Secondly, in order to determine the impact of ID on renal function, blood pressure was monitored using radio-telemetry starting at six weeks of age (~175g body weight). Dietary salt
                  challenge (5 days Low5 days HighNormal) was administered to all animals (n=16) starting at eight weeks of age. At ten weeks rats were assigned to either control (225pm) or low
                  (3ppm) iron diet. Dietary salt challenge was repeated at 13 and 18 weeks of age respectively. Despite significant lowering of hematocrit (Control 45%  Low iron 38.6%) hemodynamic
                  changes were minimal, in that, although blood pressure was lowered following ten weeks of dietary iron restriction, blood pressure did not change in response to dietary salt (Control
                  MAP:105.0 ± 2.5mmHg; ID MAP:100.6 ± 3.2mmHg ).&#xD; &#xD; Collectively the tissue and functional analyses demonstrate that the body adapts to lowering of tissue iron supply with ID.
                  The relative sparing of non-heme iron in the kidney medulla suggests that iron in this region of the kidney may be spared because of its importance in the systems responsible for
                  regulating fluid and sodium balance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Complexity theory investigates complex systems and how parts of a system give rise to collective behaviours. My thesis focuses upon the nature of the complex systems
                  emerging within the classrooms of three award-winning high school physics teachers in Ontario.&#xD; Using vignettes for each teacher and their classroom system, I have highlighted
                  themes related to the emergence of collective behaviours. My interpretations found the first classroom collective agreeing to work towards academic excellence with the intention of
                  achieving success in university. The second classroom collective was invested in relationship-building and used the resulting emphasis on teamwork and group-oriented learning to
                  further physics understanding. The final classroom system was in the process of learning to grapple with discovering physics through following and contending with the results of
                  their instincts. From a complex systems perspective, differences amongst teachers and students and different sets of interactions result in unique systems. Therefore, a single
                  prescription for the emergence of certain collective behaviours is unlikely.&#xD; The journal/commentary format traces my changing understandings of complexity thinking in education
                  and how those understandings made an impact on the way I approached and reflected upon the observations of the study. As such, the thesis also documents shifts in perspectives
                  highlighting the tensions felt between reductionist and complexivist thinking. Ultimately, complexity thinking illuminated how important it was to consider the teacher as part of the
                  system instead of separated from it. Further issues relating to complex emergence and physics education that lead to greater pedagogical awareness are discussed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis represents an attempt to generalize the classical Theory of Optimal Design to popular regression models, based on Rational and Spline approximations. The
                  problem of finding optimal designs for such models can be reduced to solving certain minimax problems. Explicit solutions to such&#xD; problems can be obtained only in a few selected
                  models, such as polynomial regression.&#xD; &#xD; Even when an optimal design can be found, it has, from the point of view of modern nonparametric regression, certain drawbacks. For
                  example, in the polynomial regression case, the optimal design crucially depends on the degree m of approximating polynomial.&#xD; Hence, it can be used only when such degree is
                  given/known in advance.&#xD; &#xD; We present a partial, but practical, solution to this problem. Namely, the so-called Super Chebyshev Design has been found, which does not depend
                  on the degree m of the underlying&#xD; polynomial regression in a large range of m, and at the same time is asymptotically more than 90% efficient. Similar results are obtained in
                  the case of rational regression, even though the exact form of optimal design in this case remains unknown.&#xD; &#xD; Optimal Designs in the case of Spline Interpolation are also
                  currently unknown. This problem, however, has a simple solution in the case of Cardinal Spline Interpolation. Until recently, this model has been practically unknown in modern
                  nonparametric&#xD; regression. We demonstrate the usefulness of Cardinal Kernel Spline Estimates in nonparametric regression, by proving their&#xD; asymptotic optimality, in certain
                  classes of smooth functions. In this way, we have found, for the first time, a theoretical justification of a well known empirical observation, by which cubic splines suffice, in
                  most practical applications.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In the last two decades, research has established a negative association between involvement in bullying and emotional health difficulties. Few studies, in comparison,
                  explore the relationship between bullying and victimization and physical health. Moreover, studies are lacking on the influence of bullying on health in adolescence. Three studies
                  were conducted to explore the association between bullying and adolescent positive and negative health behaviours. Using an ecological model, we examined the influence of bullying
                  and victimization on physical activity and health status, risky sexual behaviours and sexual coercion, and dating violence perpetration and victimization. Each study explored how
                  bullying influenced the relationship between environmental factors and adolescent health. Results suggest that both bullying and victimization can have a negative influence on risky
                  health behaviours. As well, the findings suggest that relationships with adults may protect youth involved in bullying from negative health experiences. These results support a model
                  of co-occurring health behaviours in youth, including involvement in bullying. Hence, we propose that teen health promotion programs target overall lifestyle choices rather than
                  solely focusing on individual health behaviours. As well, we recommend that bullying prevention programs need to address engagement in unhealthy habits during adolescence, while
                  being sensitive to the complex relationship between environmental and bullying factors that can influence physical health in adolescence.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The proportional hazards model developed by Cox (1972) is by far the most widely used method for regression analysis of censored survival data. Application of the Cox model
                  to more general event history data has become possible through extensions using counting process theory (e.g., Andersen and Borgan (1985), Therneau and Grambsch (2000)). With its
                  development based entirely on counting processes, Aalen’s additive risk model offers a flexible, nonparametric alternative. Ordinary least squares, weighted least squares and ridge
                  regression have been proposed in the literature as estimation schemes for Aalen’s model (Aalen (1989), Huffer and McKeague (1991), Aalen et al. (2004)). This thesis develops
                  data-driven parameter selection criteria for the weighted least squares and ridge estimators. Using simulated survival data, these new methods are evaluated against existing
                  approaches. A survey of the literature on the additive risk model and a demonstration of its application to real data sets are also provided.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Freshwater ecosystems face unprecedented levels of human-induced stresses and it is expected that the invasion of non-indigenous species will cause the greatest loss of
                  biodiversity in lakes and rivers worldwide. Bythotrephes longimanus is a predatory invertebrate that invaded North America in the early 1980s, first being detected in the Great
                  Lakes, and then moving to a number of inland lakes in Ontario and the northern United States. Using experimental and survey-based approaches, I tested several hypotheses concerning
                  the effects of Bythotrephes on native zooplankton community structure and function. My results indicate that Bythotrephes reduces total abundance, biomass, and richness of
                  zooplankton, especially cladoceran taxa, throughout the ice-free season. As a result of high predation pressure by the invader, total seasonal and epilimnetic zooplankton production
                  was also substantially reduced in invaded lakes, which may have important consequences for the transfer of energy to fish and other taxa that feed on zooplankton. Interestingly,
                  there was some evidence that zooplankton shifted their reproduction in time and space to avoid Bythotrephes, which may buffer the effects of the invader on food web functioning.
                  Other measures of ecosystem function were relatively unaffected by the invasion of Bythotrephes. In addition, Bythotrephes may interact in unexpected ways with other anthropogenic
                  stressors, and act to slow down the process of recovery by preying on species that maintain community abundance during acidification, but also affecting species attempting to
                  recolonize historically acidified lakes. Although dispersal of zooplankton may maintain some of the ecosystem functions provided by zooplankton communities, loss of biodiversity may
                  be a permanent result of invasion. The effects of the continued spread of invasive species across the landscape may be profound, as the invader Bythotrephes has demonstrably altered
                  zooplankton communities and may reduce the ability of freshwater ecosystems to respond to future environmental change and maintain ecosystem functioning.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Reduction theory for systems with symmetry deals with the problem of understanding dynamics on a manifold with an action of a Lie group. In geometric mechanics, this
                  problem can be formulated in the Lagrangian, Hamiltonian or affine connection frameworks. While the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations have been well developed, the results
                  obtained in these setups are based on variational principles and symplectic geometry. These methods cannot be used directly in the affine connection formulation unless additional
                  structure is available.&#xD; &#xD; In this thesis, a manifold with an arbitrary affine connection is considered, and the geodesic spray associated with the connection is studied in
                  the presence of a Lie group action. In particular, results are obtained that provide insight into the structure of the reduced dynamics associated with the given invariant affine
                  connection. The geometry of the frame bundle of the given manifold is used to provide an intrinsic description of the geodesic spray. A fundamental relationship between the geodesic
                  spray, the tangent lift and the vertical lift of the symmetric product is obtained, which provides a key to understanding reduction in this formulation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis proposed two nonparametric statistical tests, based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance and L2 mallows disatnce. &#xD; To implement the proposed tests,
                  nonparametric bootstrap method is employed to approximate the distributions of the test statistics to construct the corresponding bootstrap confidence interval procedures.
                  Monte-Carlo simulations are performed to investigate the actual type I error of the proposed bootstrap procedures. It is found that the type I error of the bootstrap BC confidence
                  interval procedure is close to the nominal level when censoring is not heavy and the boosttrap percentile confidence interval procedure works well when Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance is
                  used to characterize the equivalence. When the data is heavily censored, the procedures based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance have very conservative type I errors, while the
                  procedures based on the Mallows distance are very liberal.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>An understanding of the shape and nature of galaxy density profiles remains a major challenge to galaxy structure studies. The physical mechanisms thought to control these
                  profiles include star formation rates and dynamical interactions, but we focus in this thesis on the contribution of dynamical parameters associated with the dark and baryonic
                  matter. We follow the evolution of mass density profiles, and investigate the development of a truncation radius. Using GADGET-2, an N-body/SPH code with a prescription for star
                  formation and feedback, and the SHARCNET computational facilities, we have generated over 200 galaxy models covering a full range of structural parameters. The galaxy models have a
                  minimum of 1.4 million particles and most are evolved over a period of 10 Gyr.&#xD; &#xD; We find that the evolution of the galaxy mass density profile is controlled by the ratio of
                  the disk mass fraction, $m_{d}$, to the halo spin parameter, $\lambda$. The strength of the two-component structure in disk profiles and speed at which this structure develops, is
                  directly proportional to $m_{d}/\lambda$. While the development of a two-component profile is coupled to bar formation, not all barred galaxies develop a two-component profile.&#xD;
                  &#xD; We also show that the slope of the outer profile is in close agreement with that of the initial profile and remains stable over time, whereas the inner profile slope evolves
                  considerably. This result will greatly improve comparisons of observed with predicted measures of galaxy density profiles.&#xD; &#xD; Our galaxy database is the largest of its kind
                  and a valuable resource for many potential galaxy structural studies. We conclude with a list of future investigations based on our study and new database.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The MexCD-OprJ multidrug efflux pump of Pseudomonas aeruginosa confers resistance to a range of antimicrobials. Although not expressed under normal laboratory conditions,
                  exposure to the membrane-active biocides, chlorhexidine or benzalkonium chloride, results in mexCD-oprJ expression. This suggests that membrane disruption provides the inducing
                  signal. Consistent with this, increased mexCD-oprJ expression was demonstrated in the presence of additional membrane-damaging agents including polymyxin B, ethanol, SDS, EDTA, the
                  organic solvents n-hexane and p-xylene, and the antimicrobial peptides melittin, V8 and V681. MexCD-OprJ expression was initially verified through increased resistance to known
                  MexCD-OprJ antimicrobial substrates and subsequently using a mexC-lacZ transcriptional fusion and RT-PCR. Since the P. aeruginosa sigma factor AlgU is responsive to envelope stress,
                  it was of interest to ascertain whether AlgU is capable of mediating this increased mexCD-oprJ expression. Thus, the impact of AlgU loss on mexCD-oprJ expression in response to
                  membrane-damaging agents was assessed in a algU strain. In contrast with above, little or no mexCD-oprJ expression (assessed using resistance to MexCD-OprJ antimicrobial substrates,
                  the mexC-lacZ transcriptional fusion and RT-PCR) occurred in response to membrane-damaging agents in the algU strain, consistent with AlgU playing a role in the envelope stress
                  inducibility of mexCD-oprJ. Overall, envelope stress, and the ability to react to this stress through AlgU, appears to play an important role in mexCD-oprJ induction. This suggests
                  an important role for MexCD-OprJ in alleviating envelope stress, independent of its ability to export and provide resistance to antimicrobials. A gene, PA4596, whose product shows
                  substantial homology to the NfxB repressor of mexCD-oprJ expression, occurs downstream of mexCD-oprJ and shows AlgU-dependence and chlorhexidine inducibility, suggesting a role in
                  the chlorhexidine-induced, AlgU-mediated expression of mexCD-oprJ. Thus, the impact of PA4596 loss on mexCD-oprJ expression was assessed. Paradoxically, the loss of PA4596 increases
                  mexCD-oprJ expression in wild-type cells in response to chlorhexidine treatment (as assessed through RT-PCR), while its loss compromises mexCD-oprJ expression in an nfxB mutant.
                  Nonetheless, this suggests that PA4596 is involved in the induction of mexCD-oprJ and that its ability to induce mexCD-oprJ differs depending on the state of nfxB.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Brittle features along two prominent shear zones in the Grenville Province of southeastern Ontario, the Central Metasedimentary Belt boundary thrust zone (CMBbtz) and
                  Robertson Lake mylonite zone (RLmz), are investigated to understand the brittle deformation history of this intraplate region. Evolution of brittle deformation is interpreted from
                  detailed mapping and characterization of joint, fault and vein patterns in Proterozoic basement rocks, Paleozoic cover rocks and Pleistocene sediments. Relationships among joint and
                  fault orientations and maximum-horizontal stress directions associated with major tectonic events suggest a history of repeated stages of deformation along the CMBbtz and RLmz.
                  Neoproterozoic-Cambrian opening of the Iapetus Ocean is interpreted to have produced NNE-striking Proterozoic structural highs in Paleozoic cover above the RLmz. Normal faults
                  striking NW to WNW and ESE-striking dextral strike-slip faults in the RLmz and Paleozoic cover above both shear zones are compatible with Ordovician-Devonian Taconic and Acadian
                  stresses. Prominent NNE- and NW-striking subvertical joint sets along the RLmz, CMBbtz and Paleozoic cover above the CMBbtz are compatible with Late Carboniferous to Permian
                  Alleghanian stresses. Brittle features attributed to Mesozoic opening of the Atlantic Ocean are numerous and include: NNE-, ENE-, NW- and WNW-striking subvertical joint sets,
                  WNW-striking normal faults, and NNE-striking normal faults in Paleozoic cover above the RLmz; NNW-striking dextral strike-slip faults and NW-striking normal faults in the RLmz; N-
                  and NW-striking normal faults in Paleozoic cover above the CMBbtz; and, E- and SSW-striking normal faults in the CMBbtz. Joint sets in Pleistocene sediments above the CMBbtz and RLmz
                  (oriented NNE, NW, NE, NNW and ENE) are compatible with both Pleistocene post-glacial flexural stress and the current in-situ stress. Strike-slip faults oriented SSW and W in the
                  CMBbtz and a NNW-striking reverse fault in the RLmz are compatible with the current regional stress field. Further understanding of this neotectonic deformation is relevant to assess
                  the seismic risk in the intraplate region of southern Ontario.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The objective of this thesis was to explore the chemistry of series of linear and star shaped compounds based on benzimidazolyl, 2-(2’-pyridyl)benzimidazolyl, and
                  2,2’-dipyridylamino functional groups. These groups all possess Lewis base sites suitable for metal coordination, and are all known fluorophores.&#xD; The first compounds to be
                  presented are the homo-substituted benzimidazolyl derivatives. Compounds 2.1-2.5 have been fully characterized and are all luminescent with emission energies in the UV region. While
                  coordination complexes with these ligands have not been isolated, the effect of metal ion complexation on ligand luminescence has been explored via metal ion titration experiments.
                  Furthermore, these compounds all have electron affinities greater than -3.0 eV and large optical bandgaps that range between 3.55 and 3.95 eV. These compounds also have high thermal
                  and morphological stability. In light of this, compound 2.3 was selected as a representative example, and further characterized as an electron transport/hole blocking material for
                  OLED applications. It has demonstrated a performance comparable to that of the well known electron transport material Alq3 (q = 8-hydroxyquinolinate).&#xD; The second class of
                  compounds, 3.2 and 3.3, represent a pair of hetero-substituted ligands with two different binding sites available for coordination chemistry. A copper (I) complex of 3.3 has been
                  isolated and exhibits orange phosphorescence at room temperature and at 77 K. Furthermore, a series of metal titration experiments have been performed on 3.3 and 3.4, and have
                  demonstrated the preference of different metal ions for either the 2,2’-dipyridylamino site, or the 2-(2’-pyridyl)benzimidazolyl binding site. The details of these explorations will
                  be presented in the subsequent chapters.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This research sought to clarify the construct of life meaning by creating a new, multidimensional measure of life meaning. In an initial study, 392 university
                  undergraduates (317 women, 75 men) completed several existing life meaning measures. Exploratory factor analytic procedures undertaken on the item responses supported the extraction
                  of 10 factors: Achievement, Framework/Purpose, Religion, Death Acceptance, Interpersonal Satisfaction, Fulfillment/Excitement, Giving to the World, Existential Vacuum, Intimacy, and
                  Control. Of the original 170 items, the 64 items with the highest factor loadings were retained, and together comprise the Multidimensional Life Meaning Scale (MLMS). Higher-order
                  exploratory factor analyses yielded three factors: Personal Efficacy, Self-Transcendence, and Fulfillment. A second study, conducted with an independent sample of undergraduate
                  students (N = 262; 200 women, 62 men), provided mixed support for the factor structure of the MLMS at the item level, but replicated the higher-order factor structure revealed in the
                  initial study. The criterion-related (concurrent and discriminant) validity was also examined in the second study, by factor analyzing the MLMS factors along with criterion subscales
                  thought to be related to life meaning, and support was found for 7 of the 10 first-order factors. In a final study, support was found for the existence of group differences that were
                  hypothesized on the basis of rational links to interpreted higher-order dimensions of life meaning. In accordance with predictions, Theology students (n = 28) reported higher levels
                  of Self-Transcendence and depressed students (n = 31) indicated lower levels of Fulfillment compared to a baseline group of undergraduate students (n = 262). Contrary to
                  expectations, Law/Business students (n =35) were not significantly different from the baseline group on Personal Efficacy. Based on the results of these three studies, it is
                  concluded that the life meaning construct is multidimensional. The Multidimensional Life Meaning Scale is a promising measure of the construct, and the inclusion of both lower-order
                  and higher-order factors is a new way of conceptualizing life meaning.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Objective: In this study, the effectiveness of the modified Recovery Workbook as a psychoeducational tool for facilitating recovery in persons with serious mental illness
                  was examined. Methods: The study was a multi-center, prospective, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial. A total of 33 people receiving Assertive Community Treatment (ACT)
                  services participated in the study. For 12 weeks, a control group continued receiving their usual treatment as determined by the ACT team, and an intervention group received the
                  Recovery Workbook training in addition to the normal standard of care from the ACT team. Groups were compared using t-tests for continuous measures and chi-squared analyses with
                  correction for continuity of dichotomous measures, as appropriate. The overall effects of the Recovery Workbook Training on individuals’ perceived level of hope, empowerment,
                  knowledge, and quality of life were measured using a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Team (PCCC-MHS/Frontenac) and group (experimental/control) were the
                  between-subject factors, and time of testing (initial, final) was the within subject factor. Results: Participation in the Recovery Workbook was associated with significant change in
                  participants’ perceived sense of hope, empowerment, and goal and success orientation. These associations remained significant when commensurate demographic variables were controlled
                  for. Conclusions: This study is the first randomized controlled trial of a recovery-based psychoeducational intervention in persons with serious mental illness, and opens a new
                  chapter of evidence-based practice for implementing recovery in mental health service delivery.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The metallic single electron transistor (SET) has been shown to provide charge sensitivity on the order of 10-6 e/(Hz)1/2, when operated as a charge amplifier. This makes
                  it an ideal candidate for low-noise measurement schemes, such as monitoring nano-mechanical oscillations, or reading out the charge state of a quantum bit. The SET operates by
                  exploiting quantum tunneling across an ‘island’ between two insulating tunnel junctions, and can be modulated by a capacitively coupled gate electrode. &#xD; A metallic SET has been
                  fabricated and characterized at low frequencies. The device was fabricated on a silicon substrate coated with a bi-layer resist, using electron beam lithography. The Al-AlOx¬-Al
                  tunnel junctions were created using double angle evaporation. Samples were tested near 300 mK in a custom helium-3 cryostat system. Results which characterize the SET parameters and
                  conductance behaviour were obtained, in both the superconducting and normal states. &#xD; This thesis contains a discussion of the fabrication procedures and dc measurement
                  techniques required to produce and test a single electron transistor. Relevant background theory relating to SET operation and cryogenic laboratory techniques is presented. A brief
                  discussion of proposed future experiments using a dual gate radio frequency SET as a more sensitive amplifier is introduced.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>As a result of the legacy of industrial contamination over the last century, areas of sediment deposition in the St. Lawrence River at Cornwall, ON, contain high
                  concentrations of mercury (Hg). The popular sport-fish species, yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and walleye (Sander vitreus) have been found to contain mercury concentrations
                  exceeding Ontario Ministry of Environment consumption guidelines. Interestingly, a paradox exists between two contaminated sites – despite elevated sediment Hg concentrations at Zone
                  2, fish from Zone 1 contain higher Hg concentrations. Further research has indicated that these patterns of Hg were not attributed to growth rate, condition factor, diet composition,
                  or trophic position of yellow perch. Rather, Hg concentrations in yellow perch may be described by the heterogeneity of prey contamination and fish bioenergetics. As a result of the
                  paradox between total Hg (THg) concentrations in sediments and biota between two contaminated sites, it was necessary to examine the benthic invertebrate community and how it may
                  transfer Hg from sediments to yellow perch. This apparent paradox now extends to all prey items, since prey items from the stomach contents of yellow perch caught in Zone 1 were
                  significantly more contaminated than those of Zone 2. Use of δ15N and δ13C, measures of trophic position and energy source, respectively, indicated that prey selection, but not food
                  chain length, may also be an important factor in explaining the variation in Hg burdens in yellow perch. Small-scale patterns of biomagnification, as shown by a comparison of δ15N
                  and logTHg, indicated that the rates of biomagnification were similar among zones, but the amount of THg present at the base of the food web was twice as high at Zone 1 as at other
                  contaminated sites. Overall, the relative importance of vertical and horizontal food web structure changed spatially and temporally, highly influencing THg concentrations of prey
                  items and yellow perch.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Growing interest in biomass crops for energy production has focused attention on Panicum virgatum L. (switchgrass) as a promising perennial feedstock native to much of
                  North America. Switchgrass may be processed into products such as pulp and paper, ethanol, and fuel pellets. A robust C4 grass, switchgrass typically produces 10-12 dry tonnes/ha on
                  agricultural soils in average growing conditions; this study shows that reduced but substantive yields are also possible on soils rendered unsuitable for food crop production by lead
                  contamination over the acceptable level of 70 ppm. Switchgrass offers not only tolerance to lead in the soil environment, but also the potential for extraction of lead contaminants.
                  Integrating the growth of switchgrass for biomass with phytoremediation could provide greater opportunity for biomass production, while eventually increasing the suitability of such
                  lands for agricultural production. This study examines the potential for using switchgrass to remove lead from the soil and to translocate the contaminant to the leafy portions of
                  the plant, where it could be removed from the site through biomass harvest. Roots of plants treated with 6000 and 10000 ppm lead solution from the time of seeding displayed some
                  morphological changes and growth inhibition, yet, produced biomass comparable to expected yields and removed up to 0.1% of the applied lead solution. Established switchgrass
                  displayed few morphological changes and no significant loss of biomass when treated with lead acetate solution while extracting lead into harvestable tissues. As the primary root is
                  the organ through which water, solutes and heavy metals pass into the plant, the dense, fibrous root system of switchgrass may aid in the ability of this plant to extract
                  contaminants from soil without significantly hindering above ground biomass production. Switchgrass grown on brownfield soil, with contamination levels of up to 23600 ppm
                  translocated lead into harvestable tissues without significant changes in biomass production or growth characteristics. However, symptoms of phytotoxicity were observed in
                  switchgrass grown on soil containing 36100 ppm lead. Atomic absorption spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma analyses indicate that lead accumulation in harvestable tissues of
                  switchgrass occurs at rates comparable to those in previous studies. The presence of dark staining deposits, detected by light microscopy in the root and shoot tissue of switchgrass
                  treated with high concentrations of applied lead (13800, 10000), suggests an adaptive response within the plant. Successful integration of phytoremediation with growth of biomass
                  crops such as switchgrass may provide effective reclamation of contaminated soils, while contributing to a sustainable energy economy.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Researchers have long presumed that attitudes play a role in information processing, affecting memory in an attitude-consistent manner. This is known as congeniality. This
                  presumption was largely dismissed as a result of a large scale, comprehensive meta-analysis (Eagly et al., 1999). The current project proposed that the conditions under which
                  congeniality was tested in the past were not conducive for eliciting these effects. The present research tests cognitive capacity restrictions and salient information processing
                  goals as moderators of the effects of attitude on memory in a 3 (Information Processing Goal: Attitude Expressive vs. Alternative Perspective Taking vs. No Goal) X 2 (Time
                  Restriction: Restricted vs. Unrestricted) X 3 (Issue: Eating Red Meat vs. Marijuana Use vs. Playing Contact Sports) design. Participants were given a specific processing goal and
                  were presented with issue-relevant information at either a restricted or unrestricted time interval. After a delay, they were presented with recall and recognition tasks. Results
                  indicated that goals moderated the effects of attitudes on the favorability of correct recall such that memory tended to be biased in the same direction as the goal. Experiment 2
                  expanded this research by including a second session 48 hours later which served as a second testing phase for memory. Again, during the first session, information processing goals
                  were found to moderate the effects of attitude on the favorability of correct recall. Interestingly, the second session failed to find these effects, but instead found weak evidence
                  of global congeniality regardless of goal condition. The implications of these findings are discussed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Space-time block coding is a technique used to exploit diversity in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) environment. Orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBCs) are
                  desirable because they can achieve full transmit diversity while maintaining a simple low-complexity maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding algorithm. However, OSTBCs are limited in their
                  error performance. This has led to the development of more general linear space-time block codes, such as quasi-orthogonal space-time block codes (QOSTBCs). QOSTBCs offer better
                  error performance, but their decoding complexity is a concern since it is no longer a linear function of the number of transmitted symbols. In this thesis, a new vectorization for
                  linear STBCs is proposed that explicitly maintains the redundancy in the STBC transmission matrix. By expressing the ML metric using the new vectorization, a new generic
                  representation of the ML metric expression for a linear STBC is derived. One immediate application of this new metric expression is the convenient partial decoupling and
                  simplification of the detection metric for linear STBCs. The new metric expression can also be used as a design tool to help in the construction of new STBCs with low decoding
                  complexity. As an example, a new QOSTBC is constructed that has lower decoding complexity than one previously proposed in the literature of equal rate and diversity. A comparison is
                  conducted to answer the following question: for the family of QOSTBCs, when is it best to perform an exhaustive search using a metric expression that is simplified and decoupled as
                  much as possible, and when should an efficient implementation of the sphere decoding algorithm be applied? Determining this boundary is an important and practical issue not yet
                  directly addressed in the literature. The new metric expression can also be used as the framework for a new family of sub-optimal decoding algorithms for STBCs that trade-off error
                  performance for a reduction in decoding complexity. A practical example of such an algorithm is given as an example.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The synthesis of chiral fluorenol crystal materials employing directed ortho metalation (DoM) combined with directed remote metalation (DreM) and Suzuki-Miyauara Coupling
                  was previously reported by McCubbin, Snieckus and Lemieux.ref? This study reported that certain fluorenol derivatives form a chiral smectic C phase (SmC*) with a spontaneous
                  polarization (Ps) that is amplified by intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Dilution and deuterium exchange experiments suggest that antiparallel hydrogen bonded dimer formation
                  increases the rotational bias about the director that is thought to induce the Ps.needs definition The research reported in this thesis is concernded with an investigation on the
                  effects of hydrogen bonds on the Ps of the liquid crystal by the variation of core structure, particularly the substitution of one aryl ring to pyridinyl ring. &#xD; An efficient
                  synthesis of liquid crystals (LC) 1.14 and 2.22 by Directed ortho Metalation-boronation, Suzuki-Miyaura Cross Coupling reaction accompanied with Directed remote metalation was
                  achieved. Compound 1.14 was found to be not useful as a LC material because it was unstable in the air and underwent rapid oxidation to give 2.22 upon heating. Thus, this project was
                  focused on the preliminary study on mesophase characterization of 1.14 and 2.22. The results (Table 2.3) show both 1.14 and 2.22 formed SmC phases, but only 1.14 showed smectic A
                  (SmA) mesophase and only 2.22 showed nematic (N) mesophase cooling from isotropic liquid phase. The increase in temperature range of smectic phases for the azafluorenol 1.14 is
                  expected because intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl group and aza group as shown by Figure 1.21 may play a role to stabilize the formation of smectic (Sm)
                  phase.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Lake Challa is a 5 km2, 97m deep freshwater crater lake located at 880m elevation on the southeast slope of Mount Kilimanjaro (Kenya-Tanzania). Information gained from a
                  preliminary limnological survey of Lake Challa, presented here, will give insight into tropical limnological processes as well as aid in the paleoclimatological interpretation of a
                  25,000-yr diatom record. The survey, which included depth profiles of temperature, oxygen, pH and specific conductance, as well as epilithic and surface sediment diatom samples,
                  revealed that Lake Challa is a meromictic lake which presently has at least 30 diatom species.&#xD; A 22m sediment core, recovered in 2005, has well-preserved diatoms throughout its
                  length. Diatom species assemblages were dominated by Nitzschia sp. 1 and Gomphocymbella sp. 1, for which the taxonomy is uncertain, and therefore general ecological characteristics
                  were used in the data interpretation. An increase in Gomphocymbella sp. 1 may reflect an increase in the amount of benthic habitat and therefore lower lake levels. Diatom
                  productivity may increase during periods of high precipitation and runoff which increases the total nutrient concentration, and high Nitzschia sp. 1 concentrations occur when input
                  water has high Si:P ratios (warm, wet climate).&#xD; Analysis of the diatom record suggests that Lake Challa experienced fluctuating intermediate lake levels from 25-21 thousand
                  years before present (ka BP), low lake levels from 21-14.5 ka BP, sustained high lake levels from 14.5-11 ka BP, and high-intermediate lake levels from 11-5 ka BP but with short-term
                  recessions at 10.6-11, 8.5 and 6.6 ka BP. After 5 ka BP, levels remained fairly stable, with a gradual decrease in lake level beginning at ~4 ka BP culminating at ~1.8 ka BP.
                  Inferred climate changes from Lake Challa generally agree with other records in the area. &#xD; Continuous sedimentary records from lakes in equatorial regions on which to base
                  paleoclimatic reconstructions are rare. In conjunction with other biological and geochemical paleoproxy indicators, this high-resolution diatom record will help us better understand
                  climate-driven environmental change in the vicinity of Mount Kilimanjaro, site of the only African ice-core record.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis deals primarily with supramolecular chemistry based on cucurbit[n]uril (CB[n], n = 7 and 8) host molecules. The research has been focused on the synthesis and
                  characterization of host-guest complexes CB[n] with aromatic guest molecules, and the study of the effects of the host-guest complexation on the chemical reactivity and spectroscopic
                  properties of the included guests, such as their photoreactivity and their UV-visible absorption and emission properties, in aqueous solution.&#xD; The [4+4] photodimerization of
                  protonated 2-aminopyridine (APH+) occurs stereoselectively to give the anti-trans product as the result of a preferred orientation of two APH+ guests in the cavity of CB[7]. The
                  CB[7] host inhibits photohydration in the course of the photoisomerizations of protonated trans-1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene and trans-1,2-bis(1-methyl-4-pyridinium)ethylene by
                  including the (4-pyridyl)ethylene portion of the guest, while this is not observed with trans-1,2-bis(1-hexyl-4-pyridinium)ethylene, as preferential inclusion of the hexyl groups
                  leaves the vinyl group vulnerable to photohydration. Very strong CB[7] complexation of (E)-1-ferrocenyl-2-(1-methyl-4-pyridinium)ethylene completely inhibits the (E)→(Z)
                  photoisomerization process. &#xD; The H/D exchange rates and acidities of the C(2)-proton of cationic imidazolium and thiazolium (including thiamine and thiamine phosphates) carbon
                  acids are decreased upon their complexation with CB[7]. Inclusion of protonated aromatic amines (and aromatic alcohols) in the cavity CB[7] significantly decreases their ground and
                  excited state acidities, such that the emission is switched from the neutral amine to the protonated amine excited state, resulting in changes in the color of fluorescence. The
                  fluorescence of acridizinium cations can be switched off by the formation of 2:1 complexes with CB[8] and then switched back on again by the addition of CB[7] or a competing guest
                  molecule. &#xD; The stabilization of the deep blue color of the 4,4’-bis(dimethylamino)diphenyl carbonium ion, upon complexation of the corresponding carbinol with CB[7], results
                  from a complexation-induced shift in the carbinol/carbonium ion equilibrium. A dramatic purple to blue color change in pinacyanol chloride upon addition of CB[7] is due to a partial
                  breakup of dye aggregates, upon the interactions of the dye with the host molecule. The CB[n] complexation-induced emission and/or absorption color switch have the potential to be
                  employed in molecular switches and in chemical sensing.</dcterms:abstract>

                  reproduce hierarchies of gender, race, and class. As cultural geographers and architectural historians have argued, and as I argue in the context of Morton’s work, architecture and
                  geography exist in a reciprocal relationship with the social context in which they exist. Consequently, social histories that amass in politicized spaces referred to as “home,” such
                  as gendered suburban houses, urban shelters, segregated neighbourhoods, are often marginalized. By discussing the way Morton’s work alludes to marginalized social and spatial
                  histories within home environments, I demonstrate the ways that mainstream understanding of the subordination of marginalized groups is informed by sociospatial
                  histories.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis examined the use of two-phase partitioning bioreactors (TPPBs) for the biodegradation of poorly water-soluble compounds. TPPBs are stirred tank bioreactors
                  composed of a biocatalyst-containing aqueous phase and an immiscible second phase containing large amounts of poorly water-soluble or toxic substrates. Degradation of the
                  bioavailable substrate in the aqueous phase will result in equilibrium-driven partitioning of additional substrate from the immiscible phase into the aqueous phase, theoretically
                  allowing for complete substrate degradation.&#xD; Fundamental work was undertaken with the PCB-degrading organisms Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 in liquid-liquid and solid-liquid
                  TPPBs. Initially biphenyl was used as the sole carbon source due to its hydrophobic nature and structural similarity to the environmentally relevant PCBs. The critical LogKO/W
                  (octanol/water partitioning coefficient) of the organism was determined to be 5.5 and its growth kinetics on biphenyl were determined in a liquid-liquid TPPB. A polymer selection
                  strategy for solid-liquid TPPBs was developed in the next chapter, and it was shown in the following chapter that biphenyl degradation in solid-liquid TPPBs was mass transfer
                  limited, as described mathematically utilising the previously estimated microbial kinetics.&#xD; The fundamental knowledge gained in the early chapters was then applied to the
                  degradation of PCBs by the same organism. It was shown that the aqueous phase availability of PCBs is the rate-limiting step in biphasic bioreactors, and not the mass transfer rate.
                  The low specific microbial degradation rates, resulting from substrate-limited growth were addressed with increased biomass concentrations; however, it was also found that an
                  additional carbon source was required to maintain microbial activity over an extended period of time. Pyruvic acid was selected as a carbon source which, once added to actively
                  PCB-degrading cells, maintained the cells’ activity towards PCBs and up to 85 % of 100 mg l-1 was degraded in 15 h.&#xD; It was shown as the final contribution in this thesis that
                  TPPBs can be combined with a PCB soil extraction step as a potential remediation scheme for PCB contaminated soil. PCBs were extracted from soil with polymer beads (up to 75 %
                  removal), followed by biodegradation of the PCBs in a solid-liquid TPPB in which PCBs were delivered to the degrading organism from the same polymer.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) are well known to depend almost exclusively on milkweed (genus Asclepias) host plants for oviposition sites, as their larvae need to
                  ingest compounds critical for adult butterfly chemical defense against predators. Many phytophagous insects make fast and accurate decisions on the quality of host plants, and
                  whether or not to accept them as oviposition sites. We were interested in the cues that attract monarchs (males and females) to milkweed, while in flight, before contact stimulation
                  can occur. We developed a novel flight apparatus to test monarch attraction behaviour, under a number of different experimental protocols, to both milkweed and control stimuli in
                  order to identify the cues necessary or sufficient for monarch attraction to milkweed. Monarchs were found to be attracted to milkweed stimuli when the visual image alone of milkweed
                  was available or when olfactory cues alone were available. Attraction behaviour was maximized when both cues were available. It was also discovered that attraction to milkweed was
                  significantly diminished when ultraviolet reflection from milkweed leaves was prevented from being detected by monarchs in flight.</dcterms:abstract>

                  depression and diabetes-related stress as measured by measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the Problem Areas In Diabetes (PAID) questionnaire at baseline and
                  12-weeks. All participants completed the study. At 12 weeks, mean scores for the intervention group were significantly lower for the GDS (p = .00) and the PAID (p = .03).
                  Participants were receptive to the intervention. Nurse telephone monitoring may decrease depressive symptoms and diabetes-related stress among community-dwelling older
                  adults.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems have gained an enormous amount of attention as one of the most promising research areas in wireless communications. However,
                  while MIMO systems have been extensively explored over the past decade, few schemes acknowledge the nonlinearity caused by the use of high power amplifiers (HPAs) in the
                  communication chain. When HPAs operate near their saturation points, nonlinear distortions are introduced in the transmitted signals, and the resulting MIMO channel will be
                  nonlinear. The nonlinear distortion is further exacerbated by the fading caused by the propagation channel.&#xD; The goal of this thesis is: 1) to use neural networks (NNs) to model
                  and identify nonlinear MIMO channels; and 2) to employ the proposed NN model in designing efficient detection techniques for these types of MIMO channels.&#xD; In the first part of
                  the thesis, we follow a previous work on modeling and identification of nonlinear MIMO channels, where it has been shown that a proposed block-oriented NN scheme allows not only good
                  identification of the overall MIMO input-output transfer function but also good characterization of each component of the system. The proposed scheme employs an ordinary gradient
                  descent based algorithm to update the NN weights during the learning process and it assumes only real-valued inputs. In this thesis, natural gradient (NG) descent is used for
                  training the NN. Moreover, we derive an improved variation of the previously proposed NN scheme to avoid the input type restriction and allow for complex modulated inputs as well. We
                  also investigate the scheme tracking capabilities of time-varying nonlinear MIMO channels. Simulation results show that NG descent learning significantly outperforms the ordinary
                  gradient descent in terms of convergence speed, mean squared error (MSE) performance, and nonlinearity approximation. Moreover, the NG descent based NN provides better tracking
                  capabilities than the previously proposed NN.&#xD; The second part of the thesis focuses on signal detection. We propose a receiver that employs the neural network channel estimator
                  (NNCE) proposed in part one, and uses the Zero-Forcing Vertical Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time (ZF V-BLAST) detection algorithm to retrieve the transmitted signals. Computer
                  simulations show that in slow time-varying environments the performance of our receiver is close to the ideal V-BLAST receiver in which the channel is perfectly known. We also
                  present a NN based linearization technique for HPAs, which takes advantage of the channel information provided by the NNCE. Such linearization technique can be used for adaptive data
                  predistortion at the transmitter side or adaptive nonlinear equalization at the receiver side. Simulation results show that, when higher modulation schemes (&gt;16-QAM) are used, the
                  nonlinear distortion caused by the use of HPAs is greatly minimized by our proposed NN predistorter and the performance of the communication system is significantly
                  improved.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Processor design has evolved over the years to take advantage of new&#xD; technology and innovative concepts in order to improve performance.&#xD; Diminishing returns for
                  improvements based on current techniques&#xD; such as exploiting instruction-level parallelism have caused&#xD; designers to shift their focus. Rather then focusing on&#xD;
                  single-threaded architectures, designers have increasingly sought to&#xD; improve system performance and increase overall throughput by&#xD; exploiting thread-level parallelism
                  through multithreaded multi-core&#xD; architectures.&#xD; &#xD; Software modeling and simulation are common techniques used to aid&#xD; hardware design. Through simulation, different
                  architectures can be&#xD; explored and verified before hardware is actually built. An&#xD; appropriate choice for the level of abstraction can reduce the&#xD; complexity and the time
                  required to create and simulate software&#xD; models.&#xD; &#xD; The first contribution of this thesis is a transaction-level&#xD; simulation model of a multithreaded multi-core
                  processor. The&#xD; transaction level is a high level of abstraction that hides&#xD; computational details from the designer allowing key architectural&#xD; elements to be quickly
                  explored. The processor model that has been&#xD; implemented for this thesis is flexible and can be used to explore&#xD; various designs by simulating different processor and
                  cache&#xD; configurations. The processor model is written in SystemC, which is&#xD; a standard design and verification language that is built on C++ and&#xD; that can be used to
                  model hardware systems.&#xD; &#xD; The second contribution of this thesis is the development of an&#xD; application model that seeks to characterize the behavior of&#xD; instruction
                  execution and data accesses in a program. An&#xD; application's instruction trace can be profiled to produce a model&#xD; that can be used to generate a synthetic trace with
                  similar&#xD; characteristics. The synthetic trace can then be used in place of&#xD; large trace files to drive the SystemC-based processor model. The&#xD; application model can also
                  produce various workload scenarios for&#xD; multiprocessor simulation.&#xD; &#xD; From experimentation, various processor configurations and different&#xD; workload scenarios were
                  simulated to explore the potential benefits&#xD; of a multi-core multithreaded processor architecture. Performance&#xD; increased with diminishing returns with additional
                  multi-core&#xD; multithreading support. However, these improvement were limited by&#xD; the utilization of the shared bus.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This study sought to understand the lived experience of disengagement from formal schooling of five young Aboriginal women in a mid-Northern community.&#xD; Using the
                  qualitative methodology of narrative inquiry, and through a series of guided open-ended interviews, this research explored each participant’s experiences as a learner; informally and
                  in school.&#xD; Analysis of the personal histories of learning shared by the participants enabled the identification of attributes of best-remembered learning experiences and also
                  elements that contributed to marginalization and dis-continuing of school.&#xD; Key elements for each learner clustered around relationship and connectedness. Contexts of optimal
                  learning as revealed in the narratives can be characterized as authentic, situated, experiential, guided, and often culturally-relevant. Marginalization and dis-continuing of school
                  were related to: a sense of emotional insecurity in the school, the need for community and a sense of belonging, disrespectful treatment and relational bullying by teachers and/or
                  peers, administrative policy related to placement and psycho-social needs, and restrictive curricular decisions. The participants’ desire to learn and continuing pursuit of learning
                  goals, although out of school, is expressed in the title of this thesis by Participant A as she speaks for all in saying, “I’m still learning” (PA#1, p. 3).&#xD; Recommendations for
                  formal schooling are made based on the needs and preferences expressed by the participants and by the institutional circumstances revealed in the narratives that affected engagement
                  and dis-engagement.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Transmission impairments degrade the quality of optical signals, ultimately limiting the achievable transmission distance. Optical 3R regenerators provide an effective
                  means of coping with transmission impairments by restoring the quality of optical signals through reamplification, reshaping, and retiming (3Rs), thereby enabling reliable
                  transmission over long distances. Beyond the 3Rs, however, regenerators must also be able to operate within the practical constraints of the network. The specific network of interest
                  in this thesis is referred to as an agile all-photonic network (AAPN).&#xD; &#xD; In AAPNs, traffic consists of optical packets that are routed through the core of the network
                  without undergoing optical-to-electrical conversion for signal processing (e.g., 3R regeneration). As a result, 3R regeneration must be performed all-optically, otherwise known as
                  all-optical 3R regeneration (AO-3R). Although a variety of AO-3R techniques have been demonstrated, none have been specifically designed to operate within the practical constraints
                  of AAPNs.&#xD; &#xD; In this thesis, a 10 Gb/s all-optical 3R regeneration (AO-3R) technique is proposed, specifically designed to operate within the practical constraints of AAPNs.
                  The technique performs AO-3R in a novel 2-stage design. In the first stage, all-optical retiming is achieved using a self-pulsating distributed feedback laser (SP-DFBL) for
                  all-optical clock recovery and cross-phase modulation (XPM) in highly nonlinear fiber (HNLF) with offset spectral slicing for the retiming. In the second stage, all-optical reshaping
                  (and reamplification) is achieved using self-phase modulation (SPM) in HNLF with offset spectral slicing.&#xD; &#xD; Experimental assessment of the AO-3R system performance yields
                  excellent results. In particular, AO-3R is shown to improve the performance of input signals degraded by transmission impairments, such as amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise,
                  while providing low sensitivity to input signal properties, such as the state-of-polarization. Furthermore, AO-3R is shown to successfully achieve its ultimate goal for AAPNs – the
                  regeneration of optical packets.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>We have acquired near-IR H and optical $g$,$r$,$i$,$z$ imaging for a sample of 299 Virgo cluster galaxies down to a limiting magnitude of B$_T$=16.0 mag. The low
                  sensitivity of near-IR wavelengths to dust extinction is crucial for an unbiased geometric deprojection of fundamental galaxy parameters. We find, in agreement with Tully and
                  Verheijen (1997), a clear dichotomy between high and low surface brightness galaxy disks. The difference between the low and high brightness peaks of Virgo galaxies is $\sim$2 H-mag
                  arcsec$^{-2}$, significantly larger than any systematic errors. The high surface brightness galaxies have two distinct classes of bulge with high and low concentration, while low
                  surface brightness galaxies have only low concentration bulges. The distribution of the effective surface brightnesses of our entire sample shows that early-type galaxies exhibit a
                  similar structural bimodality though offset from that of spiral galaxies towards higher surface brightnesses. We find that the structural bimodality is uncorrelated with colour or
                  any other structural parameter except, perhaps, the circular velocity. Simulations of realistic surface brightness profiles show that a bimodality in effective surface brightness is
                  unexpected based on normal distributions of fundamental bulge and disk parameters. Rather, the structural bimodality is likely linked to the galaxy dynamics, namely the specific
                  angular momentum of the galaxy; high surface brightness galaxies have low angular momentum and can collapse to form dynamically important disks, while low surface brightness galaxies
                  are dominated by the dark halo everywhere. Finally, our bulge-disk decompositions of all the sample galaxy images using various fitting functions have revealed that galaxies of all
                  morphologies, including flattened and spheroidal systems, exhibit a ``disk'' component which is best described by a generalized ``Sersic'' function. We also find that the majority of
                  galaxy disks show significant deviations from a pure exponential. Further dynamical studies of both cluster and field galaxies are needed to properly explain the observed structural
                  bimodality in both early- and late-type galaxies.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>In the absence of taxes and transactions costs, there can be no benefit to corporate reorganization from a financial standpoint, but ‘real world’ limitations and frictions
                  do provide additional value that is gained through divestitures in terms of focus and financial flexibility. Herein, the corporate divestiture decision is analyzed to determine the
                  motivation for a parent company either to cleave its offspring directly to the external capital market in an equity carve-out or to distribute the shares to the existing shareholders
                  in a tax-free spin-off. Cash flow performance, asymmetric information, relative size of the divestiture, and relatedness of the parent’s and subsidiary’s operations are all found to
                  contribute significantly to the divestiture decision. In Canada, an alternate form of security, known as the income trust unit, has become popular for corporate reorganizations,
                  either through an initial public offering or as a conversion of shares. The flow-through structure of income trusts currently allows avoidance of corporate taxation to offer higher
                  pre-tax returns to retail investors, in a market setting where yield is increasingly equated with value. To determine placement of these securities in the market, the risk of the
                  income trust organizational form is analyzed and compared to the standard corporate form. Further, a number of publicly known characteristics of the income trusts can predict the
                  relative risk of this type of investment. In recent ‘hot markets’ for these securities, proof is uncovered that unsuitable firms have been migrating to this sector, but valuation of
                  the investments in this sector has remained fair and full. Although pending legislation will discontinue the tax-exempt status of income trusts in 2011, during their tenure these
                  securities have improved the Canadian market. Based on the data analysis herein, all types of divestitures studied have been predicted to provide commensurate value with respect to
                  risk depending on the nature of the subsidiary.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis is a detailed, multi-waveband study of the inner 14 kpc of the famous spiral galaxy, NCG 891. The primary data have come from the Infrared Space Observatory's
                  Camera. These data are images of the galaxy in 9 different mid-infrared wavebands. We have supported these data with archived data from the Spitzer Infrared Array Camera in 4 similar
                  wavebands. Surface brightness contour maps of the galaxy were created and examined&#xD; to determine where the mid-infrared emitters are located with respect to the galactic plane.
                  We have determined that the main mid-infrared emission, due to warm dust and PAHs, lies in a thin disk of width 700 - 800 pc, but has faint emission that reaches up to about 2.3 kpc
                  into the halo.&#xD; &#xD; The infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) for four environments in NGC 891 were created from the above mentioned wavebands as well as measurements
                  from Spitzer's Multiband Imaging Photometer (3 Far-Infrared wavebands), the Two Micron All Sky Survey J, H, and K near-infrared wavebands, and the Sub-millimeter Common User
                  Bolometer Array 450 and 850 $\mu$m bands. These spectra were fit with a SED model created by Frederic Galliano, and the physical properties of these environments were computed. The
                  maps and SED show that while there is a relatively large amount of dust in NGC 891's halo, there is a depletion of PAHs beyond 2.3 kpc from the mid-plane. This is only the fourth
                  galaxy to date that has PAH emission discovered in the halo, and it is the first in which the SED has been modeled for the halo.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) is a cellular system that was standardized by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). HSDPA can support data rates of up to
                  14.4 Mbps through the use of a shared channel. Due to its high transmission rates, the highly popular multimedia applications are converging over this network. Moreover, as the
                  shared channel is assigned to a single user in a given time interval, the scheduling decision is considered as a crucial one. Conventional HSDPA scheduling schemes utilize the
                  fluctuations in channel condition to maximize system throughput by selecting users with relatively good radio conditions. However, this raises the issue of fairness as users with
                  relatively poor channel conditions might not be served and consequently may suffer from starvation. Furthermore, Real-Time (RT) applications have strict delay constraints and require
                  that packets are transmitted within a certain delay threshold. &#xD; &#xD; In this thesis, a Delay Based Scheduler (DBS) is proposed for HSDPA which aims at minimizing the average
                  queuing delay at the packet scheduler without compromising system throughput and fairness. In addition, the scheme can balance the tradeoff between throughput maximization and the
                  minimization of queuing delay through the attunement of a parameter, thus allowing the service provider to choose between these two metrics. The DBS maintains the delay constraints
                  of RT applications by defining delay thresholds for each traffic class and dropping packets that exceed their delay limit. The DBS accommodates Quality of Service (QoS)
                  prioritization by defining and utilizing desired QoS parameters in the scheduling assignment. Finally, it was mathematically shown that the DBS can converge to a Non-Real-Time (NRT)
                  scheme known as the Max CIR algorithm, allowing the scheduler to support RT and NRT applications simultaneously. The performance of the DBS was evaluated and compared to other well
                  known schemes. It was found that the DBS can minimize the aggregate queuing delay of the system and maintain similar throughput and fairness.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Distributed generation that utilizes 5-10kW Solid Oxide Fuel Cells requires power electronics to optimize the overall system efficiency while reducing the cost. The
                  Adaptive Energy Zero-Voltage-Switching Phase-Shift-Modulated Full-Bridge (AE-ZVS-PSM-FB) topology meets these criteria under all loading conditions, but suffers from complexity
                  associated with an analog control implementation. This thesis presents a novel Look-Up-Table (LUT) based digital controller required for such converter. The applied design approach
                  also reduces the design time and controller requirements, which in turn decreases the overall system cost.&#xD; Steady-state analysis for the AE-ZVS-PSM-FB converter is performed
                  using a piece-wise equivalent circuit model. This analysis is used to verify the LUT concept that forms the basis for the proposed LUT-based digital controller. The proposed
                  LUT-based digital control algorithm is developed and verified using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) Logic platform. Design procedures and operational function under steady state
                  and step change conditions are presented.&#xD; Simulation results demonstrate the LUT concept in the AE-ZVS-PSM-FB converter, and the simplicity of the proposed LUT-based digital
                  controller in producing the expected switching sequence. Simulation results were also produced showing successful dynamic response of LUT-based digital controller interconnected with
                  the converter under different operating conditions. A Xilinx FPGA demonstration board was used to generate experimental switching sequence results to demonstrate the simplicity of
                  the proposed controller.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Emerging processor technologies are becoming commercially available that make multi-processor capabilities affordable for use in a large number of computer systems.
                  Increasing power consumption by this next generation of processors is a growing concern as the cost of operating such systems continues to increase. &#xD; It is important to
                  understand the characteristics of these emerging technologies in order to enhance their performance. By understanding the characteristics of high performance computing workloads on
                  real systems, the overall efficiency with which such workloads are executed can be increased. In addition, it is important to determine the best trade-off between system performance
                  and power consumption using the variety of system configurations that are possible with these new technologies.&#xD; This thesis seeks to provide a comprehensive presentation of the
                  performance characteristics of several real commercially available simultaneous-multithreading multi-processor architectures and provide recommendations to improve overall system
                  performance. As well, it will provide solutions to reduce the power consumption of such systems while minimizing the performance impact of these techniques on the system.&#xD; The

      <dcterms:abstract>An increase in blood flow associated shear stress results in an endothelial dependent increase in vessel diameter (flow mediated vasodilation (FMD)). Assessment of FMD can
                  provide an index of endothelial function. The stimulus profiles that have been used to investigate FMD in human conduit arteries fall into two categories: reactive hyperemia and
                  sustained stimuli. Stimulus-response specificity proposes that the stimulus characteristics (e.g. magnitude, pattern) are essential determinants of the response characteristics (e.g.
                  magnitude, mechanisms). Purpose: To investigate four specific aspects of FMD stimulus-response specificity: 1) The relative importance of the peak vs. the duration of reactive
                  hyperemia in determining FMD response magnitude. 2) The nitric oxide (NO) dependence of FMD following different durations of reactive hyperemia. 3) The impact of sustained shear
                  stress stimulus magnitude on FMD response dynamics and magnitude. 4) FMD dynamics and magnitude in response to steady vs. oscillatory shear stress evoked passively or via exercise.
                  Methods: Doppler ultrasound was applied to the brachial or radial artery to measure blood flow velocity. Vessel diameter was measured with automated edge detection software. Shear
                  rate, an estimate of shear stress was calculated as the blood flow velocity/vessel diameter. Results: 1) The duration of reactive hyperemia is an important determinant of peak FMD
                  magnitude while the independent contribution of the peak shear to FMD is minimal. 2) NO is not obligatory to FMD following either a five or a ten minute duration occlusion. 3) FMD in
                  response to a sustained stimulus is characterized by a generally bi-phasic response with a fast first phase followed by a slower final phase. 4) The endothelium transduces the mean
                  shear stress when it is exposed passive or handgrip exercise induced oscillations in shear stress. Conclusions: The results indicate that future reactive hyperemia studies must
                  account for the stimulus duration when interpreting FMD results. Further, they demonstrate that the role of NO in FMD is unclear and caution against oversimplified conceptual models
                  of FMD mechanisms. FMD in response to sustained stimuli provides information distinct from reactive hyperemia investigations and exercise may provide a valuable stimulus creation
                  technique.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This dissertation explores how Venetians used the figurative arts as a means of responding to and shaping their experience of the War of the League of Cambrai (1509–17).
                  The war was the most politically and spiritually tumultuous conflict in Venice’s history and almost resulted in the loss of its mainland empire. To provide a sense of the complexity
                  of the relationship between art and contemporary military events, the study gathers and analyses a wide range of works, from painting and sculpture to woodcuts for books and prints.
                  Chapters two, three, and four investigate how Venetians used visual art to represent and interpret their struggle to reclaim the former terraferma empire. Chapter two begins the
                  discussion by examining the modest woodcuts accompanying printed propagandistic texts that were inspired by the battle for the mainland and that constitute the first visual response
                  to the war. Chapter three explores the interpretation afforded military events by subsequent and more enduring works of art, particularly sculpted altarpieces and tombs for
                  mercenaries. Chapter four discusses the assertive revival of more traditional visual themes, particularly the lion of St. Mark. Chapters five, six, and seven, in contrast, address
                  how Venetian art reflects the atmosphere of spiritual crisis generated by the popular interpretation of the war as a form of divine punishment. The first of these demonstrates how
                  devotional books responded to the unsettled mood through text and image. Chapter six proposes that the wartime popularity of multi-block woodcuts, particularly of religious subjects,
                  similarly reflects a market for certain kinds of devotional imagery. To conclude, chapter seven argues that the same atmosphere sparked a sudden interest during the war and shortly
                  thereafter in paintings of Christ and the adulteress. Considered as a group, the studies presented by the various chapters demonstrate that Venetians produced a wide variety of art
                  during the Cambrai War as a means of interpreting the conflict’s significance and influencing its course.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Retinoic acid (RA) is an active metabolite of vitamin A that is essential for embryonic development, and homeostasis of adult tissues. RA is a ligand for the nuclear
                  retinoic acid receptor, and RA-mediated signaling is critical for regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. There is a spatio-temporal distribution of RA in
                  the developing embryo such that some tissues are rich in RA, while others are devoid. This patterned distribution of RA is tightly controlled through the coordinated expression of
                  RA-synthesizing (retinaldehyde dehydrogenase) and RA-catabolizing (CYP26) enzymes. In this thesis, I describe the cloning of a mouse gene encoding one of the CYP26 proteins, Cyp26b1.
                  Cyp26b1 was shown to be highly expressed in the embryo, with transcripts localized to the hindbrain, limb buds and branchial arches. We also used homologous recombination to generate
                  a line of transgenic mice with a loss-of-function deletion in Cyp26b1. These mice die shortly after birth with severe malformations affecting the limbs, craniofacial structures and
                  epidermis; phenotypes that are all reminiscent of RA teratogenesis. We present an extensive characterization of the craniofacial and epidermal abnormalities in Cyp26b1-/- animals,
                  and examine several molecular pathways that may be deregulated. CYP26B1 null embryos exhibit a truncated mandible, lack numerous facial bones, and show reduced ossification of the
                  calvaria. Molecular analysis of Cyp26b1-/- embryos indicates hindbrain and branchial arch patterning is largely unaffected in early to mid-gestational mutants. However, there appear
                  to be some subtle abnormalities in neural crest cell migration, which may contribute to the development of some of the observed phenotypes. CYP26B1 null mutants also lack hair
                  follicles, which appears to be due to a downregulation of -catenin mediated signaling. Thus, in addition to cloning and characterizing the expression of murine Cyp26b1, we have
                  demonstrated in vivo, that regulation of RA distribution by CYP26B1 is essential for morphogenesis of the epidermis and craniofacial structures.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The population of all magnetic chemically peculiar stars (Ap stars) within 100 parsecs of the sun has been identified and investigated, determining fundamental parameters,
                  rotational properties, and magnetic field characteristics.&#xD; &#xD; Using the HIPPARCOS Catalogue all intermediate mass stars within 100 pc of the sun have been identified. From
                  published catalogues and other literature sources, we have identified 57 bona fide magnetic Ap/Bp stars in this distance-selected sample. Effective temperature, luminosity, radius,
                  and mass were determined for each of the sample stars using published photometry and photometric calibrations, energy distributions, and HIPPARCOS parallaxes. Using the MuSiCoS
                  spectropolarimeter at the Pic du Midi Observatory and the Least Squares Deconvolution procedure, Stokes I and V profiles were obtained for 26 of the 57 Ap sample stars. These
                  observations were used in combination with previously published data to refine rotation periods, to determine projected rotational velocities, and to determine magnetic field
                  strengths and geometries.&#xD; &#xD; Using the mass statistics of the sample Ap and non-Ap stars, the mass incidence distribution of magnetic intermediate mass stars in the solar
                  neighbourhood has been derived. The Ap stars make up 1.7 to 2.8% (57 Ap stars out of 3904 intermediate mass stars) of all intermediate mass stars within 100 parsecs of the sun, and
                  appear uniformly distributed across the main sequence. Statistical distributions of various properties, including distributions of the surface dipole field strength, rotational axis
                  inclination, magnetic obliquity angle, and rotational period were analyzed. The rotation period distribution peaks at $2.1\pm1.1$ days, and displays an extended tail to very long
                  periods. The majority of Ap stars in the sample have rotational velocities below 70 km/s, although some exhibit v sin i as large as 169 km/s. The histogram of obliquity angles shows
                  a bimodal distribution, with a strong preference for beta angles near 0 and 90 degrees. The derived distribution of inclination angles agrees with that found by Abt (2001) for
                  randomly-oriented rotation axes. The distribution of surface dipole field strengths exhibits a plateau at 2.5+/-0.5 kG, dropping off to higher and lower field strengths. The results
                  obtained agree with those obtained by Auriere et al. (2007), who reported a lower surface field limit at 300 G, proposing a lower limit critical field strength necessary for stable
                  magnetic configurations to exist.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Multiple description coding (MDC) has received a lot of attention recently,&#xD; and has been studied widely and extended to many demanding applications such&#xD; as speech
                  and video. MDC is a coding technique that generates correlated&#xD; descriptions of the source stream for transmitting over a diversity system&#xD; with several channels. The
                  objective of this diversity system is to overcome&#xD; channel impairments and provide more reliability. In the context of lossy&#xD; source coding and quantization, a multiple
                  description quantization system&#xD; usually consists of multiple channels, side encoders to quantize the source&#xD; samples and send over different channels, and side and central
                  decoders to&#xD; reconstruct the source.&#xD; &#xD; We propose two multiple description quantization schemes in&#xD; order to design the codebooks and partitions of side and central
                  quantizers&#xD; of a multiple description system with two channels. The applied framework&#xD; originated in the multiple description quantization via Gram-Schmidt&#xD;
                  orthogonalization approach. The basic idea of our proposed schemes is to&#xD; minimize a Lagrangian cost function by an iterative technique which jointly&#xD; designs side codebooks
                  and partitions. Our proposed methods perform very&#xD; closely to the optimum MD quantizer with considerably less complexity.&#xD; &#xD; We also propose a multiple description video
                  coding technique motivated by&#xD; human visual perception. We employ two simple parameters as a measure of the&#xD; perceptual tolerance of discrete cosine transform (DCT) blocks
                  against&#xD; visual distortion. We duplicate the essential information such as motion&#xD; vectors and some low-frequency DCT coefficients of prediction errors into&#xD; each

      <dcterms:abstract>This case study investigated the polyphonic discourse in a beginning secondary school mathematics classroom in Trinidad. It relates how classroom and research interview
                  ‘talk’ contributed to students’, their teacher’s and the researcher’s developing conceptions of mathematics, themselves and each other. The study is approached from dialogical and
                  socio-constructivist orientations.&#xD; Students and their teacher professed a diverse set of prior conceptions of&#xD; mathematics which included viewing mathematics as rule based
                  with a problem solving orientation and emphasizing attention to the teacher. Several cases are reported that describe the authoritative elements which included a well defined
                  structure to lessons mirroring the textbook, ‘cloze’ questions, and a reliance on rules and absent historical referents as justifications for mathematical activities and substitution
                  for mathematical reasoning. Student and teacher questions and their desire to understand, however, served to interrupt the monological discourse. What was internally persuasive for
                  students was the relational competency of their teacher as well as the communicative acts of their peers. Students’ responses to pedagogy were internally persuasive for the teacher
                  and precipitated ideological assessment. Both discourse types contributed to the formation of individual as well as social identities. Student and teacher utterances were internally
                  persuasive for the researcher. &#xD; I recommend that research needs to attend more meaningfully to what is internally&#xD; persuasive for students and teachers in mathematics
                  teaching and learning. In addition I theorize on the need for a dialogical relationship between dialogue and pedagogy that is attentive to the ambiguities in
                  communication.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Early Permian (Sakmarian to Kungarian) Raanes and Great Bear Cape formations of the Sverdrup Basin were deposited at a time of ocean cooling, and are interpreted to
                  reflect a subtropical setting. Pelmatozoans, bryozoans, and brachiopods are the predominant fossils throughout the extent of these two units, with local occurrences of large
                  fusulinids and colonial corals. This mixed photozoan-heterozoan assemblage is similar to the sediments of modern-day subtropical settings. Although the Raanes and Great Bear Cape
                  have warm-water rocks below, and cool-water rocks above, the fossil assemblages in these formations were dependent upon changes in oceanography and sea-level. Three distinct phases,
                  as determined by water depth and temperature, occur. First, the rocks of the Raanes and lower Great Bear Cape are deep water and heterozoan in nature. Second, the middle Great Bear
                  Cape limestones record a time of shallow, subtropical waters. Finally, the upper Great Bear Cape is shallow-water, but cooling had progressed to a point that precluded the occurrence
                  of any photozoan components, regardless of depth. Due to evolutionary changes in other subtropical biota, the most reliable fossil indicator of subtropical deposition in the rock
                  record is large benthic foraminifera (including fusulinids) in an otherwise heterozoan assemblage. The identification of limestones representative of these conditions should,
                  therefore, be identifiable at times in the Earth’s history when large benthic foraminifera lived in shallow marine environments. &#xD; The Great Bear Cape Formation subtropical
                  facies underwent post-depositional changes that are manifest as calcite cements, iron-oxides, glauconite, and silica. Isopachous calcite cements precipitated in intraskeletal pore
                  spaces as well as around the outside of grains. Glauconite, which is an authigenic marine mineral, has been oxidized to iron oxide, and both minerals post-date, or are included
                  within, the isopachous cements. The isopachous cements must, therefore, have also formed in the marine environment. Where they are precipitated around pelmatozoan fragments, these
                  originally high magnesium calcite cements have been neomorphosed to single-crystal epitaxial cements at the same time as mineral stabilization of the biofragments. These cements then
                  seeded the growth of further epitaxial cement in the meteoric environment.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Most coding schemes used in today's communication systems are designed for memoryless channels. These codes break down when they are transmitted over channels&#xD; with
                  memory, which is in fact what real-world channels look like since errors often&#xD; occur in bursts. Therefore, these systems employ interleaving to spread the errors so&#xD; that
                  the channel looks more or less memoryless (for the decoder) at the cost of added delay and complexity. In addition, they fail to exploit the memory of the channel which increases the
                  capacity for a wide class of channels. On the other hand, most channels with memory do not have simple and mathematically tractable models, making the design of suitable channel
                  codes more challenging and possibly not practical.&#xD; Recently, a new model has been proposed known as the queue-based channel (QBC)&#xD; which is simple enough for mathematical
                  analysis and complex enough for modeling&#xD; wireless fading channels.&#xD; In this work, we examine the performance of linear block codes when transmitted&#xD; over this channel.
                  We break down our focus into two parts. First, we investigate the&#xD; maximum likelihood decoding of binary linear block codes over the QBC. Since it&#xD; is well known that for
                  binary symmetric memoryless channels, maximum likelihood&#xD; decoding reduces to minimum Hamming distance decoding, our objective here is to&#xD; explore whether there exists a
                  similar relation between these two decoding schemes&#xD; when the channel does have memory. We give a partial answer for the case of perfect&#xD; and quasi perfect codes.&#xD; Next,
                  we study Reed-Solomon (RS) codes and analyze their performance when transmitted over the QBC under the assumption of bounded distance decoding. In particular, we examine the two
                  interleaving strategies encountered when dealing with non-binary codes over a binary input channel; namely, symbol interleaving and bit interleaving. We compare these two
                  interleaving schemes analytically and show that symbol interleaving always outperforms bit interleaving. Non-interleaved Reed-Solomon&#xD; codes are also covered. We derive some
                  useful expressions pertaining to the calculation of the probability of codeword error. The performance of non-interleaved RS codes are compared to that of interleaved ones for the
                  simplest scenario of the QBC which is the additive (first-order) Markov noise channel with non-negative noise correlation.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are widely regarded as a major threat to the Internet. A flooding-based DDoS attack is a very common way to attack a victim
                  machine by sending a large number of malicious traffic. In this thesis, we propose a distance-based distributed DDoS defense framework which defends against attacks by coordinating
                  between the distance-based DDoS defense systems of the source ends and the victim end. The proposed defense system has three major components: detection, traceback, and response. In
                  the detection component, two distance-based detection techniques are employed. First, a distance-based technique is used to detect attacks based on a distance statistical model.
                  Second, a statistical traffic rate forecasting technique is applied to identify attack traffic within the traffic, that are separated based on distance to the victim-end network. For
                  the traceback component, the existing Fast Internet Traceback (FIT) technique is employed to find remote edge routers which forward attack traffic to the victim. In the response
                  component, the distance-based rate limit mechanism quickly lowers attack traffic by setting up rate limits on these routers. We evaluate the distance-based DDoS defense system on a
                  network simulation platform called NS2. The results demonstrate that both detection techniques are capable of detecting flooding-based DDoS attacks, and the defense system can
                  effectively control attack traffic to sustain quality of service for legitimate users. Moreover, the system shows better performance in defeating flooding-based DDoS attacks compared
                  to the pushback technique which uses a local aggregate congestion control mechanism.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Fps/Fes and Fer are members of a distinct subfamily of cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases that have recently been implicated in the regulation of innate immunity.
                  Previous studies showed that mice lacking Fps/Fes are hyper-sensitive to systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. This study identifies physiological, cellular and molecular
                  defects that contribute to the hyper-inflammatory phenotype in Fps/Fes-null mice. We showed that plasma tumour necrosis factor (TNF) - levels were elevated in LPS challenged
                  Fps/Fes-null mice as compared to wild type mice, and cultured Fps/Fes-null peritoneal macrophages treated with LPS showed increased TNF- production. Cultured Fps/Fes-null
                  macrophages also displayed prolonged LPS-induced degradation of IB-, increased phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-B, and defective TLR4 internalization. Next, we showed a
                  role for Fps in the regulation of recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes. Using the cremaster muscle intravital microscopy model, we observed increased leukocyte adherence to
                  venules, and increased rates and degrees of transendothelial migration in Fps/Fes-null mice, compared to wild type. There was also increased neutrophil migration into the peritoneal
                  cavity subsequent to thioglycollate challenge. Using flow cytometry, we observed prolonged expression of the selectin ligand PSGL-1 on peripheral blood neutrophils from
                  Fps/Fes-knockout mice stimulated ex-vivo with LPS. Finally, we examined the role of Fps/Fes in regulating apoptosis in response to inflammation. Upon intra-peritoneal challenge with
                  LPS, Fps/Fes-null mice displayed a decreased depletion of macrophages from the peritoneal cavity. In response to ex-vivo TNF- stimulation, macrophages from Fps/Fes-null mice
                  underwent decreased apoptosis and necrosis as assessed by flow cytometry. Immunoblot analysis revealed that Fps/Fes-null macrophages displayed more TNF--induced degradation of IB-α
                  in Fps/Fes-null cells, with corresponding increases in the phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-B. In addition, stimulation of macrophages with TNF-α up-regulated PARP
                  expression in wild-type macrophages; this up-regulation was not observed in Fps/Fes-null macrophages. Finally we observed a decreased recruitment of macrophages to the peritoneal
                  cavities of Fps/Fes-null mice, with a corresponding increase in neutrophil recruitment, 5 days after thioglycollate challenge. Overall, we show that there is a role for Fps/Fes in
                  regulating inflammation at the physiological, cellular, and molecular levels, and that this might be relevant in inflammatory disease.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Canadian education has historical roots in blatantly assimilationist policies bent on the social, economic, linguistic and spiritual subjugation of Aboriginal peoples and
                  their cultures. Today, Canadian education has moved away from overtly colonialist discourses and publicly embraced the principles of multiculturalism. This research explores how and
                  if this ideological shift has translated into the practice of contemporary Canadian education as it is experienced by students. My research focuses on the ways Canada’s colonial
                  history and contemporary Aboriginal issues are addressed in mandatory Ontario high school social studies curriculum. This analysis is based on interviews with twenty-five recent high
                  school graduates about what they remember learning about Aboriginal issues and how that knowledge has influenced their understanding of colonialism and Aboriginal peoples today. My
                  interpretive analysis of students’ responses relies on the insights provided by critical pedagogy and postcolonial theory. By drawing on Gramsci, Freire and Apple I challenge the
                  hegemonic practices in education that continue to marginalize Aboriginal peoples and their struggles. This research contributes to scholarship in the sociology of education and
                  postcolonial studies by providing a unique picture of the ways in which young people come to understand Canada’s colonial legacy through their formal education, as well as providing
                  insight into new directions for curriculum development, teacher training and more effective integration of anti-racist pedagogy in Ontario’s high schools.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>BACKGROUND: Radical prostatectomy is the surgical procedure performed on men with clinically localized prostate cancer. In recent years, radical prostatectomy quality
                  indicators have been recommended, but the feasibility and validity for many of these listed surgical quality indicators have yet to be examined. We tested the convergent construct
                  validity of these quality indicators by assessing their associations with hospital volume, a variable repeatedly associated with the quality of surgical care, for prostate cancer
                  patients treated with radical prostatectomy. OBJECTIVES: (1) To assess variations in quality indicators by hospital volume; and (2) To investigate whether certain explanatory
                  variables account for some of the variation observed in Objective 1. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study using medical chart review data that had already been collected as
                  part of a parent study. The study population consisted of a stratified random sample of prostate cancer patients diagnosed between 1990 and 1998 in Ontario, who were treated by
                  radical prostatectomy with curative intent within six months of diagnosis (n = 645). The feasibility of using this data to assess a number of quality indicators was explored, and
                  where possible, variables were developed for analysis. Ultimately, detailed analyses were performed for the quality indicators: total blood transfusions of three units or greater,
                  length of hospital stay, and use of non-nerve-sparing surgical technique. RESULTS: Even using high-quality chart data, it was not feasible to evaluate all of the quality indicators
                  that were explored. For blood transfusions of three units or greater, length of hospital stay, and use of non-nerve-sparing surgical technique, worse outcomes were generally apparent
                  with decreasing hospital volume, both before and after adjusting for the effect of explanatory variables. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated convergent construct validity for three quality
                  indicators (blood transfusions, length of hospital stay, and non-nerve-sparing surgery). If their validity is further demonstrated in future studies, these indicators could be used
                  for quality assessment and could provide feedback to surgeons, surgical department heads, hospital administrators, and quality councils by suggesting areas for quality improvement in
                  surgical care, such that future outcomes can be optimized.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: The growing population of older adults with intellectual disabilities is likely to experience secondary disabilities that affect well-being. Despite the
                  established importance of mobility in the general population, there is little evidence of a scientific base on mobility limitations for people with intellectual disabilities.&#xD;
                  Objectives: The aim of this study was to better understand mobility limitations in adults with intellectual disabilities, age 45 and over, by describing the prevalence and severity
                  of mobility limitations and determining the association with living in a high support setting.&#xD; Methods: A systematic review of published literature on mobility limitations among
                  adults with intellectual disabilities was conducted using a pre-determined search and extraction strategies. A cross-sectional study was then conducted among a representative sample
                  of adults, age 45 and over with intellectual disabilities in South Eastern Ontario. Data was collected through standardized proxy response telephone surveys and analyzed
                  descriptively to determine the prevalence and severity of mobility limitations in this population. A multivariate logistic regression model was then used to examine the association
                  between mobility limitations and residential status.&#xD; Results: The systematic review identified 32 publications that met all inclusion criteria. Publications were generally not
                  focused on mobility, cross-sectional in design and few investigators addressed key methodological features in their report. Original data was collected for 128 older adults with
                  intellectual disabilities. The prevalence of mobility limitations varied according to the definition employed. Using comparable definitions, this prevalence was higher than what is
                  seen in the general Canadian population. The prevalence of mobility limitations was not found to increase with age but was greater in females than males. People with intellectual
                  disabilities and mobility limitations had 3.6 times greater odds of living in high support residential settings than those without mobility limitations. This difference was
                  statistically significant. &#xD; Conclusion: Past epidemiological research on mobility limitations for people with intellectual disabilities is of poor quality. In addressing these
                  limitations, this study found that mobility limitations are common among people with intellectual disabilities and are associated with meaningful outcomes, such as the place in which
                  a person lives.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This qualitative case study was conducted to learn about the experiences of one language-minority student learning French in a core French class in Eastern Ontario.
                  In-class observations and interviews with the language-minority learner (LML), his guardian, his teachers and principal were conducted over a six-week period. The data collected
                  helped to create a thick description of the LML’s experiences. The results of the study show that the institution, family and friends all play a role in the LML’s experiences in
                  learning French. It was found that the use and availability of resources, possible curriculum modifications, and effective teaching and learning strategies for language-minority
                  students are important factors affecting the experiences of the LML. This study shows that peers have a strong influence on the experiences of the LML in learning French in the core
                  French context. Finally, the Canadian School Stay program came under scrutiny and information was gleaned from the regional coordinator. Suggestions are made for improved content

      <dcterms:abstract>Computation with large-scale heterogeneous data typically requires universal traversal to search for all occurrences of a substructure that matches a possibly complex
                  search pattern, whose context may be different in different places within the data. Both aspects cause difficulty for existing general-purpose programming languages, because these
                  languages are designed for homogeneous data and have problems typing the different substructures in heterogeneous data, and the complex patterns to match with the substructures.
                  Programmers either have to hard-code the structures and search patterns, preventing programs from being reusable and scalable, or&#xD; have to use low-level untyped programming or
                  programming with special-purpose query languages, opening the door to type mismatches that cause a high risk of program correctness and security problems.&#xD; &#xD; This thesis
                  invents the concept of pattern structures, and proposes a general solution to the above problems - a programming technique using pattern structures. In this solution, well-typed
                  pattern structures are&#xD; defined to represent complex search patterns, and pattern searching over heterogeneous data is programmed with pattern parameters, in a statically-typed
                  language that supports first-class typing of structures and patterns. The resulting programs are statically-typed, highly reusable for different data structures and different
                  patterns, and highly scalable&#xD; in terms of the complexity of data structures and patterns. Adding new kinds of patterns for an application no longer requires changing the
                  language in use or creating new ones, but is only a programming task. The thesis demonstrates the application of this approach to, and its&#xD; advantages in, two important examples
                  of computation with heterogeneous data, i.e., XML data processing and Java bytecode analysis.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This thesis examines the complex intersections between Derek Walcott’s Omeros and modernist versions of the epic. Critics generally acknowledge the pervasive presence of
                  modernist allusions in Walcott’s early work, but see the relevance of modernism diminishing as Walcott develops his “mature” poetic strategies of mimicry and hybridity. I challenge
                  this reading of Walcott, arguing that the modernist practices of Ezra Pound in The Cantos, T.S. Eliot in The Waste Land, and Hart Crane in The Bridge are crucial to illuminating the
                  central theme of cultural healing in Walcott’s most ambitious work, Omeros. These four authors share the goal of creating an epic poem that encapsulates the experiences of modernity
                  (the modern epic). Walcott adopts and transforms elements from The Cantos, The Waste Land and The Bridge in order to articulate the complex relations among self, tradition, land, and
                  language that can allow the postcolonial subject to overcome the traumatic legacy of imperialism in the Caribbean. I define the relation between Omeros and its modernist intertexts
                  according to this pattern of imitation and divergence (which Joseph Farrell calls the pattern of imitatio and aemulatio in the epic tradition).&#xD; I organize my dissertation into
                  four chapters, each focused on a particular issue: the process of redefining the epic, the construction of indigenous status by means of myth and imperialism, the search for
                  alternative modes of understanding the past that would resist the hegemony of chronological history, and the mystical process of cultural healing that synthesizes the human, the
                  divine, and the natural world. This study demonstrates the tremendous utility and ideological ambiguities generated by the specific practices of&#xD; ii&#xD; literary modernism when
                  Walcott deploys them to articulate his cultural vision. My approach to Omeros provides a corrective to the critical tendency to view modernism in the postcolonial milieu as either
                  the postcolonial artist’s response to the conditions of modernity or as a tradition whose form and meaning is radically transformed by a postcolonial vision. Walcott’s relation to
                  modernism suggests that this postcolonial cultural vision is itself shaped by modernist poetics in ways that both empower and constrain.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>For young infants, knowledge of physical objects and animate agents seems highly rigid, with no information combined across domains. Adult cognition, however, is more
                  flexible. In this thesis, I use a special category of object—a tool—that can only be reasoned about appropriately if information is combined across domains. Using this special case,
                  I examine whether older infants are capable of integrating functional information about the tool while making inferences about the intent of the tool-user. Experiment 1 shows that
                  infants can reason about complex means-end sequences involving tools; and Experiments 2 and 3 both show that under some circumstances, infants can take into account functional
                  information about the tool when making these sorts of inferences. Together, these studies extend previous findings about how infants understand complex means-end sequences, and
                  demonstrate that by 13 months, infants are already combining knowledge across domains.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The Ontario Tories' 42-year hegemony in government (1943-1985) was wrought through clever policies which often utilized Crown institutions to promote prosperity or to
                  oblige or mollify vying interests. Ousted in 1985, though, they used their time in opposition to revise the Tory doctrine. In the 1995 election, the Tories emerged a tougher, more
                  truculent group quite unlike their predecessors. Campaigning on their Common Sense Revolution (CSR) platform, they promised to eliminate red tape and vowed to obliterate all
                  ostensible economic barriers which were impeding commerce in the province. In the CSR, the Tories identified Ontario Hydro (OH), the province's lauded publicly-owned power monopoly,
                  as a troublesome and inefficient Crown entity which required fundamental reform. Portions of OH, they hinted, would likely be sold. Once elected, the Tories worked hurriedly to
                  demolish OH and destroy public power in Ontario. &#xD; For nearly 100 years, OH proved a pivotal component within the province's political economy for its provision of affordable,
                  reliable power and its function as a policy tool to incite and direct development. A Tory government fought to instigate public power in the early 1900s and, in the late 1900s, a
                  Tory government was fighting vigorously to rescind it. Why would they now renounce Crown power?&#xD; It is the intent of this thesis to elucidate the Tory government's involvement in
                  the transformation of Ontario's electricity industry from 1995 to 2003. Distinguishing electricity as a special, strategic staple, this thesis uses a pro-state, pro-staples industry
                  political economy approach to discern how and why the Tory government sought to restructure the electricity sector. Essentially, it posits that the onslaught of neoliberalism, the
                  emergence of novel generating technology, and the faltering of OH's nuclear wing all had a huge part to play in provoking the Tory government to initiate its reforms. Their reforms,
                  though, proved too hasty, haughty, and fraught with ambiguity to work properly. While their open, competitive power market and attempts to privatize Hydro One failed horribly, the
                  Tories' energy re-regulation strategy did hold promise to allow the state to retain a prominent role in the power industry.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Although the donor portrait was extremely popular throughout Europe and mainland Italy during the late Middle Ages, the few art historians who have addressed the subject
                  have concluded that the motif was not popular in fourteenth-century Venice. The political structures of Venice and its citizens’ supposedly innate abhorrence of public expressions of
                  individuality in the Republic are often cited as reasons for the absence of individual donor portraits; the examples that have survived are commonly interpreted as direct reflections
                  of state or communal values. &#xD; This dissertation challenges these previous conclusions and poses the following questions: Was donor portraiture popular in Venice, and in what
                  forms? And how did the appearance and function of donor portraits in Venice compare with those from Europe and Byzantium? The evidence examined here includes a catalogue of 83
                  examples dated approximately between 1280 and 1413. I have attempted to reconstruct the social, political, and physical environments for these examples, and for those images that
                  have been lost through centuries of changing trends and political upheaval. Through case studies of donor portrait subjects from a cross-section of Venetian society, including doges,
                  nobles, cittadini, confraternity groups, and patrician women, it becomes clear that such images were, in fact, popular in late medieval Venice and that they were mostly intended for
                  public viewing. Furthermore, the fact that donor portraits are rarely mentioned in the extant documents suggests that such imagery was considered conventional and that it posed no
                  significant threat to the ideology of the Venetian state.&#xD; Further examination of these visual documents, and analyses of socio-historical developments in the period indicate
                  that donor portraits in Venice, like similar portraits in Byzantium and mainland Italy, mainly reflect personal concerns about family, status, wealth, and salvation. Their physical
                  appearance likewise suggests that these images were intended for display within the confines of city parishes and that ultimately, in this context, donor portraiture in late medieval
                  Venice was no more likely to reflect state ideologies than donor portraiture in other parts of Europe.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Studying the winter ecology of freshwater fishes has been a focus of much past and present research. Because of obvious constraints with studying fish in situ during the
                  winter, few studies have made links between laboratory findings and observations made in the natural environment. Recently, new developments in biotelemetry have provided a way of
                  assessing the winter ecology of fish in a natural setting. At present, however, there are few, if any, studies that attempt to make direct links between field and laboratory
                  results.&#xD; This research focuses on the reaction of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) to winter conditions using both biotelemetry and laboratory components. In the first
                  part of the study, biotelemetry-derived swimming activity is assessed across a range of temperatures (4.0-25°C). As well, swim tunnel-derived Ucrit swimming speeds and burst swimming
                  ability across similar temperatures were evaluated. In both cases, swimming activity and speeds decreased as temperatures decreased. In biotelemetry-derived measurements, swimming
                  activities increase late in winter, possibly suggesting acclimatization. &#xD; In the second part of the study the effect of hypoxia on winter habitat selection was investigated.
                  Biotelemetry-obtained locations of largemouth bass were compared to the distribution of dissolved oxygen throughout the lake at numerous times throughout the winter. In addition,
                  experiments were conducted in a laboratory setting on winter juvenile fish to determine the behavioural and physiological impacts of hypoxia. The results of these experiments
                  revealed a behavioural response in the lab and habitat avoidance in the field at an environmental oxygen level of approximately 2 mg/L of dissolved oxygen. &#xD; The combination of
                  biotelemetry with laboratory data has demonstrated that more informative results about the winter ecology of freshwater fishes can be derived. In the future, usefulness of this
                  combined approach in assessing the impacts of climate change on fish populations will be invaluable.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Urbanization and the globalization of the food system are causing social, environmental, economic and political problems worldwide. Rapid urbanization is increasing
                  environmental degradation and food insecurity. Urban agriculture is one tool for sustainable development that has the potential to provide food or related services within or on the
                  edges of urban areas. The goal of this research was to determine the current situation and the future potential of urban agriculture in Kingston. A literature review, questionnaires,
                  interviews and case studies were used to determine the perceptions of relevant stakeholders, barriers and ways to overcome those barriers. Conservative estimates of urban
                  agriculture's value to Kingston's environmental, social, community health, food security and economic dimensions were made through modeling. Study participants demonstrated a
                  relatively greater awareness of environmental and community benefits of urban agriculture compared to food security, health or economic benefits. Modeling and calculations indicated
                  that urban agriculture could contribute at least $190 to $860 million per year in positive environmental, health and economic benefits. Modeling indicated that sourcing more local
                  urban produced foods could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 1300 to 14000 tonnes annually for 39 common fresh fruits and vegetables. Urban agriculture could meet the fresh
                  fruits and vegetables needs of up to 76% or more of the Kingston CMA population. There appeared to be 5600 ha of area in the inner-city that could be used for food production. Major
                  challenges identified were perceptions of limited space, limited resources and education. Recommendations to address these challenges are also provided. Overall, urban agriculture
                  has potential to contribute to sustainability in Kingston.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A successful transition into kindergarten is of the utmost importance, as it marks the beginning of formal education and paves the way for future academic and social
                  outcomes. The transition into school is considered to be a challenging and anxiety-ridden time for most children and their parents; it is expected therefore, to be particularly
                  difficult for children with an intellectual disability (ID). These children have deficits in cognitive and adaptive functioning that affect their academic and social skills. Despite
                  the apparent difficulty for children with ID and the importance of this time in their lives, the transition into school has been a relatively under-researched topic.&#xD; Nineteen
                  parents of children with ID participated in three one-hour phone interviews throughout the transition into school. The aims of the study were 1) to describe this group of children
                  with ID and their families as the children entered school, 2) to investigate changes in characteristics of the child, resources, and perceptions of the parent during the transition,
                  and 3) to examine relationships between these variables and the child’s quality of life and school readiness. Although the results are based on a small sample, they do provide some
                  preliminary information about the experiences of children with ID and their families throughout the transition into school. Only adaptive behaviour scores and the number of services
                  accessed changed significantly during the time of transition. Furthermore, it was found that adaptive behaviour was correlated with school readiness skills, as were physiotherapy and
                  speech-language therapy use. The only variable that correlated with the child’s quality of life was parental involvement in parent support groups. Implications and directions for
                  future research are discussed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A methodology for the catalytic asymmetric hydroboration of vinylarenes with pinacolborane has been developed. Use of pinacolborane in hydroboration, especially catalytic
                  asymmetric hydroboration grants direct access to chiral boronate esters, without the cryogenic temperatures required for catalytic hydroboration with catecholborane and the
                  subsequent transesterification with excess pinacol. These chiral boronate esters were then subjected to a homologation/oxidation sequence previously refined in our labs to prepare
                  Naproxen™ in 66% yield and 88% enantiopurity from its corresponding vinyl arene precursor.&#xD; &#xD; A survey of metal catalysts, solvents and ligands revealed remarkable changes in
                  regioselectivity with changes in metal. Rhodium catalysts in combination with pinacolborane were able to provide regioselectivity for the secondary branched isomer equivalent to
                  those obtained with catecholborane. Iridium catalysts showed a near perfect regioselectivity for the primary linear isomer. With respect to the choice of chiral ligand, complete
                  reversal in the enantiomer obtained was observed with the choice of hydroborating reagent from catecholborane to pinacolborane. &#xD; &#xD; In order to understand the
                  regioselectivity observed under iridium catalysis, deuterium labeling studies were undertaken. A synthesis of the deuterated hydroboration reagent pinacolborane was first completed.
                  From the results of these studies, in combination with published thermodynamic data, a mechanism for the iridium catalyzed hydroboration of alkenes was proposed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The human hand has evolved to be remarkably good at skillfully manipulating objects. This manipulation requires knowledge of the dynamic properties of an object, which is
                  represented in the central nervous system (CNS) by what has been referred to as an internal model. Internal models are neural representations of the predicted behaviour of objects or
                  limbs with a known state in response to a given motor command. Our ability to successfully manipulate a wide variety of objects suggests that the CNS maintains multiple internal
                  models of familiar object dynamics. People are able to both recruit these models for use when an object is grasped and to rapidly switch to another model when the object is
                  exchanged. The purpose of this study was to investigate how internal models of objects are accessed and used for action. In experiment 1, subjects learned to move a cursor to a
                  target by manipulating a robotic arm with complex dynamics. We used event-related fMRI to measure the neural activity associated with grasping the robot handle in preparation for
                  movement. In comparison to control tasks, subjects showed significant neural activation in the ipsilateral cerebellum and the contralateral primary motor and supplementary motor
                  areas, suggesting the likely involvement of these areas in recruitment of internal models. In experiment 2, we used a precision lifting task to investigate how the internal
                  representation of weight asymmetry transfers across changes in hand, hand orientation and object orientation. Subjects demonstrated positive transfer in all cases when the hand was
                  rotated, indicating that internal models of objects can be adapted to accommodate changes in hand orientation. When the object was rotated, positive transfer was seen only when the
                  hand also rotated, suggesting that this change in hand orientation facilitated mental rotation of the object. Overall, these results support the idea that people maintain an internal
                  representation of object dynamics but can not always link this model to the configuration of the object in space.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>A rhodium-catalyzed process has been developed in which mixtures of internal and terminal olefins are isomerized and hydroborated in one step yielding the corresponding
                  terminal pinacolboronates. Homologation and subsequent oxidation regiospecifically affords the terminal aldehyde in what amounts to a one-pot CO free hydroformylation. Good overall
                  yields are obtained in all substrates examined. In a related study, mechanistic aspects of the rhodium catalyzed hydroboration of vinyl arenes have been probed. A combination of
                  substituent effects (Hammett study), deuterium labeling studies and heavy atom isotope effects has demonstrated mechanistic differences in the hydroboration of electron rich and
                  electron poor substrates. The results of the study further demonstrate the differences in reaction mechansim for hydroborations mediated with catecholborane versus
                  pinacolborane.&#xD; &#xD; The Corey-Chaykovsky reaction, in which an aldehyde and a sulfur ylide are coupled to yield an epoxide has proven to be a versatile and valuable method for
                  the production of epoxides. The reaction between benzaldehyde and benzyldimethylsulfonium tetrafluoroborate has been subjected to a kinetic analysis. Activation parameters were
                  determined for the reaction and a large negative ΔS‡ of -35 cal/mol/K was calculated for the epoxidation of benzaldehyde. A large carbon kinetic isotope effect of 1.026 and an
                  inverse deuterium isotope effect of 0.93 were determined for the reaction. A large positive Hammett ρ of +2.50 was found for the epoxidation of various substituted benzaldehydes by
                  competition experiments. These results aided in the identification of the rate limiting step as addition of the ylide species to benzaldehyde. In a separate, although related study,
                  the mechanism of the collapse of hydroxysulfonium salts has been examined with regard for implications in the epoxidation of aldehydes. The anti-diastereomer reacted with complete
                  retention of stereochemistry and no crossover, while the syn-diastereomer gave crossover products along with cis and trans epoxides. Deprotonation and re-protonation on the carbon of
                  the alpha-hydroxy sulfonium ylide was responsible for production of the trans epoxide as demonstrated by deuterium labeling.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>For centuries, scholarship in the area of punishment, prisons and corrections has been generated by a number of different disciplines. It is difficult to argue the fact
                  that there has been a bias in this literature toward discussions of the crimes and punishments of men. Given the historically disproportionate representation of men in criminal
                  justice systems worldwide, the male ‘inmate’ has undoubtedly become the taken-for-granted norm in penality studies. However, works on ‘male imprisonment’ versus ‘female imprisonment’
                  (particularly feminist works) demonstrate a significant disparity in their approach. Despite the extensive nature of scholarship on penality, and the strong focus on gender by
                  feminist scholars in the area, there has been a vast silence on the incarcerated male as a gendered subject, and the male prison as a gendered institution. Although this silence has
                  been briefly noted by feminist scholars in their discussions of female imprisonment (e.g. Hannah-Moffat 2001; Howe 1994; Naffine 1996), few scholars to date have taken up a critical
                  discussion of gender in the context of male incarceration. This oversight is especially characteristic of Canadian penal scholarship and Canadian penal histories in particular. It is
                  the aim of this work to initiate the ‘catch-up,’ to engage in a historical examination of male penality in Canada that draws upon a number of the developments made in both the
                  critical literature on punishment – predominantly focusing on the incarceration of men – and feminist scholarship’s gender approaches to women’s incarceration. Arguably, there is no
                  better point to start this inquiry than with Kingston Penitentiary, Canada’s oldest and long-considered most ‘notorious’ prison for men. Using historical documents from the early
                  history of Kingston Penitentiary (1833-1856), an analysis of discourse using a Foucauldian feminist theoretical approach is performed to uncover the gendered nature of the
                  institution, and the policies and procedures developed for inmate men. Findings suggest that gendered power relations involving a number of different strategies (benevolence,
                  control, pastoralism) and masculinities (aggressive, vulnerable, etc.) were at work. Implications of viewing prisons for men as gendered institutions are discussed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Excessive muscle tone or stiffness secondary to stroke frequently involves the ankle plantarflexors and has been associated with decreased mobility and reduced function.
                  Although becoming more common in clinical practice, the effectiveness of botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) injected in the ankle plantarflexors on gait biomechanics is not well established.
                  The primary objective of this study was to describe the kinematic and kinetic changes that occur during walking following BTX-A treatment of the hypertonic ankle plantarflexors. As
                  well, the study explored whether there were clinical characteristics uniquely associated with subjects that exhibited biomechanical improvement. The study was a single group, open
                  label trial with repeated measures, including multiple baseline and three post-intervention time points. Seven chronic hemiparetic stroke subjects with ankle hypertonicity were
                  included in the study. Full lower limb bilateral gait analysis provided joint kinematic and kinetic information throughout stance. As well, clinical measures of ankle range of motion
                  and spasticity were assessed pre and post treatment. Data were analyzed using paired samples t-tests and repeated measures ANOVA with Least Significant Difference adjustment for
                  post-hoc analysis as necessary (significance level p≤0.05). Of the kinematic variables, significant improvements in peak dorsiflexion and plantarflexion and the ankle angle at
                  initial contact were found 10 weeks post-injection relative to baseline. No significant kinetic changes were detected, however 2 subjects showed improved positive work at the ankle
                  post-injection and 5 subjects demonstrated increased positive work at the hip post-treatment. Although subjects were classified as “responders” or “non-responders” based on clinical
                  improvement observed 2 weeks post-injection, there was no observable association between those who responded clinically and those who demonstrated improved gait. The major findings
                  suggest that BTX-A injection results in tone reduction and in some cases improves the biomechanical efficiency of gait. In cases where kinetic variables remained unchanged following
                  treatment, perhaps the increased tone was not the limiting factor of reduced function.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The purpose of this thesis was to create a computational wrist model that predicts carpal bone motion in order to investigate the complex kinematics of the human wrist. The
                  tuning of this model was primarily based on in vitro, kinematic measurements of the carpal bones obtained from the same cadaver arm as the geometry for the model was generated.&#xD;
                  &#xD; A rigid body spring model of the wrist was built using the kinematic simulation software RecurDynTM 6.1. Surface models of the eight carpal bones, the bases of the five
                  metacarpal bones, and the distal parts of the ulna and radius, all obtained from computed tomography (CT) scans of a cadaver upper limb, were utilized as the geometry for this model.
                  Elastic contact conditions between the rigid bodies modeled the influence of the cartilage layers, and ligamentous structures were constructed using nonlinear, tension-only spring
                  elements. Motion of the wrist was simulated by applying forces to the tendons of the five main wrist muscles modeled.&#xD; &#xD; Three wrist motions were simulated: extension, ulnar
                  deviation and radial deviation. The model was mainly tuned by comparing the simulated displacement and orientation of the carpal bones with previously obtained CT-scans of the same
                  cadaver arm in deviated (45 deg ulnar and 15 deg radial), and extended (57 deg) wrist positions. Simulation results for the scaphoid, lunate, capitate, hamate and triquetrum are
                  presented here and provide credible prediction of carpal bone movement. The impact of certain model parameters on simulation results has been investigated by performing sensitivity
                  analyses, and their severity has been documented.&#xD; &#xD; The results of the first simulations indicate that this model may assist in future wrist kinematics investigations.
                  However, further optimization and validation are required to define and guarantee the reliability of this model. It is suggested that this rigid body spring model may be part of an
                  interacting framework between in vitro and in vivo investigations, as well as other computational models, in order to improve and complement each biomechanical investigation
                  method.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The development of an auxiliary power unit (APU) capable of providing climate control and electricity in long haul trucks is of significant interest due to the expected
                  economic and environmental benefits. A potentially efficient and environmentally friendly APU design is one based on the use of an autothermal fuel reformer that converts on-board
                  truck fuel to a hydrogen rich gas that directly fuels a solid oxide fuel cell unit. To assist in the development of such a unit a numerical study of the autothermal reforming of
                  iso-octane in a compact tubular reactor has been undertaken. This was done to determine the reactor performance and the factors that potentially influence its performance. Variations
                  in the wall thermal conductivity, the catalyst thermal conductivity, the catalyst porosity, the conditions of the inlet reactant gas, and the effectiveness factor of the chemical
                  reaction mechanism have been studied to determine their effects on the performance of the reformer. It has been found that higher thermal conductivities of the outer wall and in the
                  catalyst region gave increased dry hydrogen yield and fuel conversion. The study of the effects of inlet species concentration ratios indicated that maximum hydrogen yield was
                  obtained with an oxygen-to-fuel ratio between 1.0 and 1.15 and a steam-to-fuel ratio of approximately 3.0. Results obtained with various inlet species temperatures and bed porosities
                  showed only small changes in the reformer performance. While the results obtained here do provide useful information about the performance of the autothermal reformer, the model used
                  has been re-assessed and it is recommended that an improved model be used in future work. In particular, the assumed effectiveness factors for all of the chemical reactions occurring
                  in the catalyst region need to be improved. This was highlighted by the fact that a brief study indicated a very strong dependence of the reformer product gas composition on the
                  effectiveness factor. This indicates that while the present model is able to predict trends in the reformer performance, it is limited in its accuracy due to the fact that the
                  effectiveness factor used is only approximately known.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Severe poverty and ethnic-conflicts are the two most devastating problems of the contemporary world. Eighteen million persons die every year from causes related to poverty
                  and a vast amount of developing countries suffer from tremendous processes of destabilization –frequently involving highly violent actions– associated to the relations between
                  majority and minority groups. In both cases, the intervention of international powers and institutions has not been helpful enough to make a difference, and this present reality
                  projects itself as a distressing scene for the future. Human rights and minority rights are the most powerful international tools in trying to change this sad global scenario.
                  However, there is an extensive debate on the nature of these rights in a theory of international justice. This is often characterized as a debate between “minimalist” who seek to
                  reduce the currently –recognized list of human rights to a bare minimum in order to accommodate non-liberal societies, and more expansive liberal approaches, which seek to expand the
                  list of human rights to include the full set of civil and political rights characteristic of modern liberal-democracies. In this thesis, I will argue in favour of a third position.
                  In line with some of the more minimalist approaches, I will argue that constraints of legitimacy rule out attempts to include full civil and political rights into our list of human
                  rights. However, I will argue that these same constraints of legitimacy advocates for expanding the currently-recognized list of human rights in at least two key respects: the
                  recognition of certain basic social and economic rights; and the recognition of certain minority rights. In short, we should be minimalist on some issues, while more expansive in
                  others. &#xD; In developing this argument, I will relay on the framework provided by The Law of Peoples of John Rawls.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Approximately 30% of human breast cancers demonstrate overexpression of the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2/HER2/Neu, with these cases correlating with recurrence and poor
                  prognosis. While therapy targeting ErbB2 has met with some success, particularly in early-stage breast cancers, transformation and progression towards a later-stage metastatic
                  phenotype is likely sustained by aberrant signaling from additional players, for instance that downstream of integrins. In fact, treatment with integrin-blocking antibodies and
                  ß1-integrin ablation leads to reversion of the malignant phenotype of human breast cells in three-dimensional culture and in vivo. Moreover, ErbB2 has recently been found to interact
                  with the ß4-integrin subunit to promote tumour formation and progression, as deletion of the ß4-integrin signaling domain led to suppression of mammary tumour onset and invasive
                  growth, coupled with decreases in ErbB2-dependent signaling. ErbB2 may interact with integrin subunits by direct binding or via the intracellular kinases Src and focal adhesion
                  kinase (FAK), both known to be activated downstream of ErbB2 and integrins and having well-established roles in cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. Using an inducible model of
                  ErbB2 activation, we have demonstrated that controlled ErbB2 activation in human mammary epithelial cells leads to phosphorylation of Src Tyr215 and FAK Tyr861, consistent with a
                  recently published clinical study examining phosphorylated forms of Src and FAK in ErbB2-positive human breast tumour samples. We have also confirmed that ErbB2 activation increases
                  the capacity of cells for survival: Normally, MCF10A human mammary epithelial cells cultured in three-dimensional, laminin-rich extracellular matrix gel form mammary acini-like
                  spheroids with hollow lumen surrounded by a single layer of polarized epithelial cells. However, ErbB2 activation prevents luminal clearance and induces luminal filling in acini
                  formed in three-dimensional culture, and leads to activation of Akt, a known survival signal. Taken together these data indicate a potential role for ErbB2 at the apex of cell
                  survival signaling via Src, FAK, and Akt, contributing to luminal cell survival in three-dimensional culture. We have thus confirmed Src, FAK, and Akt as potential players in early
                  onset of breast cancer, and targeting these signaling players concurrently with ErbB2 may prove effective, especially in early stage breast cancers.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: A beneficial effect of physical activity on the risk of cancer at several sites has been consistently observed. Biologic mechanisms that may underlie this
                  relationship are not well understood. A potential mechanism explaining this relationship for some cancer sites is the influence of physical activity on methionine-homocysteine
                  biosynthesis. High levels of total plasma homocysteine concentration (tHcy) indicate a breakdown in this biochemical process. This cycle’s influences on DNA methylation and
                  endogeneous agents involved in oxidative stress are potential mechanisms linking methionine-homocysteine biosynthesis to cancer risk. This research is nested within a larger cross
                  sectional study of healthy volunteers recruited from centers in Ontario and Nova Scotia aimed at understanding modifiable risk factors for cancer.&#xD; &#xD; Purpose: This research
                  sought to elucidate the relationship between physical activity and tHcy level. &#xD; &#xD; Methods: The target population was healthy male and female subjects aged 20-50.
                  Participants donate a 12ml blood sample after an overnight fast for analysis of tHcy and dietary factors and complete a questionnaire including a physical activity profile for the
                  past month (adapted from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire [IPAQ]) and established predictors of tHcy level such as coffee and alcohol consumption. Multiple linear
                  regression is used to model the relationship between tHcy and physical activity measures while controlling for potential confounders. &#xD; &#xD; Results: Analysis on 171
                  participants has been carried out. Mean tHcy for five quintiles of physical activity (from lowest physical activity score to highest) were found to be 8.40μmol/L (7.76-9.05),
                  8.60μmol/L (8.00, 9.22), 9.24μmol/L (8.66, 9.81), 8.23 μmol/L(7.64, 8.82), and 8.70μmol/L (8.09, 9.31). &#xD; &#xD; Conclusions: The findings of this research do not support a
                  relationship between physical activity and total plasma homocysteine concentration. Results of this study suggest that homocysteine is not a mediating factor for the relationship
                  observed between physical activity and cancer.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Recently, magnetic fields have been detected in a handful of pre-main sequence Herbig Ae and Be (HAeBe) stars. This hints at an evolutionary connection between magnetic
                  HAeBe stars and Ap and Bp stars. Ap/Bp stars are magnetic chemically peculiar main sequence stars, whose origins remain poorly understood. &#xD; In this context the HD 72106 system,
                  a very young double star, is particularly interesting. HD 72106 consists of an intermediate mass primary with a strong magnetic field and an apparently non-magnetic Herbig Ae
                  secondary. In this work we examine 20 high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations of HD 72106A and B, obtained with the ESPaDOnS instrument at the Canada-France-Hawaii
                  Telescope. We find that the HD 72106 system is a true binary, based on the components' positions in space, locations on the H-R diagram, and dynamical properties. For the primary we
                  determine an effective temperature Teff = 11000 ± 1000 K and a mass of 2.4 ± 0.4 M ; while for the secondary we find Teff = 8750 ± 500 K and M = 1.9 ± 0.2 M . &#xD; Through detailed
                  spectral modeling, strong chemical peculiarities characteristic of Ap/Bp stars are found in the primary. Abundances of 10 times the solar value are found for Fe, Si and Ti, with Cr
                  100 times solar and Nd 1000 times solar. Helium is found to display less than 1/10 the solar abundance. By contrast, detailed spectrum modeling of the secondary shows that it
                  possesses approximately solar abundances. &#xD; The rotation period and magnetic field geometry of the primary are investigated in detail. A remarkably short rotation period of
                  0.63995 ± 0.00014 days is derived. A dipole magnetic field geometry is found, with Bp = 1300 ± 100 G, beta = 60 ± 5 , and i = 23 ± 11 . Doppler Imaging of the surface distribution of
                  Si, Ti, Cr, and Fe is performed for the primary, and strong inhomogeneities are found. All four maps present similar abundance patterns, with a large spot near the positive magnetic
                  pole. &#xD; Implications of these results, particularly with respect to the stage of evolution at which chemical peculiarities arise, are discussed.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Background: Antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and venlafaxine have the potential to exert beneficial effects on the heart via
                  serotonin mediated antiplatelet activity. However, previous evidence regarding the cardiovascular effects of these agents has been conflicting. There is a need for further
                  investigation into the risks and benefits of these drugs.&#xD; Objective: To assess the risk of acute MI and cardiac death associated the use of various classes of antidepressants,
                  and determine whether this risk is modified by the presence of predisposing factors.&#xD; Methods: We identified a population-based, retrospective cohort study of 71,253 elderly
                  persons initiating treatment with an antidepressant between 1997 and 2004. The cohort was analyzed using nested case-control approach with each case of acute MI or cardiac death
                  matched with up to 20 controls according to age (±1 year), duration of follow-up, and year of cohort entry. Rate ratios for acute MI and cardiac death associated with the current use
                  of various antidepressants were estimated using conditional logistic regression and adjusted for potential confounders.&#xD; Results: Compared with the current use of atypical
                  antidepressants, current use of venlafaxine was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of MI and cardiac death (rate ratio [RR] 0.80 [95% CI 0.66 to 0.97]) that was more
                  pronounced in persons with established cardiovascular disease (CVD) (RR 0.65 [CI 0.50 to 0.86]). We found no clear evidence of a benefit or harm associated with the use of SSRIs (RR
                  0.92 [CI 0.79 to 1.06]), although there was the suggestion of a clinically important benefit from treatment with SSRIs for individuals who had history of MI (RR 0.68 [CI 0.44 to
                  1.07]). No benefit or harm was observed with other classes of antidepressants.&#xD; Conclusions: These results demonstrate a reduced risk for acute MI and cardiac death associated
                  with current use of venlafaxine among elderly persons. This beneficial effect appears to be more pronounced in those with established cardiovascular disease. No clear evidence of
                  benefit on CV outcomes was associated with the current use of SSRIs, although results suggest a potential benefit for use in persons with a previous MI.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>An independent set in a graph G is a set of pairwise nonadjacent vertices, and the maximum size, alpha(G), of an independent set in G is called the independence
                  number.&#xD; Given a graph G and weight matrix A of G with entries from some field F, the maximum dimension of an A-isotropic subspace, known as the Witt index of A, is an upper
                  bound on alpha(G). Since any weight matrix can be used, it is natural to seek the minimum upper bound on the independence number of G that can be achieved by a weight matrix.
                  This&#xD; minimum, iota_F^*(G), is called the minimum Witt index of G over F, and the resulting bound, alpha(G)&lt;= iota_F^*(G), is called&#xD; the isotropic bound.&#xD; &#xD; When
                  F is finite, the possible values of iota_F^*(G) are determined and the graphs that attain the isotropic bound are characterized. The characterization is given in terms of graph
                  classes CC(n,t,c)&#xD; and CK(n,t,k) constructed from certain spanning subgraphs called C(n,t,c)-graphs and K(n,t,k)-graphs. Here t is the term rank&#xD; of the adjacency matrix of
                  G.&#xD; &#xD; When F=R, the isotropic bound is known as the Cvetkovi\'c bound. It is shown that it is sufficient to consider a finite number of&#xD; weight matrices A when
                  determining iota_R^*(G) and that, in many cases, two weight values suffice. For example, if the vertex set of G can be covered by alpha(G) cliques, then G attains the Cvetkovi\'c
                  bound with a weight matrix with two weight values.&#xD; &#xD; Inequalities on alpha and iota_F^* resulting from graph operations such as sums, products, vertex deletion, and vertex
                  identification are examined and, in some cases, conditions that imply equality are proved. The equalities imply that the problem of determining whether or not alpha(G)=iota_F^*(G)
                  can be reduced to that of determining iota_F^*(H) for certain crucial graphs H found from G.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The dependability of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) relies on two factors: ability to detect intrusions and survivability in hostile environments. Machine
                  learning-based anomaly detection approaches are gaining increasing attention in the network intrusion detection community because of their intrinsic ability to discover novel
                  attacks. This ability has become critical since the number of new attacks has kept growing in recent years. However, most of today’s anomaly-based IDSs generate high false positive
                  rates and miss many attacks because of a deficiency in their ability to discriminate attacks from legitimate behaviors. These unreliable results damage the dependability of IDSs. In
                  addition, even if the detection method is sound and effective, the IDS might still be unable to deliver detection service when under attack. With the increasing importance of the
                  IDS, some attackers attempt to disable the IDS before they launch a thorough attack. In this thesis, we propose a Dependable Network Intrusion Detection System (DNIDS) based on the
                  Combined Strangeness and Isolation measure K-Nearest Neighbor (CSI-KNN) algorithm. The DNIDS can effectively detect network intrusions while providing continued service even under
                  attacks. The intrusion detection algorithm analyzes different characteristics of network data by employing two measures: strangeness and isolation. Based on these measures, a
                  correlation unit raises intrusion alerts with associated confidence estimates. In the DNIDS, multiple CSI-KNN classifiers work in parallel to deal with different types of network
                  traffic. An intrusion-tolerant mechanism monitors the classifiers and the hosts on which the classifiers reside and enables the IDS to survive component failure due to intrusions. As
                  soon as a failed IDS component is discovered, a copy of the component is installed to replace it and the detection service continues. We evaluate our detection approach over the
                  KDD’99 benchmark dataset. The experimental results show that the performance of our approach is better than the best result of KDD’99 contest winner’s. In addition, the intrusion
                  alerts generated by our algorithm provide graded confidence that offers some insight into the reliability of the intrusion detection. To verify the survivability of the DNIDS, we
                  test the prototype in simulated attack scenarios. In addition, we evaluate the performance of the intrusion-tolerant mechanism and analyze the system reliability. The results
                  demonstrate that the mechanism can effectively tolerate intrusions and achieve high dependability.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>The influence of body size on metabolic rate, muscle enzyme activities, and the underlying patterns of mRNA for these enzymes were explored in an effort to explain the
                  genetic basis of allometric variation in metabolic enzymes. Two pairs of sister species of centrarchid fishes were studied: black bass (largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides and
                  smallmouth bass, Micropterus dolomieui), and sunfish (pumpkinseed, Lepomis gibbosus and bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus). The goal was to assess the regulatory basis of both
                  intraspecific and interspecific variation in relation to body size, as well as gain insights into the evolutionary constraints within lineages. Whole animal routine metabolic rate
                  showed scaling coefficients not significantly different from 1, ranging from +0.87 to +0.96. However, there were significant effects of body size on the specific activities of
                  oxidative and glycolytic enzymes. Mass-specific activity of the oxidative enzyme citrate synthase (CS) scaled negatively with body size in each species, with scaling coefficients
                  ranging from -0.15 to -0.19 whereas the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK) showed positive scaling, with scaling coefficients ranging from +0.08 to +0.23. The ratio of
                  mass-specific enzyme activity in PK to CS increased with body size, whereas the ratio of mRNA transcripts of PK to CS was unaffected, suggesting the enzyme relationships were not due
                  simply to transcriptional regulation of both genes. The mass-dependent differences in PK activities were best explained by transcriptional regulation of the muscle PK gene; PK mRNA
                  was a good predictor of PK specific enzyme activity within species and between species. Conversely, CS mRNA did not correlate with CS specific enzyme activities, suggesting
                  post-transcriptional mechanisms may explain the observed inter-specific and intraspecific differences in oxidative enzymes.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>My thesis examines how identity was constructed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century amidst the growing possibilities of the cross-cultural transfer of ideas
                  and products by analysing case studies of women-owned and -operated craft organisations: Limerick Lace and Clare Embroidery (Ireland) and the Deerfield Society of Blue and White
                  Needlework (United States). I contend that the increased accessibility of print culture, travel and tourism, and World’s Fairs enabled the women responsible for these craft
                  organisations to integrate a pastiche of artistic influences – those recognised as international, national, and local – in order to create a specific and distinct style of craft. The
                  Arts and Crafts movement, with its ideas about art, craft, design, and display, provided a supra-national language of social and artistic reform that sought to address the harshness
                  of industrialisation and to elevate the status of craft and design. The national framework of revival movements – the Celtic Revival in Ireland and Colonial Revival in the United
                  States – promoted the notion that Folk and peasant culture was fundamental to each country’s heritage, and its preservation and renewal was essential to fostering and legitimising a
                  strong national identity. I critically access the way these case studies, which were geographically separate yet linked through chronology, gender, and craft, operated within these
                  international and national movements, yet they negotiated these larger ideologies to construct identities that also reflected their local circumstances. My intention is to unite
                  social history with material culture in order to investigate the ways in which the discussion and display of the crafts, and the artistic components of the textiles themselves
                  operated as a vehicle for establishing identity.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>This paper attempts to clarify the role mass nouns play in our language, including what they designate and how they designate it. In particular, this paper focuses on
                  demonstrating that mass nouns do not individuate the stuff they designate and consequences for this non-individuative theory.&#xD; In order to demonstrate that mass nouns do not
                  individuate, I examine grammatical rules for mass nouns and contrast them with rules for singular and plural count nouns. Furthermore, I examine several possible truth conditions for
                  sentences involving mass nouns and demonstrate that no truth conditions which individuate are acceptable.&#xD; Once this lack of individuation has been demonstrated, I examine issues
                  that arise in language and metaphysics. This examination is necessary because most of our understanding of language and metaphysics centers around medium sized objects. Since mass
                  nouns do not individuate, they are not designating medium sized objects. &#xD; When examining developments in language, I suggest that the term “the” does not imply uniqueness but
                  rather exhaustiveness and there is already an intuitive way to capture this in first order logic using universals. Furthermore, I suggest that stuff designated by mass nouns cannot
                  be directly referred to and hence cannot occur in a singular term in first-order logic. Finally, I suggest that identity statements should be treated without the identity relation
                  and instead using a biconditional and a universal.&#xD; When examining developments in metaphysics, I suggest that there cannot be a criterion of identity for stuff because a
                  criterion of identity asks what a single instance is and stuff does not occur in individual instances. Furthermore, I suggest that identity and persistence conditions differentiate
                  for stuff in a way that they do not for individual things.&#xD; Finally, I address what more must be done in order to have a complete treatment of mass nouns and stuff. This section
                  focuses primarily on first-order logic and how to make stuff a value of a variable while maintaining ontological import. Work in this area still needs to be done and is, I believe,
                  of significant importance.</dcterms:abstract>

      <dcterms:abstract>Abstract&#xD; Methyldiphenylphosphonium cyclopentadienylide, C5H4PMePh2 (II), has been&#xD; synthesized and characterized spectroscopically and&#xD; crystallographically,

                  the ylide is between that of the cyclopentadienyl anion (Cp-) and&#xD; benzene, but closer to Cp-. The electronic structures of II and of (η5-&#xD; C5H4PMePh2)Cr(CO)3 have been
                  investigated using ab initio methodologies. Thermal&#xD; and photochemical substitutions of the CO ligands of (η5-C5H4PMePh2)M(CO)3 (M = Cr,&#xD; Mo) by equimolar amounts of PMe3 and
                  PPh3 were not observed, but the ylide is&#xD; displaced photochemically from (η5-C5H4PMePh2)Mo(CO)3 by excess PMe3 to form fac-&#xD; Mo(CO)3(PMe3)3 while (η5-C5H4PMePh2)Mo(CO)3
                  reacts with I2 to form [(η5-&#xD; C5H4PMePh2)Mo(CO)3I]I.&#xD; One electron oxidations of (η5-C5H4PMePh2)M(CO)3 (M = Cr, Mo, W) have been&#xD; performed to give the cationic radicals

                  been fully characterized spectroscopically and&#xD; crystallographically. It has been determined that the chromium dimer ((η5-&#xD; C5H4PMePh2)Cr(CO)3)2&#xD; 2+ undergoes
                  dissociation extensively in solution to the persistent&#xD; radical cation monomer (η5-C5H4PMePh2)Cr(CO)3&#xD; +, but that the heavier metal analogues&#xD; iii&#xD;
                  ((η5-C5H4PMePh2)M(CO)3)2&#xD; 2+ (M = Mo, W) dissociate very little, if at all. The Cr-Cr&#xD; bond distance of the chromium complex is 3.3509(7) Å, which is the longest Cr-Cr
                  bond&#xD; distance known for a compound not containing some type of ligand bridging the metalmetal&#xD; bond.&#xD; The hitherto unknown indenyl-derived ylide, C9H6PMePh2, has been
                  synthesized&#xD; and characterized spectroscopically and crystallographically. The chromium tricarbonyl&#xD; complex of this ligand, (η5-C9H6PMePh2)Cr(CO)3, has been synthesized
                  and&#xD; characterized spectroscopically and crystallographically. This complex is a mixture of&#xD; two isomers exhibiting planar chirality generated upon coordination of the
                  ligand. This&#xD; complex represents the first structurally characterized phosphorus noncyclopentadienylide&#xD; coordinated in an η5 manner. The spectroscopic and
