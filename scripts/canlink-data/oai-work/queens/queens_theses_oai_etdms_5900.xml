   <description>This thesis studies instances of credit constraints in Canadian history. In Chapter 2, I study the productivity of Canadian industrial establishments in late nineteenth century Canada. In particular, I look at the relationship between the perceived credit worthiness of proprietors of industrial establishments, capital accumulation, and productivity. I show that the productivity gap of 22-38%, between Ontario and Quebec, that existed in 1871, could have been reduced by between a quarter and three quarters if francophone-Catholics had received the same credit ratings as anglophone-non-Catholics. In Chapter 3, co-authored with David Rosé, we study the entry of French Canadian credit unions, caisses populaires, into rural Quebec over the 1911 to 1931 period. Using propensity score matching methods, we showed that the caisses populaires slowed down rural exodus. Sub-districts where a caisse was established exhibited 7-9% higher population growth--total, rural, and French--compared to sub-districts where no caisse was established. In Chapter 4, co-authored with Gregor W. Smith, we look for evidence of a correlation between output growth and inflation, or unexpected inflation, during the interwar period, which featured an abundance of credit, followed by a credit crunch. Using time-series and panel data methods for more than 20 countries, including Canada, we find little evidence of a correlation between unexpected inflation and output growth.</description>

   <description>This research explores drilling mud intrusion into sand surrounding a horizontal boring and its effects on the soil properties. At the first stage, small-scale laboratory experiments investigated the effects of bentonite mud on soil gradation of sand in horizontal directional drilling (HDD). Two pressure vessels were used, one as the test chamber and the other one as a mud tank. A hose connected the bottom of the mud tank, pressurized by connecting it to a compressor, to the lid of the test chamber. The pressurized mud was applied on top of the sand. Eight tests were run on dry sand to monitor the effects of mud penetration into sand of four different factors: mud pressure, bentonite concentration, soil density, and test duration. &#xd;
At the end of each test, the % bentonite intruded into sand was determined for every 10 mm soil layers as the difference between the % finer than of the initial sand and the mud-sand mix. The results showed a higher % bentonite intruded into sand for loose sand compared with the dense one at the same pressure and bentonite content of the drilling fluid. Also, a higher % bentonite was obtained in the first 4 layers of the soil for the test with a 5% bentonite drilling fluid compared with 3% and 4% ones on the same loose sand and at the same mud pressure; however, this percentage of bentonite intrusion for the bottom layers of the specimen with a 5% bentonite drilling fluid is less than 3% and 4% ones. As expected, more bentonite penetrates into the sand for a constant mud pressure and the same loose state of the sand when tests have longer duration.&#xd;
In the second stage of the project, triaxial tests were run on remolded sand samples mixed with the measured percentages of bentonite intruded into soil samples seen during the mud intrusion tests. Thus, the soil strength parameters and the undrained shear strength of the sand-mud mixes were obtained at different confining stresses were obtained, considering the effects of mud intrusion on the short-term response of the soil expected during a directional drilling project.</description>

   <description>With the rise of Platonism influenced by Plotinus and Descartes, philosophers have largely overlooked the fact that Plato directly acknowledges that there is a practical and valuable role for the body. The Timaeus clearly demonstrates that Plato took the idea of embodied minds seriously, not just as an afterthought of the immortal soul. Ultimately this research demonstrates that Plato did not fundamentally have a problem with the mind-body relationship. In offering an argument for Plato’s positive ideas of embodied minds and the necessity thereof, I will also demonstrate, through a historical comparative, why I think the emphasis on mind rather than on embodied mind might have occurred.</description>

   <title>Exploring Politics, Practices, and Discourses of Harm Reduction in the Overdose Crisis:  the Case of the Tenant Overdose Response Organizers and the “Therapeutic Riskscape”</title>

   <description>Harm reduction, its aspirations, politics, and discourses, have changed dramatically since its origins as a grassroots, drug user-led movement in Canada. Public health played a critical role in helping implement harm reduction, but in doing so has aligned it in ways that have accommodated neoliberal priorities and technocratic discourses, thus contributing to its depoliticization as a social movement. By absconding from meaningfully attending to social determinants of health, which underlie drug-related harm in favour of risk-mitigating individual approaches, public health’s implementation of harm reduction has fallen short in challenging social injustices and inequities at the root of Canada’s legacy of drug criminalization. The arrival of fentanyl and the overdose crisis in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside (DTES) has proven to be a turning point in this history by leading marginalized tenants of privately-owned single room occupancy (SRO) hotels to organize overdose response for one another. In December 2016, the Downtown Eastside SRO Collaborative Society, a housing advocacy organization, partnered with public health to develop the Tenant Overdose Response Organizers (TORO) program, which uses community organizing to support these efforts. Through participant observation and key stakeholder interviews undertaken between November 2017 and April 2018, this research explores harm reduction’s politics, practices, and discourses through a case study of the novel, peer-led TORO program. I found that despite the hesitancy of public health to support housing advocacy as a critical component of harm reduction, TORO has supported SRO tenants in their responses to oppressive physical, social, and structural environments. My analysis of the work of TORO within the broader context of the DTES has also supported the development of the “therapeutic riskscape” as a theory that attempts to provide an approach to harm reduction that recognizes the recursive relationship between community-driven responses to structural environments and relational experiences of place-based healing.</description>

   <description>Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in Canadian males. Survivorship rates, particularly for early-stage diagnoses, are high, meaning that the majority of diagnosed individuals must live with the consequences of the disease and its treatments. The purpose of this study was to investigate the experiences of individuals diagnosed with prostate cancer, specifically their health-related quality of life, sexual outcomes, mental health, social support, and experiences with the healthcare system. As well, this study sought to compare the experiences of heterosexual/cisgender and GLBTQ+ (e.g., gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, queer) prostate cancer patients. One-hundred and four participants who had been diagnosed with non-metastatic prostate cancer with no other cancer diagnosis completed an online survey which included a demographics questionnaire, questions about cancer diagnosis and treatment history, and measures of health-related quality of life, changes to sexual roles and activities, sexual satisfaction, sexual script flexibility, symptoms of depression and anxiety, social support, and satisfaction with care. In terms of overall health-related quality of life, there was no significant difference between individuals who had or had not undergone surgical treatment; however, surgical patients reported significantly worse urinary incontinence. For individuals with low to moderate sexual functioning, better sexual script flexibility was predictive of greater sexual satisfaction. Compared to their retrospective reports of pre-treatment sexual activity, after treatment, participants engaged in less frequent sexual activity, fewer identified as being in the insertive intercourse role, and many were no longer sexually active. Greater emotional support was predictive of fewer symptoms of depression, which in turn predicted better overall health-related quality of life. With regards to their healthcare experiences, participants most frequently reported wanting information on erectile functioning from their healthcare providers; for all topics of information, there were participants who wanted information from a healthcare provider but did not receive it. Finally, there were no significant differences between heterosexual/cisgender and GLBTQ+ participants on satisfaction with care, mental health, or health-related quality of life. Implications for prostate cancer patient care and directions for future research are discussed.</description>

   <description>The transition metal-catalyzed ene-cycloisomerization is a particularly attractive method for the construction of highly functionalized cyclic scaffolds.  Furthermore, many elegant studies over the past few decades have led to the development of several unique methods for this transformation, employing a variety of transition metal-catalysts.  In particular, the ene-cycloisomerization reaction provides carbo- and heterocyclic skeletons in a highly selective and atom-economical manner, thus offering an efficient strategy for the total synthesis of a number of natural products.  The following thesis commences with a very brief introduction followed by two major section (Chapter 2 and 3) and a concluding chapter.  &#xd;
Chapter 1 serves as a brief introduction and provides an overall outline for this thesis.&#xd;
Chapter 2 provides an introduction to the development of transition-metal-catalyzed ene-cycloisomerization reaction with an overview of the different reaction pathways (Section 2.1).  This chapter is then divided into subsections (2.2-2.9), that are organized based on the nature of the transition metal-catalyzed ene-cycloisomerization reaction, which depends on the degree of saturation in the substrates. &#xd;
Chapter 3 commences with a review of the utility of alkylidenecyclopropanes (abbreviated thereafter as “ACPs”) in transition metal-catalyzed reactions.  Section 3.2 provides an in-depth discussion of the reactivity of ACPs in these transformations, in which the behavior of these substrates with four different metal catalysts (Pd, Rh, Ru, Ni) is discussed.  Section 3.3 describes our work on the development of the novel rhodium-catalyzed ene-cycloisomerization reaction of ACPs tethered to an allylic sulfide, which undergo an unprecedented β-sulfide elimination/migration to highlight the importance of the organosulfur chemistry.  The subsequent section (Section 3.4) outlines the development of a nickel-catalyzed sulfide elimination/migration to provide products with two new stereogenic centers and one three-membered-ring.  Section 3.5 outlines our efforts towards the rhodium catalyzed β-silyl elimination/migration.  A detailed optimization and scope of this transformation is described, along with mechanistic studies.&#xd;
Finally, Chapter 4 provides a conclusion and overview of the methodologies described in this thesis and their synthetic application, especially in the synthesis of important natural products.</description>

   <title>The Logically Perfect Language on Words without Objects</title>

   <description>Bertrand Russell’s logical atomism holds that the world is made up of a body of structured facts composed of simple objects. A Logically Perfect Language (LPL) is constructed to reflect this hierarchy of facts—every sentence in a LPL corresponds to a fact, and how these sentences are related accurately reflects how their corresponding facts are related. This paper is divided into four parts. I will first explain Russell’s conception and construction of a LPL. Then, I will explain Henry Laycock’s modified account of a singular-general dichotomy; propositions about multiple objects and stuffs need to be taken into account. In the third part, I will focus on the difficulty of integrating propositions about the non-discrete liquid-stuff in an objectual language. In the fourth part, I will examine two problems, namely, the semantics-syntax discrepancy in a LPL and the problem of collective predication. Finally, after characterizing the individuation condition for liquid-stuffs, I will motivate individuating them as discrete portions for the purposes of particular predication. I will develop a new conception of what constitute a single instance of liquid-stuff, and use this new conception to characterize the preliminary works before the construction of a LPL for liquid-stuffs.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this dissertation was to study the effects of exercise training on the plasma metabolome and phenotypic changes in men and women with abdominal obesity, using both metabolomics and magnetic resonance imaging technologies. Our findings are based on data collected from a randomized controlled trial, wherein participants were assigned to a low amount low intensity, high amount low intensity, high amount high intensity, or control group. The objective of Study 1 was to examine plasma metabolome changes in response to chronic exercise and whether changes in metabolites are associated with change in cardiometabolic risk factors. While no significant differences between measured metabolites in the control and exercise arms were observed, we identified significant associations between changes in metabolite concentrations and improvements in cardiometabolic traits following exercise. These findings were based on the average group response; however, recent interest in personalized exercise medicine has prompted investigation of individual responses to exercise training. Given the epidemic of excess adiposity globally, characterizing the heterogeneity in adipose tissue (AT) response to exercise is clinically important. The objective of Study 2 was to characterize the magnitude and clinical relevance of individual responses for AT reduction following standardized exercise. We demonstrated that the probability of an individuals’ reduction in total and abdominal AT being clinically meaningful was greater than controls, independent of amount and/or intensity. The objective of Study 3 was to integrate our findings by assessing the influence of AT reduction on the plasma metabolome and subsequent changes in cardiometabolic risk following exercise. We found that exercise-induced reduction in visceral AT was independently associated with increases in pyroglutamic acid (linked to glutamate metabolism) and TCA cycle intermediates (succinic and fumaric acid). Taken together, our observations suggest that (1) alterations in metabolites are related to changes in cardiometabolic traits; (2) part of the relationship between metabolite changes and cardiometabolic traits may be explained by AT reduction following exercise; and (3) given that the magnitude of adiposity reduction is associated with identifiable plasma metabolites, it is possible blood-based measures can reflect a given individual’s AT response to exercise.</description>

   <description>This dissertation introduces and defines .compostmodernism as a successor to postmodernism in the particular context of twenty-first century literature. Having roots in the postmodern literary era when the anxiety about print literature’s obsolescence was at its peak, .compostmodernism is born of the increasing influence of media and technology on literature in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. The dissertation begins by defining postmodern literature’s relationship to new media and technology in the 1960s and beyond, working toward the various definitions for post-postmodernism today. Following, it offers a definition of .compostmodernism as the literary composting of “dead” and bygone postmodern and modern literary tenets—namely postmodern irony and new (modern) sincerity— with twenty-first century digitality in content, narrative form, typography, materiality and finally, medium before offering a preliminary case study with Thomas Pynchon’s Bleeding Edge (2013). Through a close reading of Tao Lin’s Taipei (2013), it introduces literary cyber-consciousness as a crucial component of the .compostmodern novel: a narrative form that, while composting postmodern self-parody and modern stream of consciousness, emerges as the literary embodiment of the intermediation between human cognition and the digital machine. Through a visual engagement with Mark Z. Danielewski’s The Familiar (2015), it introduces .compostmodern textual machinery, a two-tiered machine. First, the printed book is a textual machine in which the novel’s typographical experimentation visually reflects the metaphorical digital machinery of the codex and second, the reader’s physical relationship to the text as prompted by the typographical experimentation emerges as a mode of .compostmodern operation. The dissertation concludes by opening up .compostmodernism’s potential beyond literary fiction and exploring its presence in Amaranth Borsuk and Brad Bouse’s poetry collection, Between Page and Screen (2012) and Skip Brittenham and Brian Haberlin’s genre fiction graphic novel, Shifter (2013). While offering a set of solid .compostmodern applications in literature, this dissertation begins the important conversation around literature’s survival in an increasingly digital culture.</description>

   <title>An examination of team structure and its implications for subgroups in an individual sport setting</title>

   <description>Despite growing research interest in the social dynamics of sport teams, the smaller groups that emerge from within a total team have largely been overlooked.  This is concerning given that preliminary investigations highlight the inevitability of their presence, in addition to the potential for them to generate both adaptive and maladaptive outcomes (Martin et al., 2015, 2016; Wagstaff et al., 2017).  However, several shortcomings identified in this exploratory body of literature were its (a) inclusion of only one perspective (either athletes or coaches), (b) from a range of different sport teams, without consideration for (c) changes over time, and (d) the specific sport structure that might predispose division within a team.  As such, the purpose of this study was to explore how sport structure predisposes a team to subgroup and clique formation, and thus, influences athlete interactions and team functioning.  Track and field was chosen as it represents an individual sport composed of several smaller teams ranging in teammate interdependence and event types. &#xd;
An in-depth case-study design was selected, composed of several interviews conducted over the course of a competition season.  A single Canadian intercollegiate track and field team was selected, wherein 15 participants (4 coaches, 11 athletes) provided various perspectives from across the team.  Semi-structured interviews were conducted early and post season, and transcripts were analyzed using a combination of thematic and exception analyses (Braun et al., 2016; Phoenix &amp; Orr, 2017).&#xd;
Results indicated that this track and field team had a multitude of inherent structural constraints (sport type, event type, facility/schedule limitations, team size, change over time) that directly impacted athlete interactions and predisposed the group to subgroup and clique formation. Consequently, much of the team’s energy was directed toward the management of the social environment (e.g., athlete interactions, cooperation) by undertaking team building activities, utilizing the leadership core, emphasizing consistent and quality communication, and generating individual buy-in.  These findings have both theoretical and practical implications and are discussed as they related to the literature.  Future directions and study strengths and limitations are advanced herein.</description>

   <title>Mechanisms Contributing to the Specificity of Gynephilic Men’s Sexual Responses</title>

   <description>Men’s sexual responses have historically been characterized by their gender specificity, meaning that men show stronger genital and subjective arousal to preferred (i.e., sexual stimuli that include one’s preferred gender) versus non-preferred (i.e., sexual stimuli that do not include one’s preferred gender) sexual stimuli. But recent work suggests that many gynephilic (i.e., sexually attracted to women) men show varying degrees of same-sex attraction, fantasies, and behaviours. Previous research on men’s gender-specific sexual responses has not investigated potential bidirectional relationships between men’s attentional, affective, and genital responses to non-preferred sexual stimuli. New information about these relationships will contribute to our understanding of gynephilic men’s capacity for nonexclusive sexual attractions. Two models of sexual responding, the information processing model and the incentive motivation model, include pathways that detail the role of initial attention, controlled attention, and affect in activating or inhibiting arousal to nonpreferred sexual stimuli. Across two studies, these models of sexual responding are used as a framework to explore how greater negative affect (i.e., homonegativity and trait-level disgust) and attentional biases (i.e. vigilant initial attention and avoidant controlled attention) reduce men’s sexual responses to non-preferred sexual stimuli. In Study 1, which examined men’s detection of human stimuli at the earliest stages of stimulus processing, gynephilic men were more accurate when they identified images of nude women than when they identified images of clothed men or clothed women. There was no significant difference in their speed and accuracy, however, when detecting nude women versus nude men, suggesting that gynephilic men’s gender-specific sexual responses may only occur during later stages of processing. In Study 2, which examined men’s visual attention and genital responses during later stages of stimulus processing, greater levels of homonegativity and trait-level disgust predicted attentional avoidance of sexual stimuli featuring men, as well as lower genital responses to these stimuli. Results expand our current understanding of men’s sexuality by identifying factors that contribute to gender-specific and gender-nonspecific sexual responses in gynephilic men. Future work should explore whether gynephilic men’s sexual behaviours become increasingly malleable as society continues to become more accepting of same-sex sexuality.</description>

   <description>Movement quality screening tools have been developed to reduce the risk of injury and enhance physical performance. These screening tools use observational techniques to analyze movement and identify faulty movement patterns. One variable that is used in some screening tools and that is a valid predictor of injury is movement asymmetry. The issue is that screening tools are currently assessing asymmetry from a kinematic perspective by observing the individual during their movement execution, while discounting potential asymmetric behaviour at the kinetic or muscle activity components of movement. The purpose of this study was to evaluate movement asymmetry from a kinematic, kinetic, and muscle activity component to identify whether differences exist between the components of movement. &#xd;
&#xd;
Kinematic, kinetic, and muscle activity data were collected from thirty-four healthy young adults as they performed twenty-five parallel squats in five conditions: normal, slow metronome, normal metronome, fast metronome, and weighted squat. The kinematic component was represented by joint angles, while the kinetic component was represented by joint moments and the muscle activity component was represented by electromyography amplitude. Cross-correlations and normalized RMS values were calculated between the left and right ankle, knee, and hip at each component of measurement. Multiple two-way repeated measures ANOVAs assessed the difference between the conditions and the components of measurement. &#xd;
&#xd;
Results demonstrated a significant difference in cross-correlations and normalized RMS values between the kinematic, kinetic, and muscle activity components at the ankle, knee, and hip. Generally, there was no significant difference between the conditions in terms of asymmetry measures. These results present an important consideration for movement quality screening tools: are we getting the full picture when evaluating movement using observational techniques and focusing on kinematic measures?</description>

   <title>Exploring Perceptions of Public Stigma as a Mediator in the Relationship between Number of Depressive Symptoms and Mental Health Treatment-Seeking Behaviours</title>

   <subject>public stigma, treatment-seeking, help-seeking, depression, symptoms</subject>
   <description>Background: Individuals with more depressive symptoms are more likely to seek treatment. However, there is evidence suggesting that these same individuals may be more likely to feel stigmatized. As expectations of public stigmatization may discourage treatment-seeking from those who would benefit the most, it is important to gain a better understanding of the interplay among these variables.&#xd;
Objective: The aim of this thesis was to determine if perceived public stigma towards people with depression acts as a mediator in the relationship between the number of depressive symptoms and mental health treatment-seeking behaviour.&#xd;
Methods: This study utilized secondary, cross sectional data from Statistics Canada’s 2010 Canadian Community Health Survey, including a rapid response stigma module. Participants (ages 12-101) were from the regions of Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Alberta, and the Northwest Territories and were interviewed between May-June 2010 (N = 2,087). SAS 9.4 survey procedures incorporated the sampling weights and bootstrap variance estimation procedures. Multiple linear regression and logistic regression were used to assess the associations of interest. Sobel’s formula for standard error was used to construct 95% confidence intervals around the estimate of the indirect effect. &#xd;
Results: For both females and males, the number of depressive symptoms experienced positively predicted the likelihood of mental health treatment-seeking. In females, but not in males, there was a significant, positive association between number of depressive symptoms and perceived public stigma. For both females and males, when the number of depressive symptoms was statistically controlled, there was no association between perceived public stigma towards depression and mental health treatment-seeking. Perceived public stigma towards depression did not mediate the relationship between number of depressive symptoms and mental health treatment-seeking behaviour.&#xd;
Conclusion: Results of this study show that perceived public stigma towards depression does not mediate the relationship between number of depressive symptoms and mental health treatment-seeking behaviour. As one of the first studies to assess the associations among number of depressive symptoms, perceived public stigma towards depression, and mental health treatment-seeking behaviour, the results from this study contribute new information to the mixed body of literature.</description>

   <description>Background: Chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) in Canada. Although the literature has focused on individual-level risk factors as the greatest determinants for chlamydia infection, more recent research has investigated the role of neighbourhood socioeconomic status (SES) on risk for chlamydia infection. The present study aims to investigate the relationship between multiple area- and individual-level risk factors and chlamydia infection in a sexual health clinic.&#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: Individuals who were tested for chlamydia at the Kingston, Frontenac and Lennox &amp; Addington (KFL&amp;A) Public Health sexual health clinic from April 2016 to March 2017 were included in this study. The four indices of the Ontario Marginalization (ON-Marg) Index; namely, material deprivation, dependency, residential instability and ethnic concentration, were used as measures of neighbourhood SES. Individual-level risk factors included variables that were captured from the questionnaire administered at the time of examination. Logistic regression was used to compute odds ratios (OR) for all risk factor variables. Outcome data was plotted on a geographic information system (GIS) to compare marginalization differences based on chlamydia test result.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results: A total of 1775 individuals were tested for chlamydia at the Clinic, with 208 (11.7%) testing positive on their first Clinic visit. Age (OR=4.84, 95% CI 2.18-10.74; &lt;20 versus >40 years), number of sexual partners in the previous 2 months (OR=3.11, 95% CI 1.06-9.10; 2 partner versus no partners), condom use (OR=2.09, 95% CI 1.07-4.09; rarely versus always using condoms), and STI contact (OR=6.16, 95% CI 4.35-8.74) were significant individual-level predictors for infection. Apart from ethnic concentration of the ON-Marg Index, there was a trend suggesting an association between the highest levels of marginalization and increased odds of chlamydia infection compared to the lowest levels of marginalization. However, this association was only statistically significant for the dependency index (OR=1.90, 95% CI: 1.05-3.43; most deprived versus least deprived).&#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions: Populations living in highly marginalized neighbourhoods, an established marker of low SES, were found to be at a significantly higher odds for chlamydia infection for one of the four ON-Marg indices; namely, dependency. More research is warranted to further clarify the role of neighbourhood SES on the risk of chlamydia infection.</description>

   <description>Pyrite is an important mineral due to its ability to contain high concentrations of gold. Unfortunately, pyrite does not typically allow for conventional gold leaching, and often an oxidative pre-treatment process must be applied in order to recover the refractory gold. Oxidative pre-treatments exist in a variety of forms categorized under either pyrometallurgical or hydrometallurgical processes. Further hydrometallurgical pre-treatment methods must be investigated in order to meet the current demands of the industry due to the ever changing types of gold deposits. This study investigates the effectiveness of two carbon-based oxidation rate enhancing additives, Lewatit® AF 5, a micro/mesoporous carbonaceous bead, and granular coconut shell activated carbon in the atmospheric oxidation of pyrite and their ability to promote elemental sulphur generation rather than sulphuric acid. Pyrite oxidation in the absence of the carbon additives was 60% after 96 h, with elemental sulphur yields ranging between 16% and 28%. Under the same test conditions, oxidation tests assisted by AF 5 resulted in approximately 96% pyrite oxidation with elemental sulphur yields ranging between 54% and 63%, while activated carbon assisted oxidation reached virtually 100% pyrite oxidation with elemental sulphur yields between 53% and 54%. AF 5 indicated superior mechanical properties and elemental sulphur retention when compared to activated carbon, resulting in its choice for an additional parameters study. Characterization of the two carbon additives indicated the presence of amino acid group L-cystine on AF 5, absent from activated carbon, which was believed to promote the sulphur retention observed with AF 5. Parameters testing indicated that AF 5 was a versatile additive to atmospheric pyrite oxidation as elemental sulphur yield and oxidation was not greatly impacted by varying parameters when AF 5 was present. The highest oxidation and elemental sulphur yields were achieved at a concentrate to carbon additive ratio of 1:2 and a temperature of 90 oC, however. A final study conducted using polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) doped with L-cystine did indicate that L-cystine did enhance elemental sulphur retention, and helps to explain AF 5’s sulphur retention.</description>

   <title>Physical Activity Participation in Ovarian Cancer Survivors: Prevalence, Determinants and Association with Patient Reported Outcomes</title>

   <subject>Patient Reported Outcomes</subject>
   <subject>Prevalence</subject>
   <description>Objectives: The primary objectives were (1) to estimate the prevalence of meeting physical activity (PA) guidelines among ovarian cancer survivors in the post-treatment period and (2) to identify the determinants of meeting PA guidelines in this study population. The secondary objective was to explore the association between PA and patient reported outcomes (PROs), specifically health-related quality of life (HRQOL), anxiety and depression symptoms.&#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: The Lifestyle Habits and the PRognosis of Ovarian Cancer in Quebec (HPROQ) Study is a prospective cohort study that was conducted in Montreal (2015-2018). For this thesis, a cross-sectional study was conducted on the baseline cohort. 112 ovarian cancer survivors were interviewed 6 months after treatment completion. Modified Poisson regression was used to estimate the prevalence ratio (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to describe the association between patient characteristics and the prevalence of meeting PA guidelines. Multivariable linear and logistic regressions were used to examine the association between meeting PA guidelines and PROs. &#xd;
&#xd;
Results: 42.0% (95% CI: 32.8-51.1%) of ovarian cancer survivors met the PA guidelines of at least 150 minutes of moderate PA per week. There was no evidence of a statistically significant association between any of the potential determinants and meeting PA guidelines. Employment had the highest PR, suggesting that women who were employed had a prevalence of meeting PA guidelines that was 1.49 times greater than women who were unemployed (PR=1.49; 95% CI:0.87-2.55). There was no statistical evidence of an association between meeting PA guidelines and better HRQOL or reduced anxiety and depressive symptoms. PA was most protective for depressive symptoms, suggesting that women who met PA guidelines had odds of depressive symptoms that were 0.30 times greater than women who did not meet PA guidelines. &#xd;
&#xd;
Conclusions: The prevalence of meeting PA guidelines 6 months after treatment was higher than reported in previous studies. None of the potential determinants were significantly associated with meeting PA guidelines, nor was meeting PA guidelines significantly associated with improved PROs. Due to the small sample size the study was underpowered, making it difficult to exclude chance as an explanation for some of the more suggestive associations observed in this thesis.</description>

   <subject>Munsee Dealware Lunaape Indigenous Language Revitalization Levelled Readers</subject>
   <description>Since the arrival of the Europeans in North America, languages spoken by First Peoples have struggled for survival. Widespread conflict and disease significantly reduced the numbers of language speakers. Government action, in form of treaties, the Indian Act, residential schooling and official languages (French and English) further reduced the ability for First Peoples to maintain and converse in their original language.&#xd;
Lunaape (Munsee or Delaware) language use has been reduced to less than 75 speakers who have varying ability to converse in written and oral form. The language exists in my community, Munsee-Delaware First Nation, only with second-language learners. Community members can access the language through community classes, daycare, elementary school, and a course at Western University. Research regarding first- and second-language acquisition and revitalization has been well documented. Best practices include full immersion programs, the use of multimedia, and social media, language nests, language camps and, above all, community support.&#xd;
Inspired by the work of Restoule, Gruner, and Metatawabin (2013), I want to promote second-language reading with strong community connections on Munsee-Delaware First Nation. As with Restoule et al. (2013), this will come through personal story, culture, traditional practices, and language. Important, as well, is the engagement of community members in sharing their knowledge and willingness to “re-learn” the language. These connections will support building relevance in language revitalization for community members.&#xd;
Important for use is the relevance of language to the community members and ultimately community learners. According to by Baloy (2011), engaging language learners today involves a multi-level approach that incorporates technology, social media, and applications. While maintaining traditional learning by face-to-face interaction and print media, it is important to include new methods of student engagement in order that community members see the language in “modern” use.&#xd;
My proposed project is to create levelled readers to promote reading in Lunaape, thus honouring my community’s unique geographical location and environment. From these readers, my hope is to create a starting point for community members to engage with language both for community classes and in local provincial schools.</description>

   <title>Hydrogen Gas Production and Effects During Remediation Using Nano-scale Zero-valent Iron</title>

   <subject>Nano-Scale Zero-Valent Iron</subject>
   <subject>Hydrogen Gas Exsolution</subject>
   <description>The objective of this study was to develop an understanding of the potential effects of hydrogen gas (H2) exsolution during nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) groundwater remediation applications. An improved understanding of gas exsolution and its effects can be applied to remediation technologies that produce gas in excess of solubility limits, including bioremediation and nZVI. Experiments were performed in thin flow cells packed with water- saturated silica sands.&#xd;
Differential pressure measurements were taken under saturated conditions, after H2 gas exsolution and during gas dissolution. Images were processed with a quantitative light transmission technique to visualize and quantify gas production and transport, and to investigate flow diversion around the injection zone. In a larger-scale experiment, images were processed qualitatively to visualize gas production and transport, and to investigate flow diversion around the injection zone. Water samples were collected and analyzed for contaminant mobilization and redistribution to upper portions of the flow cell. The exsolution of H2 gas caused reductions in hydraulic conductivity with lower values associated with higher gas saturations. Images obtained from dye tests in all experiments demonstrated significant reduction in hydraulic conductivity due to H2 gas produced, with flow diversion of dye solution around the injection zone. The study demonstrated that the dissolution of exsolved gas can be used to investigate relative permeability at small saturation increments and at lower trapped gas saturations than can be obtained using external displacement experiments. H2 gas exsolved due to the reaction of nZVI with water was greater than the H2 gas produced by the self- hydrolysis of NaBH4 solution injected into saturated sands, despite using similar NaBH4 concentration as excess for nZVI synthesis. In the large-scale experiment, the exsolved H2 gas volume was sufficient to produce trapped gas in the injection area, and gas that travelled upwards and away from the injection area as gas channels. Vertical gas transport occurred above a high-concentration trichloroethene (TCE) plume, resulting in its redistribution of TCE, as well as ethene and ethane transport along the gas channel fronts.</description>

   <description>Phenotypic plasticity of human arterial smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) allows them to transition from a “contractile/quiescent” state, in which they regulate arterial tone and blood pressure, to one in which these cells are more “synthetic/activated”. Synthetic/activated HASMCs are migratory and proliferative, and these capabilities allow them to participate in vasculogenesis during development, as well as post-natal vessel repair. Although several laboratories have investigated the overall inhibitory influence of cAMP-elevating agents on HASMC migration, few have addressed whether cAMP signalling also coordinates HASMC invasion of extracellular matrices, a critical first step in HASMC migration in vivo. Indeed, while several cAMP-elevating agents reduce intimal hyperplasia/hypertrophy in animal models, it is presently unclear whether these effects are due to reduced matrix invasion of these cells or solely to inhibition of their migratory capacity. Previous work conducted by our group and others have identified the critical role of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 1C (PDE1C) in HASMC migration, proliferation, and extracellular matrix adhesion. Here, we directly tested the hypothesis that cAMP signaling, and specifically PDE1C, influences the ability of activated/synthetic HASMCs to invade matrix in 3-dimensions (3D) and show that this effect is distinct from their migratory actions. Overall, we observed that inhibiting PDE1C activity reduced invasion of 3D collagen matrices by these cells to a greater degree than it did migration in systems not requiring invasion. Using a spheroid model, it was found that either inhibition of PDE1, or the selective silencing of PDE1C, reduced the distance of sprout outgrowth. Of importance in assessing how PDE1C regulates matrix invasion, we investigated whether HASMCs invading collagen matrices generated matrix degrading structures, specifically podosomes. Our data, although preliminary, is consistent with this idea. Similarly, initial success at generating mixed spheroids of human endothelial and SMCs cultures is presented. In these latter experiments, we used telomerase immortalized human aortic endothelial cells (TeloHAECs). This work reports that inhibiting or silencing HASMC PDE1C preferentially impacts invasion over migration of these cells. This aids in bridging the gap between in vitro and in vivo effects of PDE1C, and in HASMC evaluation of its potential as a therapeutic target.</description>

   <description>Highly mobile landslides can have devastating impacts on infrastructure and human life.  In order to mitigate the risks of these landslides, it is critical to understand how they are triggered and the mechanism behind their high mobility.  The objective of this research is to investigate the initiation and propagation of liquefaction and the resultant flow mobility due to static triggering in loose granular slopes using two physical modelling techniques. The first experiment used geotechnical centrifuge techniques to determine the velocity of the liquefaction propagation in saturated granular slopes for loose and dense soils, by varying the thickness and void ratios of the materials. The results of these tests indicate that all model slopes which were loose of the critical state were highly liquefiable upon shearing, while all dense tests resisted liquefaction and instead were subject to erosion as they could withstand much higher seepage flow rates. Tests that experienced liquefaction reveal that the velocity of the liquefaction propagation is not dependent on the velocity of shearing of the initial failure (0.25-0.5 m/s), and that the speed of propagation of the liquefaction front can happen at an order of magnitude faster than that of the initial triggering event (4.2-4.3 m/s). A second series of experiments was performed to develop testing techniques and best practices for dam breach experiments using a large-scale flume.  In this test series, both saturated fine sand and coarse grained material were examined.  Results from testing the saturated coarse grained material show that landslide mobility increases with respect to dry flow when the material is saturated. As expected, the increase in mobility with the addition of water is due to the proportional decrease in basal shear resistance. In contrast, the same experiment with fine sand did not experience failure and most of the material remained in the release box. This surprising finding indicates the possible significant role of air entry and matric suction on the higher strength in the latter case and indicates an interesting avenue for future research to quantify this phenomena.</description>

   <description>The Etruscans are described by Roman and Greek sources as a people devoted to religious practices above any other. A facet of Etruscan religion is divination, a field in which they had a reputation for excellence in ancient Italy. This caused many Etruscan priests to be summoned to Rome to explain phenomena that local experts could not. The Romans turned to the practices of the Etruscan haruspices as a way to provide a procuration or a way to “find remedies” for the disturbances between man and the gods. &#xd;
For the purpose of this paper, the focus will be on Etruscan religion. Main points of discussion will include: 1) where our understanding of Etruscan religion stems from and an overview of the foundations of Etruscan Religion; 2) the Etruscan pantheon and the features distinguishing the Etruscan gods from the Greek and Roman gods; 3) divination and haruspicy in Etruria. For all three subjects archaeological evidence will be presented. A catalogue of select artifacts associated primarily with divination provides additional material in support of the discussion.</description>

   <description>N-Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are excellent ligands for metal coordination and have been studied extensively. NHC metal complexes have also been used for many different catalytic applications. One such application of these complexes is their use in water oxidation catalysis as described by Albrecht. In Chapter 2 we will discuss the progress made in tethering water oxidation catalysts to gold surfaces via NHC self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). This project bridges the gap between NHCs for surface science applications and for homogeneous catalysis. Two main routes were explored for this project to immobilize an iridium-based water oxidation catalyst. The catalyst was synthesized either on or off of the NHC SAM support. Several generations of the catalysts were tested for catalytic activity for water oxidation catalysis and this too will be discussed in Chapter 2.&#xd;
	Recently it has been shown by the Crudden group and others that NHCs are excellent surface ligands with high stability for Au(111). The preparation of these materials have recently improved using simple benchtop methods, which will be discussed in Chapter 3, instead of generating the free carbene using strong base and inert atmosphere. Hydrogen carbonate salts of NHC precursors were used to deposit an NHC SAM on Au(111) in situ with HPLC methanol. These films were found to have the same characteristics and stability as those deposited using the free carbene. In Chapter 3 we also describe the use of other azolium salts with non-coordinating counterions to deposit NHC SAMs on Au(111) without the need to create the hydrogen carbonate salts. This simplifies the benchtop method even further as ion exchange reactions are no longer necessary for NHC SAM deposition.</description>

   <title>What's odd? Cognitive processing of social contexts based on autistic traits within the general population</title>

   <description>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social and communicative deficits, such as being able to identify and understand a joke. These social deficits can be understood in a cognitive framework; smaller differences in perceptual processing can snowball into tangible larger differences in complex and dynamic social situations (Benson, Castelhano, Howard, Latif &amp; Rayner, 2016; Minshew &amp; Goldstein, 1998). For example, individuals with ASD have a greater difficulty with tasks requiring higher-order or complex cognitive processing (Minshew &amp; Goldstein, 1998; Benson et al., 2016). The present study extends prior research examining ASD-like cognitive processing styles in non-clinical individuals by examining how different levels of ASD-like traits in the general population can affect perception of social contexts (Baron-Cohen et al., 2001; Bayliss &amp; Tipper, 2006; Ruzich et al., 2015). ASD-like traits were measured by the Autism Quotient (AQ; Baron-Cohen et al., 2001). Participants completed a visual/social oddity task that varied on whether complex or simple processing of a visual scene was required. Scenes could be visually odd (e.g., girl with a vase as a “third leg,” which requires simple re-parsing of visual features, or socially odd (e.g., a man walking a lettuce on a leash), which requires integration of past knowledge of social norms. If ASD-like traits are linked with impaired complex but not simple processing we expect people with high ASD-like traits to show differing eye movement patterns for socially odd (complex) but not visually odd (simple) stimuli, with no differences for those with low traits. No significant interactions or main effects were found for differing levels of ASD-like traits.</description>

   <description>This thesis employs an innovative methodological approach to provide a historical geography of the Frontenac Arch Biosphere Reserve (FABR), an area designated by the United Nations’ Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization’s Man and the Biosphere (MAB) program. Through a walking research method conducted in five hiking locations within the FABR, I identified important themes and current issues related to the key concepts used to define and understand biosphere reserves; ecology, ecosystem, conservation, and sustainable development and followed them back through the institutional history of MAB. By attending to the complexity of meanings held by each of the key concepts, the research seeks to identify moments of possibility within MAB’s past for promoting the FABR's purpose as a site of socio-ecological learning. These moments are at risk of being forgotten as social issues are generally overshadowed by a focus on economic development within the World Network of Biosphere Reserves. The research presented here provides important historical and political context to help situate the current approach to sustainable development at the FABR by attending to three other overlapping institutional temporal scales centered around the following key events: the creation of UNESCO and its conservation organizations from 1929-1969; the planning and implementation of the MAB program from 1968-2000; and finally, the implementation of Canada’s national MAB program from 1972-2000. The key contributions of this work include a historical geographical methodology that blends embodied walking research with archival inquiry, a summary of resources from MAB’s history for biosphere reserve practitioners in Canada who are working towards building positive cross-cultural relationships with Indigenous individuals and organizations, and the documentation of key insights from MAB’s history related to ongoing efforts in the discipline of geography to a meaningful integration of the human and physical sciences.</description>

   <description>Smallmouth Bass (Micropterus dolomieu) are one of the most popular species targeted by angling tournaments in North America, particularly in the Great Lakes region. Tournament anglers target the largest fish in these populations and can transport them across great distances (>100 km), generating concern among scientists and anglers about their ability to return to their established home ranges. Understanding the movement of sport fish by tournament anglers can aid in managing the large recreational fishery that exists in the Great Lakes region. Currently, there is insufficient research examining the natural movements or long-distance displacement of bass within large waterbodies. This study investigates tournament displacement within the Eastern Basin and the natural, non-displaced, movements of these fish. A dataset (2012 – 2016) of externally tagged Smallmouth Bass was used to examine movement, both natural and post-tournament displacement. In addition, acoustic telemetry was used to monitor the movements of an experimentally displaced and non-displaced group. From initial tagging to recapture, experimentally tagged displaced fish travelled an average of 23.4 km, while the control group travelled an average of 2.91 km. Both groups had similar lengths of time between tagging and recapture. The acoustically tagged control group were frequently detected within their initial tagging site, suggesting these fish maintain home ranges similar in size with Smallmouth Bass inhabiting smaller waterbodies. Both experimental groups displayed varying movement throughout the Eastern Basin, suggesting that many of these fish may be searching for pre-established home-ranges. No acoustically tagged fish displaced within the Eastern Basin returned to their original area of capture, suggesting they experienced difficulty navigating. These results have very important implications for fisheries managers, as well as organizers of competitive angling events for bass in the Great Lakes.</description>

   <description>This work presents a new type of nano-plasmonic sensor based on crossed surface relief gratings (CSRGs) with gradually varying pitch generated on top an azobenzene thin films using a 532 nm laser and a modified Lloyd mirror setup. A cylindrical lens is placed in front of half of the beam’s path, scattering the light horizontally, which results in the varying pitch linear gratings. Crossed gratings are created by writing a varying pitch grating on top of an orthogonally placed constant linear grating; therefore, producing a chirped-pitch cross grating. CSRGs have already created a unique surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors, since no light passes through them except a narrow bandwidth where SPR conversion occurs. A large bandwidth of SPR wavelengths are excitable along the chirped grating, making them suitable as a new generation of biosensor that obtains an accurate signal using multiple wavelengths of light upon a biological or biochemical event. Alternatively, the sensor can be divided up to different sections, where each section could be used as a device by itself, with specific photonic characteristics, that can be tailored for multiple, specific, biosensing requirements.</description>

   <description>Calpains are multi-domain intracellular Ca2+-activated cysteine proteases. They participate in a number of cellular processes downstream of calcium signaling. Unregulated calpain activity, caused by a loss of calcium homeostasis, has been implicated in a variety of pathologies. For that reason, studying calpain structure-function is of great biomedical interest. Nevertheless, some fundamental questions regarding the behaviors of these proteases remain unanswered largely due to the low sensitivity and poor calpain-specificity of the current methods to measure calpain activity. To address this deficiency, we designed, characterized and optimized a fluorescent protein-based FRET substrate centered on the highly calpain-sensitive PLFAAR cleavage sequence. This reagent proved superior to the endogenous substrate α-spectrin both in vitro and in vivo, making it feasible to accurately determine when, where, and under what circumstances calpain is activated in cells. This substrate may also be useful for the identification of relevant calpain substrates and the assessment of calpain-specific inhibitors in vivo. &#xd;
	Calpain-3 is a tissue-enriched isoform whose loss of function causes limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Due to its instability, largely conferred by its unique insertion sequences, recombinant expression of the full-length enzyme has not been possible. To study the function of insertion sequence one (IS1), we designed and characterized a recombinant calpain-2 surrogate with IS1 inserted into the protease core in its calpain-3-equivalent position. As it does in calpain-3, IS1 occupied the catalytic cleft of the surrogate, restricting access of substrates and inhibitors, establishing its propeptide potential. Surprisingly, the natural calpain inhibitor calpastatin was able to displace IS1 from the active-site and block protease activity. However, this is unlikely to occur in vivo because calpain-3 homodimerizes and presents only one set of PEF domains to hold calpastatin via its anchoring subdomains. We also characterized a protease core from human calpain-3 missing IS1, which showed that IS1 autoinhibition accounts for a nearly 2-fold loss in enzyme activity. Despite the sequence and structural similarities of this protease core with that of calpain-1, small-molecule calpain inhibitors were less effective on this isoform, suggesting that subtle differences in the subsites of the calpain-3 catalytic cleft may confer sufficient isoform-specificity for the development of relatively calpain-3-specific inhibitors.</description>

   <description>After nearly eight years of formal environmental review, in July 2016, the Canadian federal government rejected the French multinational AREVA’s proposal to construct a uranium mine 80 kilometers west of Qamani’tuaq/Baker Lake, a small inland and mainly Inuit hamlet in the Kivalliq region of Nunavut. The decision not to grant a license for resource development was based on a technical uncertainty, that is, AREVA was not able to provide a start-date for the mining project due to the depressed uranium market. Yet, as this thesis will demonstrate, this controversy underlies a far more complex and ongoing negotiation with uncertainty. In order to explore diverging engagements with uncertainty, this thesis develops the concept of sites of uncertainty, which are spaces —physical, temporal, emotional, material, discursive and so on—that are occupied by a “state of not knowing” (Cameron, 2015: 34). Drawing on qualitative fieldwork conducted in Baker Lake in November and December of 2016, this thesis will identify key sites of uncertainty where AREVA, government officials, Inuit organizations, and community residents constructed, negotiated, expressed, transformed, experienced, and responded to uncertainty. The analysis of these sites reveals diverse, dynamic, and conflicting conceptualizations of self-sufficiency, well-being, and ultimately identity, which, this thesis argues, led to muddy responses to AREVA’s proposal as well as imagined futures of Baker Lake. Moreover, this thesis explains how local residents’ calls for improvements in education are reflective of an intermeshing of Inuit and western epistemologies. While Inuit ways of knowing and being have persisted, flourished, and creatively adapted to contemporary resource development controversies, they do so largely by conforming to western norms and knowledge systems.</description>

   <subject>Switched-Capacitor Converters</subject>
   <description>Switched-capacitor (SC) power converters are a class of converters comprised entirely of capacitors and switches. These converters contain no bulky magnetic components and are well suited for miniaturization and silicon integration. In this thesis, a comprehensive framework for the design and analysis of efficient, high-performance switched-capacitor DC-DC converters is presented. A precise, curvature-based averaged modelling technique is first proposed. The generalized technique provides a complete characterization of the converter at all steady-state operating conditions. From this model, a simple and accurate expression for the output impedance is derived. The technique is applied on a number of SC converter topologies and compared with existing steady-state models. An approach to model the dynamic behaviour of SC converters based on the generalized state-space averaging method is also described and demonstrated on a conventional SC converter. Furthermore, a procedure to determine the attainable ideal conversion ratios of any SC converter structure is presented. This procedure is applied on a generalized SC structure and the performance limits of multiphase switched-capacitor DC-DC converters are examined. Based on these results, a novel multiphase SC converter structure with variable-gain is proposed. The converter utilizes an optimized switching configuration with an increased number of attainable ideal conversion ratios, for the given number of capacitors and phases. This property allows the converter to maintain high efficiency across a wide range of operating conditions while reducing size, cost and switching losses. Finally, an integrated implementation of the proposed SC converter is designed, analyzed, and tested. The converter generates a regulated 3.3 V output from a 2.6–5.5 V input at up to 165 mA of output current and is fabricated using 0.35 µm CMOS technology. Details on the implementation are provided, including methods to drive and control the integrated converter. The simulated and experimentally measured performance of the circuit is presented and compared with existing converters.</description>

   <description>This dissertation portfolio provides a focused—albeit methodologically diverse—review of research ethics in the context of participatory art, including research-creation and social art practices. Focusing on a case of intense ethical demand involving the creative representation of people who are making asylum and refugee claims, this project makes a unique contribution to research on research ethics as it applies to arts-based projects. This portfolio includes a set of stand-alone manuscripts linked by creative texts that situate the work in both creative and theoretical contexts. The manuscripts include a critical review of the development of research ethics review processes for research-creation in Canada; a commentary on aesthetic approaches to ethics in participatory art following the ethical turn in philosophy; and an artist statement for a new and ongoing research-creation project called Reading the Migration Library. The poetic and hybrid-form texts that are interwoven with the manuscripts situate the work in the context of Indigenous resurgence inside of academia, leading up to and following the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada and concomitant with recent revelations of research misconduct directly affecting Indigenous communities and individuals. Using alternate forms of academic writing including poetry and autoethnography, this portfolio is a contribution to methodological experimentation in cultural studies and arts-based research. The multiple methods employed demonstrate how critical and creative researchers’ ethical engagement in settings of intense ethical demand is deepened and enhanced through methodological antecedents including disjunctures, epistolary and first-person forms, genealogy, place-based theories, refusal, relationality, and strategic silences. The fieldwork, including Reading the Migration Library, was completed during 2016 and 2017 with artists and arts organizers associated with the Immigration/Emigration artists-in-residence program of Santa Fe Art Institute in New Mexico. The research also included partnership with cultural groups in the cities of New Westminster and Vancouver in British Columbia.</description>

   <title>A Field and Numerical Study of Heat and Solute Transport in a Discrete Fracture</title>

   <description>Two tracer experiments were conducted in a highly-transmissive discrete rock fracture to explore the transport properties of solute and heat, and the influence of fracture heterogeneities. The experiments were conducted between two boreholes located approximately 10 m apart in a granitic gneiss. The discrete fracture used for the experiments was identified from prior pulse interference testing and geophysical logging. Test sections were minimized in both boreholes to isolate the discrete feature. Heat and solute tracers were applied simultaneously in the same divergent flow field developed by injecting water (6-10 Lpm). Both solute and thermal breakthrough were observed with peak arrival within ½ hour for solute and within two hours for heat. Based on the analytical analysis of pulse interference tests that were conducted prior to the experiments (in the same test section), hydraulic conditions measured during the experiments, and the results of the solute breakthroughs, a complicated fracture geometry with channelized flow was suggested. Numerical analysis conducted with uniform aperture and a radial flow field did not fit either of the tracers, so variable aperture configurations were investigated. Channelized flow fields with variable aperture provided reasonable fits for both solute and heat breakthrough curves. The tracers, however, were fit using different fracture geometry. The best fit for the heat tracer was achieved using a 0.2 m-wide channel with a 4.0 mm aperture and an unrealistic matrix thermal conductivity of 28 W/mK. The best fit for the solute tracer was achieved using a 5 m-wide channel, 1.4 mm aperture and a longitudinal dispersivity of 1 m. Both fits were achieved with similar hydraulic head rises to those measured during the field experiments. The substantial difference in flow geometry, and the need to use an unrealistic thermal conductivity is not easily attributed to any known feature of the flow system.</description>

   <description>This paper begins by analyzing Richard Schechner’s distinguishing features of ritual and theatrical performances, specifically regarding audience participation, audience belief, and intention of the performance to determine if these are truly accurate predictors of ritual and theatre. Specifically, the question of “belief” is raised.  The ways in which audiences suspend disbelief in different types of performances is questioned and alternative ways of approaching (dis)belief in performance theory are proposed. Schechner’s efficacy/entertainment theory is updated using affect theory and performative utterances, thereby bringing emotional immediacy and authenticity into Schechner’s model. Building from the emotional significance of different performance types, this thesis posits that the lasting effects of ritual and theatre differ due to the disparity between the respective emotional affects of ritual and theatre performances. The research suggests that in some cases, ritual performance has the power to indoctrinate audiences that theatrical performance usually does not. The Eight Model Plays of Cultural Revolution China and City Christian Church Toronto’s baptism and Sunday service rituals serve as case studies through which this expanded theory of performance is tested.</description>

   <title>Soil from the Yellowknife, NT Region: Spatial Distribution of Arsenic, Characterization of Solid Phase Arsenic Hosts, and Distinguishing Giant and Con Mine Contamination</title>

   <description>Historical gold mining in the Yellowknife, Northwest Territories region has led to a legacy of arsenic contamination in the region. Roasting of arsenopyrite hosting gold ore released arsenic trioxide (As2O3) via airborne emissions. Recent studies have highlighted the persistence of As2O3 in local sediments and surface waters. However, questions remain regarding the regional extent and nature of arsenic in soils from the region. The main objective of this research is to report the concentration and speciation of arsenic in 311 near-surface soil samples collected within 30 km of Yellowknife. Soil samples were cored from locations that were undisturbed by recent human activities to minimize the influence of recent post-mining activities and to examine the effect of natural processes and the legacy of airborne emissions from former ore roasting. Analyses in this study focused on the Public Health Layer (PHL), which is defined as the top 5 cm of material. The arsenic concentrations for the region varied widely, ranging from 1.0 to 4,700 mg/kg. Statistical analysis indicates the distance from former ore roasters, soil horizon depth, terrain unit, and the relative direction the sample was collected from Giant Mine are the most significant factors on arsenic concentrations in the PHL. The dominant arsenic species in the soil samples are roaster-derived iron oxides containing arsenic, As2O3, and natural iron oxides. Of the samples completed for detailed mineralogy, 57% (n = 44) of samples analyzed contain 80% or greater anthropogenic arsenic (i.e. a combination of roaster-derived iron oxides and arsenic trioxide). These data suggest the current background arsenic value of 150 mg/kg (GNWT, 2003), which is over 12 times the Canadian Environmental Quality Guideline of 12 mg/kg for soil (CCME, 2015), should be revisited. Additionally, the remediation guidelines of 160 and 340 mg/kg for residential and industrial areas, respectively, (GNWT, 2003) should also be revisited. This study provides data that can support future risk assessments to human and ecological health from arsenic-derived stack emissions.</description>

Enzymes PigC and TamQ are responsible for the final step in prodiginine and tambjamine biosynthesis respectively, involving the coupling of a product specific intermediate to the shared intermediate 4-methoxy-2,2’-bipyrrole-5-carbaldehyde. Previous investigations have focused solely on PigC and have not successfully purified the enzyme, inciting the use of crude cell lysate to test enzyme activity. The objectives of this research were to directly compare the kinetic characteristics and substrate selectivity of PigC and TamQ. PigC was cloned from Pseudoalteromonas rubra, a known producer of several prodiginine analogues. TamQ was cloned from Pseudoalteromonas citrea, which is predicted to produce tambjamine YP1 based on genomic mining. PigC and TamQ were successfully heterologously expressed and purified, and enzymatic activities of both PigC and TamQ were reconstituted with their native and pseudo-native substrates. The true kinetic parameters of two substrates for PigC were determined, allowing for prediction of the reaction sequence and a proposed Ter Bi Ping Pong enzyme system. PigC also demonstrated some substrate flexibility by accepting a synthetic halogenated analogue in addition to its natural substrate 2-methyl-3-amyl-pyrrole (MAP). Apparent kinetic values for TamQ were obtained using a close analogue of its native substrate. Additionally, the enzyme could accept and turnover the PigC substrate MAP, though, the structure of the reaction product has yet to be determined. Three other biosynthetic enzymes involved in tambjamine YP1 (TamA, TamT, and TamH) construction were cloned from P. citrea and expressed for future functionality studies. Lastly, a novel cyclized variant of tambjamine YP1 was isolated from P. citrea. The complete structure of this compound was determined by NMR and X-ray crystallography analysis.</description>

   <title>Europe in Hard Times: Institutional Reconfiguration in the European Union since the 2008 Great Recession</title>

   <description>The 2008 Great Recession was the trigger for the first real stress test of the European Monetary Union. The eurozone and the European Union were faced with a succession of three crises: financial, banking, and sovereign debt. Faced with the real possibility of the exit of multiple members, or the complete implosion of the common currency; members-states undertook the biggest economic institutional change since the Treaty of Maastricht. Briefly: in spite of the negative media, political and academic coverage, how can we explain that the EU responses to the euro area and to the banking and sovereign debt crisis were not only to keep the union intact, but to reinforce and expand the Europeanization process?&#xd;
To make sense of the institutional outcomes of the crisis, I borrow from the approach of Peter Gourevitch in his classic Politics in Hard Times. Hard times are a catalyst for institutional change. During a crisis, the various actors enter a period of flux where the existing coalitions are subject to a realignment. The actors involved have a range of policy choices to come to terms with the crisis. These options are shaped by the institutional legacy, and by the specifics of the coalition realignment. When the crisis is resolved or when the crisis fades out, the new coalitions crystallize and they remain in place during easier times. While Gourevitch applied his framework to societal groups within a state, I bring my analysis to the second level and I look at coalitions of member-states within the European Union. In this dissertation, I argue that the international economic context of the crisis created a period of flux where existing coalitions of member-states in Europe broke down. During the crisis, new coalitions emerged along the debtor-creditor axis. The range of policy options are arranged along a security-solidarity axis. Coalitions had to enter into negotiations and the results of these negotiations are the EFSF, ESM, Six-Pack and Two-Pack, and the banking union. Between the five of them, they are the solutions to the problems created by the financial, banking, and sovereign debt crises.</description>

   <title>Sleep Contributions to Hippocampal Gist Extraction</title>

   <description>To better understand the world, humans scan the information contents of our experiences for patterns, corresponding to the extraction of gist, or essential meaning (Brainerd &amp; Reyna, 1990). Research suggests that some forms of gist extraction require several hours, and even sleep for further processing (Ellenbogen et al., 2007; Payne et al., 2009), perhaps becoming subsequently reactivated in the hippocampus (Marshall &amp; Born, 2007). Interestingly, the hippocampus may itself be functionally specialized for gist extraction in its anterior segment (Poppenk et al., 2013). The current study investigated the role of the anterior/posterior hippocampus and sleep stages in predicting patterns of change in gist memory over the course of a week. To assess this link, I identified four types of gist (inferential, statistical, multi-item, and single-item) that were described in recent reviews (Landmann et al., 2014; Stickgold &amp; Walker, 2013). 104 participants were recruited, 67 of whom passed eligibility criteria and completed three behavioural sessions (evening before sleep, 12 hours later in the morning after sleep, and one week after the first session) and an MRI several weeks later as part of a broader battery of tasks. I found evidence that inferential gist in a transitive inference task increased over time, suggesting that new information is being formed. I also found that REM, rather than slow-wave sleep, predicted gist extraction in a number of different tasks. Lastly, hippocampal volumes predicted immediate rather than delayed gist extraction.</description>

   <subject>Data Use</subject>
   <subject>Board Improvement Plans</subject>
   <subject>Ontario School Boards</subject>
   <description>Board improvement plans (BIP) are documents which include goals and actions to improve student achievement and well-being within a school board. School boards in Ontario are encouraged to use data to make informed educational decisions about their students, educators, and schools to improve education. However, how data are used in board improvement planning is unknown. The purpose of this research is to explore the role of data in board improvement planning to gain an understanding of how data are used at the board level of the Ontario school system. To understand the role of data at the board level, the main research question is: What is the role of data in board improvement planning? &#xd;
&#xd;
Data were collected from three sources for this exploratory case study: three principal interviews, document analysis of relevant Ministry documents, and document analysis of 18 BIPs. Interviews were inductively coded and used to deductively analyze Ministry documents. BIPs were analyzed following the iterative process of skimming, reading, and interpretation using elements of content and thematic analysis. &#xd;
&#xd;
The three themes discovered during interview analysis and used to explore Ministry documents were: functional development of BIPs, relational aspect of BIPs, and data path in BIPs. From document analysis, four broad types of data were found: board-wide student achievement data, board-wide student well-being data, school level data, and classroom level student data. With respect to the uses of data, data were used to identify, plan, and monitor. Lastly, data were found to be interpreted by examining trends (deconstructing and comparing) and through triangulation (multiple sources and in teams). In conclusion, the results provide evidence that multiple types of data are being used for board improvement planning, for various different uses, with different ways of interpreting the data.</description>

   <description>The objective of this thesis is to explore new applications of inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). &#xd;
1.	The first application involved the development of a method for the direct bulk analysis of a 12 M KOH zincate electrolyte fuel, which is used for green energy backup systems. By using flow injection analysis in combination with an inert sample introduction system, the concentrations of additives (Al, Fe, Mg, In, Si) and corrosion products (Zn2+ and CO32-) were quantified. However, accurate determination of all elemental concentrations was unsuccessful due to suppression from the matrix. &#xd;
2.	The second application focused on exploring and enhancing the capabilities of single particle ICP-OES analysis for the characterization of the particles filtered from the 12 M KOH zincate electrolyte fuel. A conventional pure argon plasma and Ar-N2-N2/H2 mixed gas plasma were compared with regards to sensitivity, detection limit, and robustness to establish which operating conditions minimize the detectable particle mass. The effect of infrared heating the sample aerosol in the spray chamber and base of the torch was explored to increase transport efficiency and reduce the noise arising from aerosol processing within the plasma that would degrade detectable particle mass. Two surfactants were also explored to stabilize and disperse particles in solution.</description>

   <description>This dissertation examines the ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front’s construction and deployment of political rhetoric and symbols as key facets of authoritarian resilience and ethnic ‘control’ in post-genocide Rwanda. It identifies four overlapping and mutually reinforcing rhetorical ‘pillars’ that comprise Rwanda’s ‘public relations machine.’ These include: historical closure, and the promotion of a singular ‘Truth’; neo-traditionalism, and the ‘revival’ of pre-colonial values and practices to shape notions of model citizenship; national unity and reconciliation, and the ‘restoration’ of a unifying Rwandan identity; and economic development in line with the ‘Singaporean miracle’. Relatedly, the dissertation scrutinizes how the PR machine weaves together these pillars to craft a narrative of Rwanda’s recovery that reproduces power at home, and generates support for regime persistence abroad, despite the government of Rwanda’s questionable human rights record, authoritarian tendencies, and entrenched (albeit veiled) structures of ethnic domination. In addition to ‘building’ the PR machine, the dissertation also examines whether its content and deployment has shifted during the RPF’s nearly 25-years in power. It finds a striking continuity in the RPF’s rhetorical universe during ‘normal’ and emergency periods, the main difference being the regime’s ‘securitization’ of its rhetorical repertoire during ‘episodes of contestation’, while defining itself as the true guardian of public order.&#xd;
 &#xd;
From a theoretical perspective, the dissertation contributes to a burgeoning comparative literature on authoritarian durability by presenting Rwanda as an example of resilient ‘hegemonic authoritarianism’ and ethnic ‘control’, and by treating rhetorical displays of power as central to political processes rather than epiphenomenal. In this way, the dissertation also distinguishes itself from Ian Lustick’s classical account of ‘control’, which ignores the central role of legitimation discourse as a key endurance tool. Finally, by exploring (dis)continuities in regime rhetoric over time, the dissertation contributes to a small body of literature on rhetorical path dependency, which focuses on established democracies. My initial analysis of Rwanda suggests that autocrats, like democratic leaders, may suffer high costs when they deviate from an established rhetorical path, meaning that words, like institutions, are often ‘sticky.’ This renders wholesale transformations in publically-deployed ideology unlikely, especially when a regime experiences positive gains.</description>

   <title>On the Detectability of Density Distributions of Asteroids and SAGD Reservoirs Using Gravimetry and MUON Tomography</title>

   <description>In this thesis, the procedures of modelling density distributions for different targets are investigated. In the process of evaluating density distributions of asteroids, gravity forward modelling shows that homogeneous and heterogeneous distributions are distinguishable. Also, this study demonstrates that muon tomography forward and inversion modelling of SAGD reservoirs could be used for monitoring fluid migration and bitumen depletion in the subsurface. &#xd;
&#xd;
Two different asteroids and spherical models with homogeneous and heterogeneous density distributions are investigated and the resulting surface gravitational accelerations are calculated. The asteroid forward modelling assists in the analysis of surface gravimetry sensitivity, by studying the heterogeneity of asteroids and surface boulder detectability. Results indicate that asteroids with heterogeneous and homogeneous density distributions are distinguishable. However, a gravimeter with sub-mGal accuracy is needed to sense asteroid surface gravity. Results show that a boulder of 8 m3 causes gravitational accelerations on the order of µGal and is not detectable using gravimetry with sub-mGal accuracy. &#xd;
&#xd;
A real SAGD density model is used at two time steps and forward modelled using muon tomography. This results in maps of opacity and muon count in a 2D plane view of the reservoir. The forward modelled 2D image arrays, used to construct the 2D reservoir plane view at surface, estimate bitumen depletion around wellbores during the raising phase and the spreading phase.  The depletion patterns in the reservoir are studied by testing different arrays of muon sensors in the in-line and cross-line directions. Results show that depletion trends can be resolved with high resolution by using 120 sensors and also when using 60 sensors with a reduced resolution.  In the inversion modeling approach, 3D density change models are estimated using 2D opacity image arrays as observations. The depletion trends around wellbores are determined individually until the reservoir reaches the spreading phase when depletion areas become interconnected.</description>

   <description>Oxidative stress causes tissue damage in several models of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and in age-related Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We have developed a novel oxidative stress-based mouse model of age-related cognitive impairment based on gene deletion of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2). ALDH2 is important for the detoxification of endogenous aldehydes such as 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), a lipid peroxidation product formed during oxidative stress that can form protein adducts, altering cell function. These mice exhibit age-related decreases in performance in recognition and spatial memory tasks beginning at 3 months of age and maximal at 6-7 months as well as changes in anxiety-like behavior. These changes are not a result of confounding changes in motor function or physical phenotype. Executive dysfunction, an early impairment seen in VCI, has also been exhibited in Aldh2-/- mice as demonstrated by a lack of reversal learning in the Morris Water Maze task and impairments in the attentional set shifting task. With respect to vascular pathologies, previous studies found that 9-12-month-old Aldh2-/- mice exhibit aortic endothelial dysfunction, and arterial hypercontractility, HNE adduct formation and age-related amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in cerebral microvessels. Echocardiographic analysis and radiotelemetry indicated diastolic dysfunction, and elevated systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure at 12 months of age in male Aldh2-/- mice. Finally, we have shown that cognitive impairment can be mitigated using three novel therapeutic strategies: an HNE scavenger (AG-01), deuterated polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to slow the lipid peroxidation chain reaction, and 4-methyl-5-(2-(nitrooxy) ethyl) thiazol-3-ium chloride (NMZ) to activate CREB signalling. A validated, oxidative stress-based animal model of cognitive impairment and age-related AD and VCI will allow greater insight into the pathogenesis and molecular/cellular mechanisms of these neurological conditions.</description>

   <description>Boiling Liquid Exploding Vapor Explosion (BLEVE) is one of the most feared accident in the industry. Even though it has been studied for over 6 decades, many safety questions remain poorly answered: what happens if a BLEVE occurs in a congested urban or industrial area? What if a road tanker BLEVE happens on a bridge? These questions require to look closer to the vessel. This work focuses on understanding the physics involved in overpressure generation in the near field surrounding of the vessel, to understand the contribution of the fluid phases (liquid and vapor) in the near-field hazards of a BLEVE. For this purpose, a small scale experimental prototype was designed to reproduce realistic BLEVE failure. Twenty-four propane BLEVEs were performed. A wide range of data was recorded from these tests: blast overpressure all around the vessel, transient pressure inside the vessel, ground loading under the vessel, and high speed imaging through various angles. Results give more insight on the anisotropy of the pressure field around the cylindrical vessel. It also shows a strong dependency between vapor content and maximum overpressure from the lead shock. Moreover, the chronology of the phase change observed through transient pressure measurements show that the main contributor of the maximum overpressure is the vapor phase. The phase change is studied through pressure transient in the vessel and high speed imaging, giving a better understanding of the time scales involved with this phenomenon. Finally, ground loading measurements are analyzed to give insight on the order of magnitude involved in this hazard.</description>

   <title>Making 'Mr. Hockey': Race, Gender, Class, and Nation in Media Representations of Gordie Howe</title>

   <description>In this dissertation I study media representations of Gordie Howe, also known as&#xd;
‘Mr. Hockey,’ who has been an idealized image of a hockey player and a ‘true’ Canadian&#xd;
during the Canadian postwar era. By taking Howe as my subject of research, I investigate&#xd;
the cultural meanings of white hockey playing men and their connection to Canadian&#xd;
national identity. My primary research question is: What can we learn about white&#xd;
masculinity and its persistent centrality to Canadian national identity by looking at cultural&#xd;
representations of Gordie Howe? To address this question, I conducted a discourse analysis&#xd;
of media representations of Howe during his playing career (1946-1980) in order to&#xd;
understand the raced, gendered, and classed processes that perpetually exalt white men&#xd;
like Howe as symbols of a dominant, Anglo Canadian identity. My central argument is that&#xd;
Gordie Howe’s image reproduced discourses of nation, class, gender, and race that&#xd;
positioned white, Anglo Canadian men as naturally ‘civilized’ and superior to women and&#xd;
non-Anglo and/or racialized men, and that his image, therefore, contributed to discursive&#xd;
formations in which white, Anglo masculinity was central to dominant, Anglo Canadian&#xd;
identity in the postwar era. Ultimately, this dissertation demonstrates that it is not ‘natural’&#xd;
or inevitable that white male hockey players like Howe, Wayne Gretzky, and Sidney Crosby&#xd;
continually emerge as powerful representations of dominant, Anglo Canadianness, but that&#xd;
they are products of broader processes of colonialism, patriarchy, racialization and&#xd;
capitalism that have and continue to reproduce hockey players as ‘heroes’ whose&#xd;
whiteness and maleness makes them somehow more Canadian than people who are&#xd;
represented through ‘other’ categories of identity.</description>

   <description>Hydraulic fracturing involves the use of horizontal drilling techniques and high-pressure liquid injections to stimulate the production of natural gas through the resultant micro-fracturing networks in tight formations. Hydraulic fracturing wastewaters (HFWs) often contain a diverse hydrocarbon profile, low molecular weight organic acids, and geogenic inorganic materials (salts) at low pH.&#xd;
&#xd;
The diversity and variation of recalcitrant compounds within HFWs have made them difficult to remediate biologically due to the inhibitory effects imparted on microbial systems. Currently, there is a lack of effective remediation/disposal strategies capable of treating these heterogeneous wastes. This work proposes extractive membrane bioreactors (EMBs) as an innovative HFW treatment method. EMBs operate by selectively separating toxic waste streams from microbial systems preventing inhibition, while simultaneously sequestering and transporting the organic content via thermodynamic partitioning across polymer membranes.&#xd;
&#xd;
Characterization of the suitability of various grades of Hytrel™ polymer tubing for EMB applications was undertaken based on polymer water content, molecular transport/retention, and thermodynamic affinity for a range of putative HFW components including acids, bases, salts, organic acids and other organic species. High water content polymers (=30% equilibrated water) were able to transport ionic species, facilitating the rapid transport of monovalent salts, while low water content polymers did not. A demonstration of the transport/retention capabilities of organic species and ions by low water content Hytrel™ tubing was exploited to concentrate dilute butyric acid, achieving a 220% concentration increase from initial dilute aqueous concentrations through chemical dissociation after 48 hours.&#xd;
&#xd;
An EMB utilizing Hytrel™ 3548 tubing was employed for the biological treatment of frequently occurring, representative hydrophilic and hydrophobic organic contaminants at hyper-saline salt&#xd;
concentrations. A microbial consortium capable of degrading representative HFW compounds (benzene, phenol, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) and acetic acid) was generated and identified using genetic sequencing. EMBs were then operated in both batch and continuous configurations, obtaining 99% biodegradation ofiii benzene and phenol after 72 hours, MEK biodegradation of =96% and acetic acid removal up to its ionization point. Successful treatment of synthetic hydraulic fracturing wastewater demonstrated the effectiveness in utilizing amphiphilic polymers in EMBs when treating complex fluids containing hydrophilic and hydrophobic organic fractions.</description>

   <description>Laser cleaning has been used in the rehabilitation and conservation program of the Canadian Parliament Buildings in order to remove the black crust on sandstone surfaces. This study was carried out to characterize the effect of laser cleaning on sandstone from the Canadian Parliament Buildings. First, characteristics of the sandstone and the black crust itself were studied using microscopy, x-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). Two kinds of sandstone samples, Berea/Ohio sandstone and Nepean sandstone, were taken from the West Block of the Parliament Buildings for testing. The results showed that the black crust was a very thin layer covering the surface of the quartz grains and also filling the gaps between the quartz grains on the surface of the sandstone. The characteristic elements of the black crust were sulfur (S), calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), and lead (Pb). Copper (Cu) and chlorine Cl were detected in some samples. Gypsum in the black crust was confirmed by the back-scattered electron (BSE) images. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy results indicated that the organic materials of the black crust contained hydrocarbon oil. Second, surface morphology and elemental composition before and after laser cleaning were studied by microscopy, XRF, and SEM-EDS. The cleaning effect of three laser cleaning systems was discussed in terms of cleaning effectiveness and damage to the sandstone. The results showed that the black crust on the Berea/Ohio sandstone and the Nepean sandstone can be removed by using the LaserArt-100 Cleaning System, the main focus of the study, but that residues of the black crust were still found on the cleaned surface and caused the color of cleaned surface was darker than the fresh sandstone surface. Gypsum crystals were also identified on the cleaned surfaces. XRF and SEM-EDS results indicated that the characteristic elements of the black crust still existed in the residues. No direct damage was found on the cleaned surface. The results of the RILEM tests showed the water absorption rate of the cleaned Berea/Ohio sandstone was increased significantly after laser cleaning. The water absorption rate of the cleaned Nepean sandstone was a little higher than that of the black crust surface, which was near zero. The sandstone would be vulnerable to weathering caused by water when water absorption rate increased. Therefore, keeping some residues during the laser cleaning would benefit the long-term preservation of the sandstone surface because the residues can prevent water infiltration</description>

   <title>Zinc exposure increases resistance to polymyxins in Pseudomonas aeruginosa through activation of the arn operon and two-component regulatory systems</title>

   <description>Metal cations have long been known to play a role in driving antibiotic resistance.  The metal cation Zn2+ has previously been shown to drive antibiotic resistance in various bacterial species, including the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but never to polymyxins.  Here, we have investigated the effect of ZnCl2 on polymyxin resistance in P. aeruginosa.  Weeklong exposure to 2 mM ZnCl2 elicited thousand-fold increases in polymyxin resistance frequency in P. aeruginosa wild type lab strain K767 and clinical strain K2153, but not wild type lab strain PA14; this effect is Zn-specific and could not be reproduced with MgCl2.  Additionally, this effect appears to be specific to P. aeruginosa, as Zn-driven polymyxin resistance could not be elicited in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strain K1199, nor Escherichia coli strain K193 and K155.  However, ZnCl2-exposed polymyxin-resistant strains did not show increased tolerance to growth in 2mM ZnCl2.  Using knockout strains, the two-component regulatory systems ColRS, PmrAB, and ParRS were found to be necessary for the increase in polymyxin resistance frequency to occur in response to ZnCl2; the arnBCADTEF operon which controls polymyxin resistance is also necessary.  arnB was found to be upregulated 2 to 3-fold in several of the ZnCl2-exposed, polymyxin-resistant mutant strains.  As well, those strains where arnB was upregulated also harboured a parR point mutation, suggesting this mutation may be responsible for polymyxin resistance.  Using a parR knockout strain, ParR was found to be necessary for the upregulation of arnB by Zn.  Overall, these data suggest that ZnCl2 plays an important role in driving polymyxin resistance in P. aeruginosa.</description>

   <description>Starch is one of the most abundant polysaccharides worldwide next to cellulose. Starch bio-polymers are sustainable, biodegradable, and abundant, but are often chemically modified to improve the physical or chemical properties. Cold water-soluble starch (CWS) is a starch variant of industrial relevance for applications including paper coatings, but the high viscosity of starch solutions limits the amount of starch that can be incorporated. It was hypothesized that the graft modification of CWS would make it more industrially useful. Starch was modified using both grafting from and grafting to approaches using nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP). NMP is a type of reversible-deactivation radical polymerization which allows greater control over molecular weight distribution and dispersity compared to free radical polymerization. In this work, bio-synthetic copolymers of starch were targeted with high starch contents to preserve the sustainability of the materials. The bio-synthetic polymers could have applications in sustainable paper coating latexes, in green emulsion formulations, or in wastewater treatment.&#xd;
In the grafting from approach, CWS was modified with 4-vinylbenzyl chloride (VBC) and 2-methyl-2-[N-tertbutyl-N-(diethoxy-phosphoryl-2,2-dimethylpropyl)-aminoxy] propionic acid initiator before graft polymerization with methyl methacrylate-co-styrene, methyl acrylate, and acrylic acid. The (co)polymerisations were well controlled showing linear reaction kinetics and relatively low dispersities (&lt;1.5). Decreasing the monomer concentrations decreased the grafted polymer dispersity. By varying the polymerization time or monomer concentration, bio-synthetic polymeric materials with tunable graft polymer content were produced.&#xd;
In the grafting to approach, poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) or poly(2-(diethylaminoethyl) methacrylate) (PDEAEMA) were synthesized via NMP and reacted with VBC modified CWS. Low grafting reaction substitutions and thereby the low grafting densities were observed which were inherently due to the grafting to method used. The final grafted materials had high starch contents. The grafted materials were shown to be pH-responsive by titration, switching from positive zeta-potential at low pH to negative zeta-potential at high pH.  The measured zero zeta-potential intersect at the polymer pKaH corresponded well with literature for PDMAEMA but poorly for PDEAEMA, indicating precipitation of the PDEAEMA grafted CWS. PDMAEMA and PDEAEMA grafted CWS were shown to be good candidates for CO2-switchable bio-materials.</description>

   <description>The objectives of this thesis were: 1) to develop and apply a novel method for objectively measuring the time children and adolescents spend engaged in different types of physical activity, 2) to develop and validate an algorithm that can be used to assess sleep efficiency in children and adolescents using a waist-worn accelerometer, and 3) to determine if using multiple imputation to replace missing accelerometer data influences estimates of sedentary time and associations with health indicators in children and adolescents.&#xd;
Manuscript one describes the development of a methodological approach that can be used to concurrently measure the time that children and adolescents participate in outdoor active play, active travel, curriculum-based physical activity, and organized sport. This measurement approach provides researchers with a new opportunity to measure and study the time that children and adolescents spend in different types of physical activity. &#xd;
In manuscript two, the methodological approach developed in manuscript one was applied to the full sample of children and adolescents from the Active Play Study. This paper provides descriptive estimates of the time that children spend participating in different types of physical activity, the movement intensity composition of these different types of physical activity, and the extent to which these types of physical activity contribute to children’s overall movement. &#xd;
Manuscript three describes the development and cross-validation of a sleep efficiency algorithm for the waist-worn Actical accelerometer. This algorithm will allow researchers to use the same waist-worn accelerometer to measure children and adolescents’ 24-hour movement behaviours.&#xd;
	Manuscript four describes the application of a multiple imputation approach to impute accelerometer epochs that occurred during “non-wear” periods. These results suggest that removing non-wear accelerometer data leads to meaningfully lower estimates of sedentary time and biases the association between sedentary time and cardiometabolic risk towards the null.&#xd;
	Collectively, this thesis research has developed and applied novel measurement and analytical tools to overcome some of the major limitations in assessing the 24-hour movement behaviours of children and adolescents. This opens up many new possibilities for researchers to continue to explore how 24-hour movement behaviours are related to health in children and adolescents.</description>

   <title>Making Home: Performance, Sociability, and Identity in St. John’s, Newfoundland, 1810-1860.</title>

   <description>St. John’s, Newfoundland underwent an economic and cultural transformation in the early nineteenth century. With a growing year-round resident population, and mercantile operations increasingly headquartered out the town, St. John’s began to take on the appearance and infrastructure of a colonial town rather than a temporary summer fishing outpost. “Making Home” explores an emerging middle class’s attempts to change the town itself to reflect their values and ideals, and it charts the performances and expressions of identity that took place on the ground. The thesis examines how, in the years between 1810 and 1860, St. John’s rising middle class created a sense of space and place: how they thought of their local environment, and how they defined it in relation to the wider world. In short, how they made a home and how they saw themselves within that home. It does this by analyzing a selection of the events and sites that compelled people to move through the city: the activities of fraternal and benevolent clubs and societies, the cornerstone-laying and consecration ceremonies of cathedrals, various parades, and the wharfside ceremonies to greet visiting dignitaries. These were the moments during which people performed identities and created imagined communities of club, church, city, and colony, while simultaneously creating literal spaces for those communities by staking claim to city streets.&#xd;
The city’s geographic and economic location (deeply rooted in patterns of Atlantic trade, yet relatively isolated from other major centres by climate and geography) shaped many residents’ ongoing feelings about their home. As a case study of sociability and identity in a colonial setting, “Making Home” explores how both local and Atlantic contexts created a sense of place in a nineteenth-century port town.</description>

   <title>Migration and its Impact on the Household: Medieval Valencia after the Black Death Plague, 1348-1453</title>

   <description>The 1348 Black Death Plague killed at least twenty percent of Valencia’s population, and the effects were devastating: reduced reproduction, raised mortality, massive shifts in migration, intense growth in city population, and an altered structure of the family and the society.  The urban household had to adopt new strategies to deal with the demographic collapse.  Domestic servants, slaves, and foreigners were incorporated into the household to meet needs, and the composition of households changed as internal migration, Mediterranean migration from North Africa and Eastern Europe, and labour migrations all accelerated.  These migrations led to urban reform and to more complex households as many families began to offer lodging and provisions to newcomers.  Christian and Muslim slaves were brought into Valencia as households tried to meet the demographic need for more labour.  Servant numbers also increased, and foreigners migrated to Valencia and began to integrate into the society.  During a century of changes, there was one important constant: the attempt to maintain the centrality and significance of the household within the social organization and the economy.  Masters and mistresses tried to retain responsibility for the everyday management of their households, and they aimed to keep the traditional hierarchical structures of authority in place over their staff, male and female slaves, and non-family members.  However, the increase in the number of complex households in the period brought new relationships between masters, slaves and servants, and more connections were forged with foreigners.  All these changes challenged traditional patriarchal control within households.  Therefore, migration, spurred by the Black Death Plague, had a significant effect on the household structure in late medieval Valencia.  High rates of mortality caused by plague created a lack of domestic labourers and caused economic upheaval; masters needed to incorporate extra-familial members into the household to complete essential household tasks.  The influx of migrant workers and enslaved labourers altered the household’s traditional, kin-based structure and expanded the domestic economy, and these changes challenged the societal order.</description>

   <description>In the following thesis I strive to offer renewed ways of construing “one’s own,” authority, integrity, and intimacy as literary themes, and appropriate form, provisional tonality, and approximate, inexhaustible address as formal aspects of literary works or methodological tools for literary scholars. Part One involves a consideration of contexts for our current understanding of the self, identity/integrity, theology, tradition, and intimacy, which I cast in a fresh light through critical readings of Nietzsche, Freud, Charles Taylor, Amélie Oksenberg Rorty, Thomas Mann, H.-G. Gadamer, Jaroslav Pelikan, Vladimir Lossky, and others. Part Two contains my development of these ideas, in tandem with passages from Bakhtin, as they lead to and are augmented by my own original considerations of prosaic form, tradition, integrity, intimacy. Part Three is devoted to close readings of novels by Virginia Woolf and D.H. Lawrence. I have deliberately chosen to address these two central authors whose work has proved defining in significant ways for modernist literature and its legacy. As I am working to fundamentally reconsider aspects of modernity and our comprehension of it, I focus on the prosaic centre of its English literature, so to speak. Beginning with Woolf’s Mrs Dalloway (1925), I consider how friendship (friendly intimacy) is conditioned by social and individual ethics, the effect of the weight of political (civil) tradition on the individual’s comportment, and how heightened “moments of being” alter a person and translate into grounds for individual character and activity. Second, in Lawrence’s Women in Love (1920), I consider how eros (erotic intimacy) is conditioned and threatened by cultural traditions, how the weight of assumed aesthetic and ontological forms challenge individual freedom, and how certain habitual absolutes by which a person may live can take an abstract, “deathly” form. In both cases, I am interested in how the novelist depicts the struggles between absolutes and temporal forms of authority and specific characters, how this confrontation and struggle is conditioned by the intimate spheres of the characters’ lives, and how this shared, relational intimate sphere becomes the arena for the process of integration, which in turn allows the character (and reader) to make sense of their own self and helps to determine their relationships with other characters in the work.</description>

   <description>This project investigates the 1936 Berlin Olympics theatre production Das Frankenburger Würfelspiel, an example of the National Socialist theatre movement the Thingspiel. The goal is to explore the methods intended by Das Frankenburger Würfelspiel to create a national community. This has been done by examining how the production’s narrative, the participants’ experiences, and the production’s use of site contributed to creating this community. Upon this examination, it becomes clear that the plot of the production presented a revised historical narrative, imbued with ideological content, intended to modify German social memory. Additionally, this research found that the production’s performance style enabled its participants to internalise the production’s messages. The performance style also helped to bond participants into a community. Finally, the production’s use of site allowed participants to solidify their connection to National Socialist ideology and each other. This research has also unveiled similarities between the tactics of the Thingspiel and how United States President Donald Trump courted voters during his electoral campaign and into the present day. Through showing how the Nazi party conceptualised the Thingspiel to create community, this research highlights the cultural machinations of fascism.</description>

   <title>Nation, Race, and the Cultural Political Economy of Art for Social Change Philanthropy in Canada</title>

   <description>The arts are increasingly celebrated as a powerful mechanism for a philanthropic sector seeking to address some of society’s most pressing social and economic challenges. Over the past decade, “art for social change” [AFSC] charities and artists have become key sites of investment for some of the wealthiest philanthropic foundations in Canada and the United States. However, existing scholarship on the AFSC primarily serves as an exercise in mapping the field, or as a source of uncritical AFSC advocacy. In response, this dissertation provides the first critical exploration of the possibilities, tensions, and limits of the institution of AFSC philanthropy, specifically as it pertains to addressing contemporary issues of social injustice in Canada. This dissertation enriches the Marxian-inspired critiques of neoliberalism that dominate the critical literature on philanthropy by situating AFSC philanthropy more specifically within racialized and colonial histories of the Canadian nation-state. Offering a range of cases and combining methodological approaches including ethnographic study, discourse analysis, and analysis of public databases, this dissertation considers the manifold ways in which the intersecting dynamics of nation-building, racism, white settler-colonialism, and capitalist development articulate within AFSC philanthropy. This is accomplished by attending to the material aspects of racism and colonialism as they pertain to the capitalist accumulation strategies that serve as the economic engine of AFSC philanthropy. Equally important, however, are the ways in which discourses of Canadian identity—multiculturalism, diversity, tolerance, and international peacekeeping, for example—shape philanthropic policy, practice, and branding at the level of AFSC funder, community organization, and artist. Specifically, I argue that racist and colonial discourses of the nation and national “goodness” are mobilized by AFSC philanthropic funders, charities, and artists in ways that de-historicize and de-race the political-economic and cultural contradictions underlying AFSC philanthropy. Ultimately, this dissertation makes the case for centering questions of nation and race in studies of the AFSC, as well as in critical examinations of philanthropy more broadly.</description>

   <description>Zirconium alloys are used extensively in the nuclear industry, largely due to the very low neutron capture cross-section of zirconium. Alloying of zirconium with substitutional solutes, like Sn, Mo or Nb, is common to assist in strengthening the material, through either direct solute strengthening, or enhancing control of the microstructure through the introduction of the β phase. One such alloy, Zr-3.2Sn-0.8Mo-0.8Nb, known as Excel, has been the subject of recent study as a possible replacement for the more common Zr-2.5wt%Nb alloy. This dissertation presents a body of research investigating the metastability of the β phase within this alloy, and exploring the decomposition of this phase under mechanical and thermal treatment.&#xd;
This thesis is presented in manuscript format, composed of six manuscript chapters. Chapter 3 presents work investigating the thermal α + β to β phase transformation, establishing the transus temperature and the nature of solute redistribution during cooling from the fully β microstructure. Chapter 4 investigates the nature of retention of a metastable β phase to room temperature, with a focus on understanding the effect of cooling rate and providing a framework for understanding why this process is achievable in this particular alloy system. Chapter 5 provides evidence for a mechanically-induced β to α phase transformation, with a combination of neutron and electron diffraction data, supported by a simple and effective new model that directly relates the experimental data to crystallographic properties of the phase transformation. The next two chapters present studies that further probe the nature of this phase transformation, with a focus on temperature and loading orientation in Chapter 6, and the effect of strain and dislocation dynamics in Chapter 7. Both chapters further develop the model and demonstrate the unique behaviour of the deformation-induced phase transformation. Chapter 8, the final manuscript chapter, presents a study on the thermal decomposition of the metastable β phase. The six manuscript chapters are followed by Chapter 9, which presents a summary of the major conclusions of each work, a discussion on how each chapter is related, and recommendations for future research.</description>

   <description>This doctoral research-creation project focuses on plants in the context of larger efforts by artists and scholars to denaturalize the anthropocentric and hierarchical ordering of species that objectify non-human life. Through the lens of Cultural Studies and artistic practice, this project looks at the relationship between people and plants—the symbiotic partnerships, everyday encounters, imaginings, and hybrid possibilities that exist between human and vegetal worlds. This exploration is rooted in the following questions: Why is looking at plants appropriate in this particular cultural moment? How are forms of artistic production positioned such that they may allow for exploring new ways of imagining human relationships to plant life? And finally, can we get to know plants differently?&#xd;
This doctoral thesis takes a rhizomatic approach. It includes six completed artworks developed since 2014, each exploring distinct entry points into the questions posed above: the immersive installation and major project, A Breathing Room (2017) and Movement Compositions (2017) respectively, a series of cyanotype works on paper referencing early botanical science; Plant Radio for Plants (2014–2016) with Brad Isaacs, which created a means of communication between communities of indoor and outdoor plants; PARKhive (2015–2016) with artists Teresa Carlesimo and Michael DiRisio, a public, socially-engaged project promoting citizen involvement in the expansion of urban green-space; Audible Garden (2014–2015), a project with musician Adam Phipps that used biometric sensing devices and micro-controllers in an attempt to translate the real-time responses of human-plant interactions into sound; and Adopt-A-Plant and the Windsor Workshop Series (2014), a community-based plant adoption project and workshop series developed for the Neighbourhood Spaces Residency program in Windsor, Ontario. &#xd;
The parallel text examines imaginings of plant-being in theoretical, cultural, and artistic contexts, and considers concurrent research in the sciences, juxtaposing and extrapolating potential meanings. The elements of this work combine to ask many questions, presenting these to readers, participants, and viewers along with proposals for new ways of imagining plant being and interacting with more-than-human plant worlds.</description>

   <description>This thesis describes the development of a unique Moving Load Simulator (MLS) for testing bridge superstructure with a footprint up to 4x17 m, and its first application to test a full scale B900 prestressed concrete box girder. The aim of the experiment was to verify that the MLS can apply cyclic loading in a controlled laboratory environment, under realistic highway scale 'rolling wheel loads', determined through code procedures as well as through finite element analysis of a real bridge. The MLS has two half-axles of a large tandem, each comprising a dual air-inflated tires spaced at either 1.2 or 2.4 m. Each half-axle can apply up to 125 kN, representing the heaviest half-axle load of the CL-625 design truck of CHBDC. The maximum travel range and speed are 14.9 m and 6 ms, respectively. A bridge design of eight adjacent B900 girders of 27.6 m span was used as a case study. Load distribution analyses were conducted using both; a finite element model of the full bridge under various CL-625 truck loading configurations and the CHBDC load distribution method, and both agreed well. Load scaling analysis of the girder share was then conducted to account for shortening it to 16 m, resulting in two-115 kN MLS design loads, 1.2 m apart. This verifies that the MLS is indeed capable of applying full scale highway loads in a laboratory environment, which is novel.  Multiple passes were conducted at various loads of 40-100% of design load and at speeds of 1-5 ms to examine the machine and girder behaviours. It was found that load fluctuates by less than 10% of full capacity and a 0.13 sec/cycle time lag occurs. The measured girder deflection and elastic strains were 11-20% lower than predicted theoretically. The estimated time to complete 3M cycles in approximately 4.5 months. With this machine now verified, future tests will involve fatigue tests for months at a time.</description>

   <description>This thesis examines the early evolution of the global prohibitory regime surrounding the production, manufacture, distribution, and consumption of illicit drugs --notably opium, cocaine, and cannabis. The primary focus of my historical analysis is the series of international conferences at which this legal edifice was first conceived during the early twentieth-century, with particular emphasis placed on those meetings held under the auspices of the League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee. Contextualizing these summits at Shanghai (1909), The Hague (1912-1914), and Geneva (1924-1936) as an unforeseen consequence of the Indo-Chinese opium trade, I explore how the treaties which resulted from these multilateral negotiations were overwhelmingly shaped by the competing economic and geopolitical interests of Great Britain, the United States, and China. Building upon the predominant themes of the existing historiography concerning international drug control, I construct my historical narrative from a wide array of archival source material, including conference minutes, national delegation reports, governmental commissions, private correspondence, and contemporary press articles. I argue that contemporary practical realities and diplomatic exigencies worked to formulate a misguided and ineffective global legal framework which premised its entire operation on the enforcement of supply control measures, rather than the treatment of drug addiction itself.</description>

   <description>Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression. Differential expression observed in miRNAs, combined with advancements in deep learning (DL), have the potential to improve cancer classification by modelling non-linear miRNA-phenotype associations. We propose a novel miRNA-based deep cancer classifier (DCC) incorporating genomic and hierarchical tissue annotation, capable of accurately predicting the presence of cancer in wide range of human tissues.&#xd;
Methods: miRNA expression profiles were analyzed for 2530 neoplastic and 5184 non-neoplastic samples, across 38 organ types involving 78 organ sub-structures and 173 cell types. Specificity of miRNA expression was explored in relation to tissue type and neoplasticity, adjusting for sampling bias using three levels of hierarchical annotation. A DL architecture composed of stacked autoencoders (AE) and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) was trained to predict neoplasticity using 845 high-confidence miRNAs. Additional DCCs were trained using expression of miRNA cistrons and sequence families, and combined as a diagnostic ensemble. Predictive importance of miRNAs was measured using backpropagation, and top miRNAs analyzed in Cytoscape using iCTNet and BiNGO.&#xd;
Results: Performance of the DCC was tested on an unseen, randomly selected set of 1511 samples. The model classified cancer with 94.73% accuracy, 98.6% AUC/ROC, 95.1% sensitivity, and 94.3% specificity. A concise assay of the 20 most predictive miRNAs achieved 85.0% accuracy, 93.3% AUC/ROC, 92.3% sensitivity and 74.9% specificity.&#xd;
Conclusion: Deep autoencoder networks are a powerful tool for modelling complex miRNA-phenotype associations in cancer. The proposed DCC improves classification accuracy by learning from the biological context of both samples and miRNAs, using genomic and anatomic annotation. Analyzing the trained DCC also provides estimates of miRNAs importance for cancer prediction, which can be used for feature selection and biological discovery, by performing gene ontology searches on the most highly significant features.</description>

   <title>The Roles of the Neuropeptide Receptor NPR-14 in the Regulation of Sleep Behaviours in Caenorhabditis elegans</title>
   <creator>Barnay, Rawah</creator>
   <subject>Caenorhabditis elegans</subject>
   <subject>sleep</subject>
   <description>Most animals with a nervous system exhibit sleep behaviour(s) during their life cycle, which appears as a decreased level of physical activity and changes in metabolism. Even animals with a simple nervous system like Caenorhabditis elegans have shown sleep behaviour. Two types of sleep have been characterized in C. elegans. The first is a developmentally timed quiescence (DTS), known as lethargus; and the second is a stress induced quiescence (SIS). Each type of sleep functions through different neuronal pathways and utilizes a variety of neuropeptide signaling molecules. The DTS pathway uses the expression of the neuropeptide gene nlp-22 and that of the SIS pathway uses the neuropeptide flp-13. Our lab has discovered a neuropeptide receptor gene called npr-14 that, when mutated, displays quiescence behaviour. We seek to answer the question: How does npr-14 fit in the DTS or SIS sleep pathways? The role of npr-14 in the sleep circuit was tested using experiments that analyze the behaviour of npr-14 (LF) (loss of function) and npr-14(OE)(overexpression) alone and in combination with loss of function alleles of - flp-13, nlp-22, and other known components in the sleep pathway. Results of this research will enhance our understanding of the sleep circuit in C. elegans. Understanding this sleep circuit is important because it may contribute to the understanding of many sleep disorders.</description>

   <description>This dissertation explores the representation of early Anabaptism and Mennonitism in the visual culture of the Dutch Republic (1585-1795). Polemical and satirical imagery critical of Anabaptism circulated alongside artworks presenting Anabaptist theological heritage in a positive light. Book illustrations offer the most frequent site for representation, joined by broadsheets, print series, and a few drawings and paintings. While historians and theologians, working from literary and archival materials, have traced the complex evolution of Dutch Mennonite theology and culture from the sixteenth century through the Enlightenment, this study brings a new, interdisciplinary application of these findings to the analysis of visual representations that interpreted 16th-century Dutch Anabaptism for 17th- and 18th-century viewers. &#xd;
Polemical critiques were the first to represent the group’s early history, establishing iconographical conventions that persisted for centuries. Most widely depicted were early Anabaptist insurrections at Münster and Amsterdam, portraits of Münsterite leaders, and the controversial practice of adult baptism. Illustrations appeared in historical accounts, anti-sectarian treatises, heretic biographies, city descriptions, and religious ethnographies, as well as emblems and allegories. Meanwhile, Mennonites themselves were slower to produce or commission apologetical imagery supporting their long-established efforts to distance themselves from Münsterite violence and promote the pacifist ideals advocated by leaders such as Menno Simons. Martyrology illustrations, beginning with frontispieces and culminating in depictions of specific events engraved by Jan Luyken for the Martyrs Mirror (1685), boldly aligned the suffering and executions of 16th-century Anabaptists with the martyrs of the apostolic age and the early church. &#xd;
The images considered here, many of which have not been examined before, were produced and circulated at a time when Mennonites were becoming increasingly assimilated and engaged in the cultural and economic fabric of Dutch society. Consideration of a range of images in relationship to their literary and socio-historical contexts of display demonstrates the diverse roles played by visual representation in supporting, spreading, and sometimes challenging prevailing attitudes toward Anabaptist-Mennonite tradition in the Dutch Republic. This analysis demonstrates how the opposing visual tropes of the Anabaptist as heretic and as martyr both operated as powerful polemical and apologetical tools in Dutch literature and visual art.</description>

   <title>Study of Kinetics and Mechanism of Pyrite Oxidation in Sulfuric Acid Solution</title>

   <description>There is a significant interest in studying pyrite oxidation in terms of refractory gold ore processing and acid mine drainage (AMD) treatment. However, the mechanism of pyrite oxidation has not been well understood yet. Most of the kinetics studies of pyrite oxidation focus on the corrosion process of pyrite, neglecting the kinetics of Fe3+/Fe2+ redox reaction on the surface of pyrite. In this work, based on the mixed potential theory, the chronoamperometry and cyclic voltammetry methods were used to isolate the Fe3+/Fe2+ reaction from other interfering reactions to study pyrite oxidation kinetics. &#xd;
As part of the kinetics study, the effects of the pyrite origin, the Fe3+ and Fe2+ ions concentrations, and the operating temperature on the Fe3+/Fe2+ reaction on the pyrite surface were investigated. The exchange current densities of the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox reaction in this study had the same magnitude of 10-5 Acm-2 for all the experiments; increasing iron concentration by an order of magnitude or the test temperature from 22 to 65 °C did not have significant effects on the Fe3+/Fe2+ couple redox reaction exchange current density nor on the value of the cathodic transfer coefficients of the reaction. Nevertheless, the anodic transfer coefficients had increased substantially with increasing the total Fe concentration and the test temperature. The activation energy for Fe2+ oxidation and Fe3+ reduction on the pyrite surfaces were calculated to be 102.0 and 32.7 kJ mol-1, respectively. &#xd;
In order to study about the effect of Ag on the pyrite electrodissolution process kinetics, Ag-doped pyrite was fabricated by hydrothermal method. The electrochemical dissolution kinetics of the Ag-doped pyrite were studied in different sulfuric acid electrolytes, with or without the addition of Fe and Cu cations. The experimental results showed a reduced pyrite electrochemical reactivity with increasing the Ag content of the Ag-doped pyrites. However, the anodic dissolution of the Ag-doped pyrite electrode showed a substantial increase in the Cu and Fe-containing sulfuric acid solution.</description>

   <title>Spatial variations of pressure-temperature-timing-deformation conditions of ductile thrusts: Examples from the Himalayan and Variscan orogens</title>

   <description>Orogen-scale thrust-sense shear zones evolve dynamically through time and space as they accommodate crustal shortening during continental collision. When these shear zones activate in different parts of an orogen is central to the understanding of how orogenic systems evolve. These shear zones carry rocks from the deep metamorphic core (hinterland) towards the toe of the orogenic wedge (foreland). Rocks therefore record different pressure (P), temperature (T), timing and deformation conditions as they move through segments of a shear zone. These recorded conditions are used here to track deformation on crustal-scale shear zones in the direction of tectonic transport, from the hinterland towards the foreland, of two orogenic systems, the Himalaya and the Variscan orogen. &#xd;
In the western Nepal Himalaya, a major shear zone, the Main Central thrust (MCT), is exposed multiple times in the transport direction. U-Th/Pb monazite petrochronology, U/Pb zircon geochronology, 40Ar/39Ar muscovite thermochronology, metamorphic P-T analyses, and quartz microstructures are used to complement field mapping and determine the recorded conditions of metamorphism and deformation in the MCT zone. Each of the three studied MCT transects reached peak P-T conditions and cooled through 450-350°C at different times. These data indicate that deformation on the MCT was diachronous in the transport direction and that a single shear zone transect is not representative of the timing and duration of deformation on the MCT. &#xd;
Field mapping, microstructures and both in situ and step-heating 40Ar/39Ar white mica geochronology are used to examine a series of successive thrust-sense shear zones exposed on the island of Sardinia, Italy. These shear zones are located intermediate to the hinterland and foreland of the Variscan orogen and record a common timing of mylonite formation and ductile deformation from 325-318 Ma on all three thrusts. &#xd;
The results from this thesis indicate that P-T, timing and deformation conditions can be used effectively to track ductile deformation of rocks as they move through a shear zone that evolves through different kinematic regimes. The timing and duration of ductile deformation may be diachronous in the transport direction and may not evolve unidirectionally from hinterland to foreland.</description>

   <description>Developers insert logging statements in their source code to trace the runtime behaviors of software systems. Logging statements print runtime log messages, which play a critical role in monitoring system status, diagnosing field failures, and bookkeeping user activities. However, developers typically insert logging statements in an ad hoc manner, which usually results in fragile logging code, i.e., insufficient logging in some code snippets and excessive logging in other code snippets. Insufficient logging can significantly increase the difficulty of diagnosing field failures, while excessive logging can cause performance overhead and hide truly important information. The goal of this thesis is to help developers improve their logging practices and the quality of their logging code. We believe that development knowledge (i.e., source code, code change history, and issue reports) contains valuable information that explains developers' rationale of logging, which can help us understand existing logging practices and provide helpful tooling support for such logging practices. &#xd;
&#xd;
Therefore, this thesis proposes to mine different aspects of development knowledge to understand and support software logging practices. We mine issue reports to understand developers' logging concerns, i.e., the benefits and costs of logging from developers' perspective. Our findings shed lights on future research opportunities for helping developers leverage the benefits of logging while minimizing logging costs. We mine source code to learn how developers distribute logging statements in their source code, and propose an approach to provide automated suggestions about where to log. We find that the semantic topics of a code snippet provide another dimension to explain the likelihood of logging a code snippet. We mine code change history to understand how developers develop and maintain their logging code, and propose an automated approach that can provide developers with log change suggestions when they change their code. We also mine code change history to understand how developers choose log levels for their logging statements, and propose an automated approach that can help developers determine the appropriate log level when they add a new logging statement. This thesis highlights the need for standard logging guidelines and automated tooling support for logging.</description>

   <description>This study of the relationship between the Canadian taxpayer and the income tax regime examines the manner in which the federal income tax, first established by Finance Minister Sir Thomas White of the Robert Borden Conservative government in 1917, evolved into a complex and onerous obligation. Its central narrative is a longer history of the mechanics of tax compliance and its evolution. This evolution altered the ramifications of tax compliance creating particular tensions around the taxation of retained corporate earnings and dividend income. Using newspaper articles, chiefly from The Globe and Mail, and the reported cases available on income tax compliance between 1917 and 1931 and the reported cases on surplus stripping between 1942 and 1972, the mechanics and tensions of the administrative tax relationship will be examined. It is proposed that these tensions and taxpayers’ resulting choices should be considered in a framework that does not overly favour the matrix and rhetoric influenced by John Stuart Mill’s equality of sacrifice principles, but that considers Adam Smith’s tenants of taxation, namely a consideration of the presentation and value of tax neutrality, simplicity and certainty.</description>

   <description>Children play an integral role in the reproduction and maintenance of cultures. Simultaneously, culture groups inform the identify formation and development of children. For this reason, one would think that theories discussing children would take culture into consideration, and theories concerning cultural justice would take children into consideration. This has largely not been the case up to now. As the beginnings of a remedy to this, I will put forward a liberal multicultural theory of children’s rights, arguing that children have a right to culture, and that culture groups have a right to children; these rights need to be balanced, while also taking parents, and their rights, into consideration. My examination will require asking how existing theories of children's rights, and existing theories of multiculturalism, address such a balance. The core of the investigation will consider what legitimate claims cultural groups can make re: children, and what legitimate claims children can make re: cultural groups. I will conclude by taking this largely theoretical discussion into a more practical domain, looking at some implications that arise from this balance of rights in specific cases. These cases will, importantly, include intercultural adoption, education, and male infant circumcision. While other cases can be discussed, my intention is to give a brief overview of the implications that arise from my liberal multicultural theory of children’s rights. My arguments will contribute both to the literature on children’s rights, and to the literature on multiculturalism, bringing the two fields closer together and in discussion with one another.</description>

   <description>Reading expands learning opportunities for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) by improving their communication and functional skills, and, in the long run, improving their quality of life.  Research is needed to gain a better understanding of how individuals with autism experience their reading development from their own perspectives and the perspectives of their parents.  Our knowledge of the experiences of individuals with ASD can be expanded by listening to and reflecting on their voices.  Therefore, this study empowered four young adults with High Functioning Autism (HFA) and their parents to share stories and experiences about these young adults’ reading development from early childhood through adolescence.  A qualitative multiple-case design was used.  Data sources included eight one-on-one semi-structured interviews, researcher’s field notes, and a reflective journal.  Qualitative analysis led to eight emergent cross-case themes: 1) differences and similarities in reading profiles, 2) advantage in expository text, 3) challenges in reading, 4) reading strategies, 5) behaviour support, 6) interest and motivation, 7) supportive parents, and 8) different school experiences. Based on rich, in-depth descriptions, this study sheds light on the diverse and varied experiences of four young adults with HFA in their reading development from early childhood through adolescence. The findings of this study help to fill the gap by adding voices of individuals with HFA and their parents. The findings provide researchers with recommendations on case study design and interviews with individuals with HFA, educators with suggestions for instructional practices, and parents with practical guidance.</description>

   <title>Role of the Cadherin-11/Rac1/Stat3 Axis in Src-Mediated Transformation and in Adipocytic Differentiation</title>

   <description>Stat3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-3) is activated by phosphorylation on tyrosine-705 (Stat3-ptyr705) downstream of cytokines, growth factors, and oncogenes. Our lab has demonstrated that engagement of cadherins, a calcium-dependent family of cell-cell adhesion receptors, can also activate Stat3 via upregulation of the Rac1 and Cdc42 small GTPases and IL6 family cytokines, resulting in increased expression of genes involved in cell division and survival.&#xd;
Oncogenes such as Src have been shown to negatively regulate the epithelial (E)-cadherin through a number of different mechanisms. Results presented in this thesis reveal, for the first time, that activated Src can also negatively affect levels of the mesenchymal cadherin-11 (Cad11), which is associated with metastasis in cancers such as breast and prostate. Indeed, stable expression of different levels of activated Src showed an inverse correlation between Src and Cad11 protein levels. Interestingly, cells expressing the highest Src levels had no Cad11 and low levels of Stat3-ptyr705, and Stat3-ptyr705 levels did not increase in Cad11-knockdown cells in which activated Src was expressed, suggesting that Src requires Cad11 to activate Stat3. Most importantly, we report that Src-expressing cells deficient in Cad11 succumb to apoptosis at high densities, pointing to a significant role of the Cad11/Stat3 axis in tumour cell survival signalling.&#xd;
Stat3 activation at confluence was also shown to be important for adipocytic differentiation. Inhibition of Stat3 at the onset of differentiation dramatically reduced the levels of adipocyte protein 2 (aP2) and lipid accumulation, while inhibition of Stat3 after several days of differentiation had no effect. Inhibition of Rac1, an effector of Cad11, was also shown to reduce aP2 and lipid levels, and activated Rac promoted early expression of aP2. Taken together, our results suggest that the survival signal initiated by cadherin engagement is critical for both differentiation and neoplastic transformation. It is especially critical for the survival of tumour cells, which may be overly dependent upon constitutively activated Stat3. Inhibition of Cad11 in cancer therapy would promote apoptosis of metastatic cells specifically (through Stat3 inactivation), a finding which could have important therapeutic implications.</description>

   <title>3-D Design for Additive Manufacturing Utilizing Topology Optimization</title>

   <description>As the frontier of modern-day engineering challenges pushes forward, the integration of multiple strategies to reduce manufacturing cost and increase component performance has engineers turning to tools such as topology optimization (TO) and additive manufacturing (AM). Recent focus on synthesizing AM and TO has led to efforts aimed at integrating these topics into the conventional design cycle.  This manuscript combines two separate research efforts that address the current roadblocks preventing the proliferation of AM technology:&#xd;
The first topic of 3D Topology Optimization for Cost and Time Minimization in Additive Manufacturing expands upon existing mathematical constructs by providing an algorithm to minimize the cost and time associated with AM parts. The formulation has been constructed in such a manner to accommodate topology optimization problems with high element counts; this includes a filtering scheme requiring minimal computational storage and an iterative finite element solver. In order to determine the optimal contribution of AM factors to minimize build time, a rigorous trade-off analysis is conducted. It was found that build time could be decreased by over half for only small decreases in performance – on the order of 7-18% – when the method was applied to academic test problems. &#xd;
The second topic of Void Region Restriction for Additive Manufacturing via Diffusion Physics Approach addresses the issue of eliminating the emergence of void regions TO results in order to render the designs manufacturable by AM. By developing better, computationally efficient solutions to this problem, the integration of these two advanced technologies can be fully realized. A particle diffusion-void restriction (PDVR) method is presented in this work, capable of encouraging the optimization scheme to generate final designs that are fully accessible. Additionally, this method empowers the user to choose the type of post-processing method to clear support material (e.g. three-axis/five-axis milling operations, number and orientation of part set-ups) and therefore quantify the level of costs associated with the post-processing operation. Applied to test problems physically fabricated by AM, baseline designs that possessed inaccessible regions were made to be almost completely accessible by utilizing PDVR for increases in compliance on the order of 10%.</description>

   <title>Suburban growth in the Toronto CMA, 1996-2016: A Case of Johnny Town-Mouse and Timmy Willie</title>
   <creator>Willms, Christopher R</creator>
   <subject>suburbs</subject>
   <subject>toronto</subject>
   <subject>growth plan</subject>
   <description>This report addressed three questions:&#xd;
&#xd;
1.	What proportion of Toronto residents live in suburbs, and what is their distribution?&#xd;
2.	How has this proportion and distribution changed over time?&#xd;
3.	Are local growth management policies achieving their targets and objectives in Toronto?&#xd;
&#xd;
To help answer these questions, proven methods to describe population distribution were employed using data from the Statistics Canada Census for 2016, 2006 and 1996. The results classified all 1,151 census tracts in the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) as either active core, transit suburb, auto suburb, or exurb.&#xd;
&#xd;
Active cores and transit suburbs were generally considered to be locations of more sustainable development. In these locations, higher proportions of commuters walked, cycled, or used some form of transit. Auto suburbs and exurbs were generally considered to be locations of less sustainable development. In these locations, higher proportions of commuters drove personal vehicles and population densities were lower.&#xd;
&#xd;
Policies from the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe emphasize intensification and compact development. Despite a slowed growth rate, auto suburbs account for the same proportion of CMA population in 2016 as they did in 1996. Their large volume makes for slow work to decrease their proportion. For every success where an auto suburb in 1996 became an active core (Newmarket Centre) or transit suburb (Etobicoke Centre or Scarborough Centre) for 2016, scores of other examples exist where greenfield lands in exurban areas were developed and became auto suburbs – from Milton, Oakville, and Brampton to Vaughan, Markham, and other municipalities. &#xd;
&#xd;
Growth in transit suburbs was primarily experienced along major transit corridors in the inner suburbs of the City of Toronto while growth in active cores was primarily expressed as an expansion of the CMA core area. The stark lack of active cores, and even transit suburbs, outside the City of Toronto demonstrates an ineffectiveness of plan policies promoting suburban transit-oriented development to date. Perhaps a review of census data in 2021 will reveal improved results.</description>

   <description>Optically pumped vapour magnetometers have an orientation dependency in measuring the scalar component of the ambient magnetic field which leads to challenges for integration with mobile platforms. Quantifying the 3-D attitude variations (yaw, pitch and roll) of an optically pumped vapour magnetometer, while in-flight and suspended underneath a rotary unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), aids in the successful development of reliable, high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle magnetometry surveys. This study investigates the in-flight 3-D attitude characteristics of a GEM Systems Inc. GSMP-35U potassium vapour magnetometer suspended 3m underneath a Dà-Jiāng Innovations (DJI) S900 multi-rotor UAV. A series of UAV-borne attitude surveys quantified the 3-D attitude variations that a simulated magnetometer payload experienced while freely (or semi-rigidly) suspended underneath the UAV in fair weather. Analysis of the compiled yaw, pitch and roll data resulted in the design of a specialized semi-rigid magnetometer mount, implemented to limit magnetometer rotation about the yaw axis. A subsequent UAV-borne magnetic survey applying this specialized mount resulted in more than 99% of gathered GSMP-35U magnetic data being within industry standards. Overall, this study validates that maintaining magnetometer attitude variations within quantified limits (± 5 degrees yaw, ± 10 degrees pitch and roll) during flight can yield reliable, continuous, and high-resolution UAV-borne magnetic measurements.</description>

   <description>Inclusive education is the best form of education for all children including those with disabilities, however, children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) are often educated in segregated settings or institutionalized in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs). Inclusion research in Ghana has rarely focused on children with IDD, and those that have were limited to examining teacher attitudes and beliefs. Therefore, the overall purpose of this dissertation was to examine the experiences of implementation of inclusive education from the perspectives of children with IDD and their teachers in Accra, Ghana. I conducted three studies as part of this dissertation; a) a scoping review that explored the scope of current literature on inclusive education implementation with children with IDD in African countries, b) a qualitative descriptive study that explored the experiences of children with IDD in inclusive schools in Accra, Ghana and c) a qualitative descriptive study that explored the experiences of teachers of children with IDD in inclusive schools in Accra, Ghana. I gathered data from 16 children and 18 teachers through in-depth interviews. I supplemented children interviews with drawing and observation. I analyzed the data using Braun and Clarke’s (2006) thematic analysis approach. I employed Bronfenbrenner’s bioecological framework and the social model of disability as theoretical perspectives to examine and interpret emerging findings. The results indicate that although children with IDD benefit from opportunities in inclusion, they experience many challenges. The results also suggest an overall stressful classroom environment that makes it challenging for teachers to respond to the additional needs of children with IDD. Findings demonstrate the critical need for improvement of inclusion best practices with children with IDD. The ongoing challenges experienced by children with IDD and their teachers in inclusion suggest that the success of inclusive practices in Ghana is dependent on strong commitments of all stakeholders and a model of specific and appropriate strategies that supports the inclusion of children with IDD.</description>

   <description>My doctoral dissertation, “Unfinished Business: The New Wave of Women’s Horror Cinema,” responds to early considerations in feminist horror studies via the recent surge of horror films directed by women filmmakers for a primarily female audience. Placing this new wave of horror cinema in dialogue with the canonical works of Linda Williams, Carol Clover, and Barbara Creed, I re-evaluate the assumption that horror forecloses the possibility of female spectatorship in favour of male audiences. I argue that a change in authorship from almost exclusively male directors to women artists produces a markedly different form of address previously underrepresented in American and Canadian horror cinemas.&#xd;
&#xd;
Now, for the first time in the genre’s history, women directors are developing a globally substantial body of work that explicitly centres the ‘feminine’ and uses the conventions of horror to bridge topics such as sexuality, menstruation, virginity, gender-based violence, trauma/PTSD, eating disorders, pregnancy, and motherhood all from a woman’s perspective and for a female audience. The result is a cinema that affirms women’s experiences of fear, paranoia, anxiety, and desire, and addresses the ways in which living within patriarchy constitutes its own horror. Given this unprecedented development, the primary aim of this dissertation is to document the ways in which this new body of women-authored/women-driven horror re-inscribes the genre’s primary mode of address as distinctly female/feminine and constructs a tenable subject position for the female spectator. I stake a claim in recording this phenomenon as a crucial cultural moment in the genre’s development and suggest more work needs to be done to account for this cinema’s representational and political offerings.</description>

   <description>This thesis investigates the late accretion hypothesis as an explanation for the unusual gas-richness of the HIghMass sample, a collection of 34 galaxies from the recently completed Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA survey. Accretion is vital to galaxy evolution models as it explains several galaxy properties, including but not limited to the relatively constant metallicity distribution in disk galaxies as well as their extended star formation histories. As such, we search for the indirect signatures of accretion of extraplanar gas in H-alpha velocity fields of three HIghMass galaxies (UGC 7899, UGC 8475, and UGC 9037), obtained with the SITELLE Imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Only the data for UGC 7899 and UGC 9037 are amenable to a direct search of non-circular flows in their inner disk using the DiskFit algorithm. We applied rotation-only, bisymmetric, and radial flow models separately to UGC 7899 and UGC 9037, and a rotation-only model to UGC 8475. Using the kinematic data, and comparison with DiskFit runs on photometric images of each galaxy, we conclude that a bar-like model best describes the kinematics of UGC 7899, and that UGC 9037 exhibits radial flows in its inner disk. A radial flow model for UGC 9037 is consisted with previous results obtained at lower resolution from H I maps. Though this work further constrained the non-circular flows in the inner disk of two HIghMass galaxies, we find no direct evidence to support the late accretion hypothesis for the origin of their unusual gas-richness.</description>

   <title>Comparison of Faculty Versus Structured Peer Feedback: Implications of Technical Skills Training</title>

   <description>The surgical training environment has been required to adapt to multiple changes in recent years. Two challenges have placed significant burdens on traditional training methodology: the emerging need for critically reflective clinicians, and restrictions in the traditional methods of technical skills training. Implementing training for these disparate elements is challenging. Simulation-based training has been widely used to teach both technical and non-technical skills to medical students and residents, however consistent access to faculty feedback during training and implementation of critically reflective activities remains problematic. Self-regulated learning can be used to both provide the mechanism by which skill acquisition and critical reflection can occur. This research consisted of two complimentary studies examining technical skill acquisition and self-regulated learning in medical students using structured peer-feedback to learn technical skills. &#xd;
The technical skills study consisted of two prospective randomized controlled trials comparing structured peer-feedback versus traditional faculty feedback for the acquisition of a technical skill. Participants in the peer-feedback group provided feedback to each other using a structural process taught through pre-training with an assessment tool. Participants completed five attempts at the skill over four days. Performance in the peer-feedback group was found to be non-inferior to the faculty group across all assessment criteria used in the study: blinded expert assessment, time to completion and functional test. &#xd;
The impact on self-regulated learning was examined using thematic analysis of student responses to multiple surveys and the written feedback provided by the peer-feedback group. Students developed increasingly sophisticated assessment and feedback skills through regular small exposures to the assessment task. Evidence of self-regulated learning was demonstrated by students’ improvement in technical performance, evaluative judgement of their peer’s performance, self-identification of the benefit of these assessment skills to their own learning, and subsequent implementation of these skills in other contexts. Despite improved assessment skills students did not believe the feedback they provided was beneficial – likely due to a lack of external feedback on their assessment skills from faculty.&#xd;
This research has demonstrated that with appropriate support, structured peer-feedback can be used to augment traditional faculty led training, whilst additionally developing students’ evaluative judgement and self-regulated learning.</description>

   <title>Fatigue-Independent Alterations in Muscle Activation and Effort Perception During Forearm Exercise: The Role of Local Oxygen Delivery</title>

   <subject>Voluntary Exercise</subject>
   <description>In exercise, the sensations of effort to make the muscles do exercise can contribute to an individual’s decision to stop exercise or decrease exercise intensity. Skeletal muscle fatigue is one mechanism by which the effort required to continue exercise can be increased. In order to continue exercise with fatigued skeletal muscle we must increase the amount of electrical signals sent to the muscle. This increase in electrical signals sent to the muscle is perceived by the exercising individual and is interpreted as increased perception of effort to maintain the same exercise intensity. Another mechanism which may also require increased electrical activity sent to the muscle and therefore may increase perception of effort for the same exercise intensity is exercise where oxygen delivery is suboptimal, resulting in reduced oxygen levels (oxygenation) in the muscle. When human and animal muscle is electrically stimulated, force produced for a given electrical stimulation decreases when muscle oxygenation is reduced. When muscle oxygenation is restored force produced is also rapidly restored for the same electrical stimulation. This rapid adjustment of force for the same electrical stimulation with changes in muscle oxygenation is referred to as the oxygen conforming response (OCR). However, the existence of an OCR in voluntary human exercise has not been established and it remains to be determined if our perceptions of effort will follow changes in electrical signal sent to the muscle as a result of the OCR. We tested these unanswered questions by intermittently reducing forearm blood flow (FBF) during human (n = 16) handgrip exercise. When FBF was reduced, electrical activity and perception of effort increased. Interestingly, upon the first restoration of FBF neither electrical activity nor perception of effort were restored. We interpreted these findings to be consistent with skeletal muscle fatigue development during the first compromise to muscle oxygenation. Upon the second restoration of FBF both electrical activity and perception of effort were restored, which is consistent with an OCR and its ability to rapidly modify perception of effort in voluntary human exercise. Through its effects on effort perception, the OCR may therefore have important implications for exercise behaviour.</description>

   <description>The fecal contamination of drinking water causing acute gastrointestinal illness remains a threat to public health in Canada, including Ontario, particularly in rural regions reliant on private well water. To determine potability, water is assessed for the presence of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) to indicate contamination with harmful fecal pathogens. Escherichia coli remains the most frequently employed FIB, given it is a natural inhabitant of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of warm-blooded animals. However, the use of E. coli as a FIB has been questioned in recent years with the identification of populations of environmentally-adapted E. coli capable of survival and growth outside of the GIT, including in water and soil. Environmentally-adapted E. coli do not represent a recent fecal contamination event and thus challenge the current dogma that the presence of E. coli in water always reflects recent contamination from a fecal source and the potential presence of fecal pathogens.&#xd;
&#xd;
This study hypothesizes that environmentally-adapted E. coli populations are present in private well water in southeastern Ontario. Environmentally-adapted populations were characterized by comparing the genetic signature and phylogenetic origin of E. coli isolates obtained directly from feces of a variety of hosts to that obtained from domestic private well water samples, both collected from southeastern Ontario. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and accessory gene fingerprinting were employed to facilitate identifying genetic fingerprints unique to well water and, in combination with phylogroup analysis, this revealed the presence of environmentally-adapted E. coli populations in 66% of the 76 E. coli positive wells analyzed. All isolates sampled from 37% of E. coli positive wells were exclusively of environmentally-adapted populations. These findings show that environmentally-adapted E. coli are widespread in domestic private well water in southeastern Ontario. This is the first study to investigate and report the presence of environmentally-adapted E. coli in private well water. As a result, the reassessment of E. coli as the principle FIB is required, as well as a review of current water quality testing methodology and interpretation. These findings may inform future drinking water quality guidelines, policy, and public health risk assessment.</description>

   <description>Adolescents have become an important target for contact based anti-stigma programs. Research on mental health stigma reduction in adolescents has been hindered by lack of validated measures to evaluate interventions. To reduce stigma and improve mental health, we need the capacity to observe and measure stigma and to evaluate whether or not interventions are producing the desired effect. The many scales used to measure attitudes towards people with mental illness that exist today are not adequate as they have been developed for the adult population outside of the intervention setting.&#xd;
&#xd;
The first objective was to develop two scales, one to measure stereotypic attributions toward people with a mental illness and another to measure social acceptance of those with a mental illness. The second objective was to use the scales to evaluate three different types of contact-based interventions that were delivered by one program.&#xd;
&#xd;
Survey data were collected from adolescent students aged between 12 and 19 years Qualitative methods, including expert opinion and focus group discussion were used for item generation, item review and refinement, and in general to establish content validity. Quantitative methods, such as exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, known group differences, Cronbach’s alpha and test-retest reliability were also used to assess validity and reliability. For the second objective students received one of three contact-based interventions or a comparison situation. Data were analyzed using linear regression.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results showed that a one-factor solution was the best fit for the data for each scale.  When programs were evaluated, larger improvements were seen on the Stereotypic Attributions scale than on the Social Acceptance scale. For the second objective all three interventions types showed a positive change in social acceptance compared to a group that did not receive an intervention.&#xd;
&#xd;
This study has established initial reliability and validity of two scales to evaluate youth attitudes towards and social acceptance of those with a mental illness in a wide range of samples of students from middle and high schools in Canada.  This study has also demonstrated that contact-based education provided in class, as an assembly, or as a student summit can be promising practices for reducing stigma in middle and high school students.</description>

   <description>Binocular fusion is our ability to combine the two separate retinal images into a single fused image, even if the images are separated by a certain amount of disparity. We hypothesized that lower spatial frequencies sampled over a large field of view (FOV) contribute to extending the fusional vergence range (FVR), which is the extent to which binocular single vision (BSV) can be held together with increasing image disparities. Testing these properties allows for the illustration of the contribution of the monocular periphery to binocular fusion. Two separate experiments were run to test this hypothesis; one which varied the spatial frequency of stimuli and one which varied the FOV. Both experiments involved the use of a head-mounted display (HMD) to haploscopically present stimuli to participants. The procedure involved participants manually moving the stimuli apart from each other until they perceptually separated and then back together until they fused, with the resulting disparity at these points being used to calculate the FVR, along with the hysteresis and any potential heterophoria present. The first experiment found the opposite effect of spatial frequency than what was reported in the literature, with lower spatial frequencies resulting in a lower FVR. The second experiment did not find any effect of FOV. These differences compared to the literature could be the result of using an HMD methodology, or the use of complex images as stimuli (which was found to result in a larger FVR than the literature). In future research, the use of different methodologies with complex images would provide a useful comparison to the current results obtained with an HMD, as well as a test of the interactions between spatial frequency and FOV.</description>

   <description>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a significant concern in chronic kidney disease (CKD) accounting for over half of all mortality. The high CVD prevalence in CKD is not accounted for by traditional Framingham risk factors (e.g. smoking, obesity) and is likely influenced by CKD-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD). CKD-MBD consists of abnormalities in circulating calcium, phosphate, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone (PTH), as well the development of soft tissue calcifications like vascular calcification (VC). CKD-MBD has been well-characterized clinically and experimentally, however, significant knowledge gaps exist pertaining to: treatment targets and modalities, daily variation in minerals/hormones, the impact of the circulating factors versus local factors on VC, and inversely the impact of VC on the circulating mineral/hormonal milieu.&#xd;
A dietary adenine model was used to induce CKD in rats with differing phosphate diets to propagate/mitigate CKD-MBD. In comparison to healthy rats those with CKD displayed a shift for the acute accrual of infused phosphate and calcium into vascular beds instead of the kidneys and bone. VC amplified this preferential vascular accrual. Further, a preceding phosphate pulse amplifies vascular calcium accrual.&#xd;
In experimental CKD rats CKD treated with calcitriol, alteration of neither the bolus dose nor daily dose administered resulted in improvements to any CKD-MBD parameters. Additionally, adhering to guideline-recommended PTH suppression targets did not provide any benefits in CKD-MBD, other than reducing circulating PTH.&#xd;
In CKD rats fed different phosphate diets, it was found that low phosphate mitigated the pathologic increases in circulating minerals/hormones and protects against VC. Fibroblast growth factor-23 was identified as a potential biomarker for VC in CKD as it was significantly elevated in CKD rats with VC, and early elevations during CKD-induction predicted eventual VC.&#xd;
The daily variations in circulating minerals/hormones was characterized in experimental CKD. It was found that kidney dysfunction did not independently impact circulating minerals/hormones, but that VC significantly impacted the daily variation in circulating phosphate.&#xd;
These findings identify critical areas that need further investigation pertaining to CKD-MBD treatment, as well as expand current knowledge of how the circulating CKD milieu impacts the development of VC and in turn how VC impacts the circulating milieu.</description>

   <description>Gastrointestinal bleeding from angiodysplasia can be a debilitating problem for patients with defective or deficient von Willebrand factor (VWF). Studies have pointed to a regulatory role for VWF in vessel formation however, the mechanisms are not completely understood. We used endothelial cell models and VWF-deficient mice to explore how VWF and in particular VWF multimers regulate angiogenesis. Our main findings are that blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOECs) from patients with inherited and acquired VWF abnormalities display aberrant angiogenesis, circulating VWF multimers negatively regulate cell proliferation, both intracellular and extracellular VWF are likely needed to modulate angiogenesis, and VWF-deficient mice have increased vessel formation.&#xd;
&#xd;
We found abnormal angiogenesis in BOECs from patients with von Willebrand disease (VWD) and aortic stenosis (AS). VWD BOECs had abnormal storage and secretion of VWF associated with increased secretion of the pro-angiogenic molecule angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), impaired cell migration, and increased proliferation of some patient cells. AS patients presented with VWF plasma defects including a loss of high molecular weight multimers (HMWM) prior to surgery relative to after, suggesting increased proteolysis pre-operatively in a shear-dependent manner. Correspondingly, BOECs isolated from AS patients before surgery were more proliferative than controls and had increased intracellular Ang-2.&#xd;
&#xd;
A role for VWF HMWM in modulating cell proliferation is supported by the increased proliferation of BOECs from type 2A VWD and AS patients. Additionally, VWF-deficient cells cultured in the absence of circulating multimers were more proliferative than cells cultured in the presence of even 50% VWF multimers. However, regardless of the circulating VWF multimer content, in the absence of intracellular VWF, cell migration velocity and tubule formation remained unchanged. These observations indicate that both intracellular and extracellular VWF may be required to comprehensively influence angiogenesis.&#xd;
&#xd;
Lastly, we confirmed that VWF has a negative regulatory role in angiogenesis in a mouse model. This was evidenced by the fact that Matrigel plugs from VWF-deficient mice and the ears of one-month old VWF-deficient mice were more vascularized than wild-type.&#xd;
&#xd;
Collectively, these studies point to a multifaceted role for VWF in angiogenesis and expand our existing knowledge on the mechanisms by which VWF regulates vessel formation.</description>

   <description>Purpose: The purpose of this study was to differentiate diagnostic pathways in colorectal cancer in Ontario through the development of a pathway categorization scheme, and evaluate the patient-, disease-, system-related characteristics of patients and the length of the diagnostic interval across the diagnostic pathway categories.&#xd;
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study using an existing cohort at ICES. The study population included patients who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer in Ontario between 2009 and 2012. Cluster analysis used eleven variables that were related to patient presentation, patient visit pattern, patient symptom pattern and referral process to characterize and categorize diagnostic pathways. Chi-square test and One-way ANOVA were used to assess the association between the examined factors (age, sex, material deprivation quintile, comorbidities, and stage) and the diagnostic pathway categorization scheme. Unadjusted quantile regression was used to assess the association between the diagnostic interval length and the diagnostic pathway categorization scheme.&#xd;
Results: Six distinct diagnostic pathways were identified: asymptomatic pathway (N=4,494), colonoscopy pathway (N=10,066), the imaging and colonoscopy pathway (N=3,427), imaging alone pathway (N=2,238), the imaging and emergency presentation pathway (N=2,849) and no pre-diagnostic workup pathway (N=887). Patients who went through a pathway that was more adherent to diagnostic pathway guidelines (eg. asymptomatic pathway) were more likely to be younger, healthier and living in less deprived areas, and they tended to be diagnosed at an early stage with a short diagnostic interval. Patients who were female, older, living in more deprived areas and with more comorbid disease were more likely to go through pathways that were divergent from those guidelines. The length of the diagnostic interval was correlated to the&#xd;
number of colorectal cancer diagnosis-related visits occurring during the interval. All examined factors and the diagnostic interval were significantly associated with the pathway categorization (p&lt;0.0001).&#xd;
Conclusions: This study demonstrated substantial variations in colorectal cancer diagnostic pathways in Ontario. Interventions should be designed to provide individualized and more effective diagnostic services to patients.</description>

   <description>We use molecular modeling to study the non-equilibrium behaviour of polymeric fluids. Specifically, we explore the macromolecular orientation induced by shear flow fields. We choose the simplest molecular model, the rigid dumbbell model, which describes the molecular structure of the polymer with two identical spherical beads joined by a massless fixed rod. For rigid dumbbells suspended in a Newtonian solvent, the viscoelastic response depends exclusively on the dynamics of dumbbell orientation. The orientation distribution function ψ (θ,φ,t) represents the probability of finding dumbbells within the range (θ,θ+dθ) and (φ,φ+dφ). This function is expressed in terms of a partial differential equation called the diffusion equation, which, for any simple shear flow, is solved by postulating a series expansion in the shear rate magnitude. Each order of this expansion yields a new partial differential equation, for which one must postulate a form for its solution. This work finds a simple and direct pattern to these solutions. The use of this pattern reduces the amount of work required to determine the coefficients of the power series expansion of the orientation distribution function,ψi. To demonstrate the usefulness of this new pattern, we arrive at new expressions for these coefficients up to and including the sixth power of the shear rate magnitude. This work also completes previous findings that ended at the fourth power of the shear rate magnitude. We then use the general results found for any simple shear flow to derive the solution for the special case of large-amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS). We extend the orientation distribution function to the 6th power of the shear rate amplitude. We arrive at the Fourier solution for each harmonic contribution to the total orientation distribution function, separating each harmonic into its coefficients in and out-of-phase with cosnωt, ψ'n and ψ" n, respectively. We plot, for the first time, the evolving normalized alternant macromolecular orientation, in the nonlinear viscoelastic regime. Moreover, to deepen our understanding of the macromolecular motions, we distinguish and study two types of possible rotations, tumbling and wobbling</description>

   <description>Background: Concussive and subconcussive head impacts play important roles in long-term brain health. Professional and collegiate football leagues have been taking steps to reduce dangerous and injurious hits during games, and a select few leagues have eliminated contact practices to improve player safety. It has been hypothesized that training camp presents a unique set of circumstances for players, in which they are competing at a high level of intensity and are vying for a spot on their team, and are participating in more than one practice per day. However, there has been no research conducted to date that has measured head impacts sustained in training camp. To this end, we explored the relative exposure of helmet impacts during football games, practices, and training camp, and how impact tally and magnitude differ between session types. We also explored the relative exposure of helmet impacts and magnitudes between position types. &#xd;
Methods: Helmet mounted accelerometers were used to record impacts sustained by collegiate football players through training camp, practices and games for one season. Linear acceleration, rotational velocity, and impact location were recorded for every impact. Impacts were analyzed to determine differences in impact tallies and impact magnitudes for different session types and position types. Players were classified as inside or outside of the box. Players that line up in close proximity to the ball, roughly within 3-5 yards of the line of scrimmage, are considered to be inside the box. Players that begin each play at a distance from the ball or further than five yards from the line of scrimmage are considered to be outside of the box.&#xd;
Results and Discussion: Impacts occurred at the highest frequency and linear acceleration in games, followed by training camp, then practices. Impacts occurred at the highest rotational velocity in games, followed by practices, with no difference between practices and training camp. Players inside of the box sustained impacts at a higher frequency and magnitude than players outside of the box. Based on our findings, training camp may pose a greater risk to player safety than practices, especially for players inside of the box.</description>

   <description>Cultural eutrophication, the addition of excess nutrients to an aquatic system, is a significant water quality concern that often promotes excess algal growth and deep-water oxygen depletion. Deep-water oxygen also influences internal nutrient loading and is an important parameter used to assess cold-water fish habitat, though long-term data are often unavailable. Chironomid (Diptera: Chironomidae) assemblages have been shown to change with deep-water oxygen concentrations and can therefore be used to reconstruct these missing data sets. This thesis used paleolimnological techniques to analyze inferred whole-lake primary production, sedimentary chironomid assemblages, and inferred volume-weighted hypolimnetic oxygen to determine how cold-water fish habitat has changed through time. I will also examine whether biological recovery after nutrient-targeting remediation was introduced was evident in sedimentary chironomid assemblages. I focused on two lakes with increasing inferred whole-lake primary production (Muskrat and Stoco lakes, Ontario) and one lake with decreasing inferred primary production (Lac Duhamel, near Mont Tremblant, Québec) over time. The majority of change in response to elevated inferred whole-lake primary production is evident in littoral taxa and head capsule concentrations, though oxy-conforming profundal taxa (e.g. Micropsectra) did respond to increased whole-lake primary production. Overall, deep-water oxygen recovery after nutrient-targeting remediation was not evident in the sedimentary chironomid assemblages and that there were generally only subtle responses to elevated whole-lake primary production. Many of our lakes had historically low deep-water oxygen concentrations that were suboptimal for cold-water fish throughout their sedimentary records, with two lakes experiencing modest declines after there were increases in whole-lake primary production. These paleolimnological data can be used to set realistic mitigation targets for deep-water oxygen conditions and cold-water fish habitat restoration.</description>

   <description>Osteoporosis is a degenerative bone disease that causes an increase of fracture risk. The present method of diagnosing the disease is through a bone mineral density (BMD) scan which neglects bone quality. Due to the complexity of bone, experimental testing is difficult; hence the use of finite element models can assist in understanding deformation behaviour and failure mechanisms. The aim of this study is to construct specimen specific-finite element models to investigate stiffness sharing and axial strain distributions of cortical versus trabecular bone of rat L4 vertebral bodies with and without the inclusion of vascular apertures. &#xd;
In a previous experimental study, healthy (SHAM), osteoporotic (OVX) and treated osteoporotic (OVX+E) rat vertebrae underwent uniaxial compression while synchronously imaged with a micro-CT machine [1]. For the present study, these images have been processed into 3D FE models.  The ratio of cortical shell stiffness to total vertebral body apparent stiffness was 70.1 ± 4.5% across all models with no significant difference across health conditions. However, since this value is significantly (P&lt;0.01) higher than previously reported values in humans, caution should be taken when extrapolating rat vertebrae behaviour to those of humans.  When viewing the axial strain, it was found that in the OVX models, the trabeculae had statistically significantly lower mean strains but a larger proportion of high strain elements creating more strain heterogeneity. Another confounding issue in these rat vertebrae is the presence of large vascular apertures in the dorsal surface of the cortical shell, that have been shown to be associated with cracks [2]. Additional models were created that removed these holes by virtually filling them in. The apparent stiffness of the cortical shell was found to increase by only 0.5%. Looking at the average axial strain distributions with the removal of the vascular apertures, the trabeculae strains showed minimal change, but the cortical shell experienced a significant (P&lt;0.01) increased average axial strain across all health conditions. These results suggest that failure likely originates in the cortical shell and is affected by the presence of the vascular apertures, before progressing into the reduced trabecular network in the region adjacent to the vascular apertures.</description>

   <description>To improve patient safety, many surgical and interventional specialties use simulation training. This ensures that trainees have a minimum level of proficiency prior to real patient encounters. During simulation training, it is imperative to assess trainees’ learning curves and instruct trainees how to improve their skills. It is infeasible, however, for expert preceptors to continually monitor trainees during training. As a supplement to expert supervision, computer-assisted training has emerged. This thesis proposes computer-assisted methods for assessment, feedback, and instruction in image-guided interventions training. This thesis makes the following contributions.&#xd;
1. A comprehensive and methodical review of the literature in computer-assisted assessment methods for image-guided interventions training. The review outlines characteristics by which assessment methods can be classified and identifies tools available to the community.&#xd;
2. Studies on the development and validation of performance metrics for skills assessment in image-guided interventions. The analysis of hand and arm movements in simulated colonoscopy distinguished between novice and experts. The quantification of the planning process in deep brain stimulation indicated skill and was useful for monitoring learning curves during a training course. In both cases, application-specific metrics formulated in consultation with clinical experts had added value in assessment.&#xd;
3. Methods for overall skills assessment in ultrasound-guided interventions based on performance metrics. A framework for determining which aspects of an intervention are assessed by which performance metrics was designed and validated in three applications. A method for overall skills assessment using transparent and configurable machine learning was developed. It was shown to both be accurate and provide useful feedback to trainees automatically.&#xd;
4. Development of a method for automated workflow analysis in ultrasound-guided needle interventions. The method combines domain-knowledge with pattern recognition techniques to provide instruction in real-time. The method achieves accuracy approaching the accuracy attained by human observers.&#xd;
Automated assessment, feedback, and instruction is feasible for computer-assisted training in image-guided interventions when an expert preceptor cannot be present. In this context, the proposed methods have been developed and validated in real training scenarios. The methods are made available to the community through Perk Tutor (www.perktutor.org), an open-source image-guided interventions training platform.</description>

   <description>The performance of a corrugated, high-density polyethylene stormwater retention arch subjected to deep burial conditions was investigated. Current design methods are based on evaluation of performance under both shallow and deep burial conditions. Although field testing and two-dimensional finite element analyses have been carried out during the development of these arched chambers, there has been an absence of high quality laboratory testing and three-dimensional finite element investigation of the failure mechanism and the ultimate limit state under deep burial conditions. This thesis first presents results from a full-scale experiment of two buried, corrugated, high-density polyethylene arches with a 350 mm rise, 690 mm span, and 150 mm spacing surrounded by uncompacted gravel backfill under simulated deep burial conditions. Both performance during backfill and under simulated deep burial conditions up to an applied pressure of 280 kPa were evaluated. Research quantified the structural performance by the evaluation of limit states, examination of global stability, detection of onset and progression of local buckling, and inferred soil behaviour of surrounding backfill. Performance was dominated by large vertical deflections and through-thickness thrusts, with local buckling beginning under an applied pressure of 220 kPa. Second, a three-dimensional finite element analysis was conducted and validated against the physical measurements. Material nonlinearity of the structure material was represented by an updated viscoplastic formulation to account for lower strain rates, while the surrounding backfill material was represented by a linear-elastic, plastic formulation with a Mohr-Coulomb failure criteria and non-associated plastic flow. The model took geometrical nonlinearity into account as the corrugation geometry responded to the applied pressure. Time-dependent behaviour was noted under constant load holds, particularly during the increments once the ultimate limit state had been reached. The explicit three-dimensional finite element model of the buried arches was able to successfully simulate behaviour measured in the physical experiment. A parametric study was then performed to capitalize on the calibrated analysis and extend this work by performing a series of parametric studies which considered factors including soil and structure material parameters, interface constraints, development of local buckling, backfilling effects, and spacing of parallel arches.</description>

   <title>Calculating Strain and Stress in Geomembranes at Gravel Indentations</title>

   <description>New methods were developed, validated and applied to calculate strain and stress in geomembrane liners from the local deformed shape imposed by overlying coarse gravel under vertical pressure. Previous strain calculation methods consider only vertical displacements of the geomembrane or neglect bending effects and, consequently, underestimate the maximum strain.  Here, the geomembrane was assumed to behave as a thin plate that undergoes vertical and lateral displacements during deformation. The vertical displacement is the only measurement required while horizontal displacements are related to the deformed shape by strain compatibility equations and obtained by solution to Airy’s stress function. &#xd;
A viscoplastic model was developed and verified against data from physical experiments to get new insight of stress and strain developed in the wide-strip tensile test, verify the new strain calculation method, and to convert the calculated strain to stress. An axisymmetric single gravel indentation was created by pushing a machined probe into a geomembrane disc clamped around its perimeter. The new strain calculation method yielded strain in very good agreement (within 4% of the maximum strain) with the numerical simulation of the single gravel indentation test. &#xd;
 The calculated strains were converted to stress using a direct stress-relaxation method. The method utilizes the fading memory concept where the deformation path is taken to have a minor effect on stress if strains remain constant for some time before calculating stress at the time of interest. The method was verified against, and found to be in good agreement with, stresses from finite element models of gravel indentation problems.  &#xd;
The new strain and stress methods were applied to analyse the deformed shape of a geomembrane from a physical test with coarse gravel above and compressible clay beneath the geomembrane to examine the new insights gained from protection layer testing. Comparison with previous strain calculation methods showed that past simplifying assumptions lead to inaccurate values of maximum strains, location and direction. The stress analysis showed that high tensile strain can be obtained under compressive stresses, and therefore, protection layer design should also consider stresses developed in conjunction with strain.</description>

   <description>Unforeseen ground conditions can have significant impact on the success of any geological project. Therefore, geological site investigation is an essential component of geological field campaigns. Remote sensing techniques have been used extensively for many geological applications, however, their incorporation into geological site investigations have been slow. A framework is required to demonstrate how remote sensing techniques can be incorporated into conventional site investigation practices. Thus, it is the objective of this thesis to assess the contributions of remote sensing datasets and show how to seamlessly integrate these datasets into practical workflows to compliment conventional methods. Case studies using three remote sensing datasets operating at different spatial scales, close-range laser scanning, airborne optical/LiDAR and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), were used.&#xd;
&#xd;
A literature review revealed that close-range 3D laser scanning was a useful tool for the morphological study of geological hand-samples and had been widely applied in the fields of paleontology, rock mechanics and sedimentology. A case study was completed to digitally calculate the grain-size distribution of ore minerals using laser scanning, which produced comparable results to those generated using a scanning electron microscope, the current state-of-practice.&#xd;
&#xd;
The utility of LiDAR reflectance data for improved shadow detection in multispectral images was explored. When combined with the spectral bands as input into shadow classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM), the performance of the classification was improved to greater than 95%. To mitigate the effects of these shadows, four methods of colour correction were tested of which Reinhard’s colour transform performed the best. Shadow mitigation substantially improved subsequent vegetation mapping using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).&#xd;
&#xd;
It was investigated whether SAR backscatter intensity data could be applied to monitoring temporal changes in northern Canada. Results showed that this data was suitable for monitoring ice cover seasonality, seasonal flooding and seasonal vegetation growth. &#xd;
&#xd;
These case studies make evident that remote sensing datasets can be used to enhance geological site investigation. Creation of workflows, in which suitable remote sensing techniques are integrated, for each site investigation application is recommended as future work.</description>

   <description>Exploration for gold in Nunavut has primarily focused in Archean greenstone belts in the north and coastal regions of the territory, resulting in large areas of unexplored terrain. The Kiyuk Lake property is located in the underexplored southwest corner of the Kivalliq Region of Nunavut. Gold mineralization hosted by Proterozoic sediments is rare in the Canadian Shield, so this study endeavors to further the understanding of the enigmatic gold mineralization hosted in such sediments at the Rusty Zone at Kiyuk Lake.  Mineralization is hosted by an immature lithic-wacke cut by thin intermediate dykes that are associated with hydrothermal breccias composed of Fe-carbonate, calcite, calcic-amphibole, Fe-sulphide, and Fe-oxide minerals. Textural and timing relationships suggest that the gold mineralization is post-sedimentary and syn- to post-intrusion of intermediate dykes. Stable isotope thermometry indicates mineralization took place between 450-600oC and geochronological studies suggest that the intrusion and mineralization occurred before or about 1.83 Ga. The mineralizing hydrothermal fluids are postulated to be volatile-rich aqueous solutions exsolved from a source of cooling magmas at depth that interacted with metamorphic fluids, previously in equilibrium with S-rich sedimentary rocks and/or basement rocks. Using basement breaching thrusts faults as conduits, fluid overpressurization along a later normal fault is thought to be the primary cause for the rapid depressurization and temperature decrease that caused Fe-sulphides minerals to precipitate, destabilizing the Au(HS)2- complex and finally depositing gold. Although sub-economic at present, the occurrence of gold in Paleoproterozoic basins such as Kiyuk Lake could signal a new timing of gold deposition for the Canadian Shield; however, exploration is challenged by extensive glacial deposits, limited outcrop, and restricted working seasons. Consequently, exploration must be planned to use integrated techniques to efficiently and effectively evaluate regional targets. Here I show a regional till survey, coupled with geophysical magnetic and gravity surveys and structural interpretation can be used to identify new regional scale targets by statically evaluating target scale and regional scale till surveys in conjunction with multi-element drill core chemistry to determine pathfinder element groups that clearly highlight the Rusty Zone outcropping mineralization and lead to the delineation of new anomalous areas.</description>

   <title>Roles of Arginase-1 in Neural Cells</title>
   <creator>Richmond, Christopher</creator>
   <contributor>Funk, Colin</contributor>
   <subject>Arginase-1</subject>
   <description>Arginase-1 (ARG1) is an essential urea cycle (UC) enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of arginine, proposed to also be involved in pre- and post-natal development and post-injury regeneration of neural cells. Genetic mutations in fundamental regions of ARG1 may cause ARG1 deficiency (ARG1D), a UC disorder (UCD) that results in partial or complete loss of functional ARG1 expression. ARG1D presents with late onset neurological phenotypes in comparison to other UCDs, that include: intellectual and growth retardation, and initial spastic diplegia with progression into paraplegia. Because of prominent arginase-1 expression in the nervous system (NS) during embryonic and post-natal development, subsequent upregulation post-injury to the NS, and unique neurological phenotypes of ARG1D in comparison to other UCDs, we hypothesized that ARG1 has pivotal neurobiological roles. &#xd;
To investigate this, we crossed nestin-cre and Arg1 loxP-flanked mouse strains, effectively creating neural (n)Arg1 knockout (KO) mice, which should congenitally lack functional arginase-1 expression in neural cells. Cre-loxP recombination of Arg1 was determined by PCR genotyping and characterization of the mouse model included protein and mRNA expression analysis of various tissues to confirm NS specific KO of arginase-1. Subsequently, nArg1 KO mice were compared to control mice for assessment of body weight, blood amino acid levels, and stride gait cycle utilizing DigiGait Imaging Systems during 8 to 26 weeks of age. To assess the role of Arg1 post-injury in neural cells a sciatic nerve crush injury (SNCI) model was used. Functional tests were carried out to assay differences in axon reinnervation by assessing return of lost motor and sensory function of nArg1 KO mice compared to control mice. Results suggest no temporal differences in axon reinnervation post-SNCI based on the rate of return of sensory function. Gait abnormalities reminiscent of those observed in ARG1-deficient patients were absent. Our results suggest that an absence of Arg1 in neural cells does not contribute to the phenotypes of ARG1 deficiency, nor is Arg1 likely to be crucial for post-injury axonal regeneration in this particular model, although return of motor function displayed modest delays compared to control mice.</description>

   <description>Teachers in all Canadian provinces, and in many jurisdictions around the world, are required to assess elements of student performance other than academic achievement. In Ontario, these assessments are reported in a section of the report card called “Learning Skills and Work Habits” (LSWH). This dissertation examined Ontario secondary teachers’ assessment practice in relation to the LSWH. Empirical data were obtained through interviews, report cards, and an online survey to provide a better understanding of how teachers define, assess, and grade the LSWH. Relationships between LSWH grades and achievement grades, along with gender differences in LSWH grades were also examined. The first study used semi-structured interviews to establish a baseline understanding of teachers’ LSWH assessment practices, and to inform the development of the survey reported in the third study. The second study used Grade 9 and 12 report card grades from two different school districts to establish the dimensionality of the LSWH grades, to find correlations between LSWH grades and achievement, and to examine gender differences in LSWH grades. The third study focused on a single LSWH (self-regulation) and used interview data, report card data from a third district, and survey data to better understand how Ontario secondary teachers conceptualize and operationalize self-regulation. Findings from the three studies indicate a broad range of assessment practices are present in Ontario secondary classrooms, and that teachers make holistic judgements about students’ LSWH and use those judgements to inform their grading decisions. Findings from this research address a critical gap in the classroom assessment literature and are helpful to school systems seeking to improve teachers’ classroom assessment practices.</description>

   <description>Conversion of light into direct current is important for applications ranging from energy conversion to photodetection. However, there are still many challenges to reach high conversion efficiency and broad spectral coverage. Overall, photodetection through conventional procedures is based on light absorption by a material with a matching bandgap. This traditional approach limits the range of wavelengths that can be detected, it is not sensitive to polarization, and loses accuracy in the infrared range because of thermal noise. In order to design and optimize a photodetector that can overcome those limitations, I first built an instrument to evaluate the functionality of the proposed devices. Different devices and structures were fabricated and tested by means of photodetection in order to clearly identify the origin of the detected photovoltages. Further investigations on rectenna configurations and nonlinear optical rectification process showed promising results for photovoltage generation in a broadband scheme.&#xd;
A photodetector that combines polarization sensitivity and circularly polarized light sensitivity in the near infrared region was fabricated using an ITO-Au hybrid layer. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the device was significantly increased by adding a poled molecular-glass film in a capacitor configuration. The resulting device is capable of detecting light below the ITO-bandgap at ambient temperature without any bias voltage. It does not rely on the photoelectric effect, which is at the origin of the photovoltaic effect in semiconductor devices. It works based on hot electron emission in plasmonic nanostructures. This photodetector, which is amenable to large-area fabrication, can be integrated with other nanophotonic and nanoplasmonic structures for operation at telecom wavelengths.&#xd;
I then show how an array of aligned plasmonic nanorods covalently coupled to molecular rectifiers can also be used as optical nanoantennas to harvest the light and convert it into a DC-potential difference, which may be practical for energy production. I discuss the design, rectification processes, and propos two antenna fabrication procedures: electrochemical deposition and e-beam lithography.</description>

   <description>Background: Sexually and/or gender diverse persons face discrimination and marginalization within and beyond the health care system due to their sexual orientation and/or gender identity. These experiences can lead to poor health outcomes and negative coping strategies. In Ontario, public health nurses (PHNs) could reduce such health inequities by changing their practice and by influencing change within their local public health agencies. Fostering positive spaces using a cultural humility approach is a means through which PHNs could render public health unit spaces safer for sexually and/or gender diverse persons, however; there is a lack of valid and reliable tools for PHNs to assess a cultural humility approach to positive spaces. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis was to advocate for a shift in practice away from cultural competence and towards cultural humility and to test the validity and reliability of modified versions of the Ontario Public Health Association’s (OPHA) personal and workplace tools for perceptions of sexually and gender diverse positive spaces within Ontario public health units.  Methods: The existing OPHA tools were modified based on literature review findings and a cultural humility approach. The tools were tested for face and content validity with a group of expert panelists (N=5) and with Registered Nurses (RNs) (N=5) providing direct services to clients and community partners in public health. To test for construct validity and internal consistency, a cross-sectional online questionnaire was delivered to 1 978 RNs working in public health through email and mailed invitations. Results: An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of the personal tool (N=259) yielded 40-items with a 15-factor solution; 12 factors had a reliability rating of moderate to excellent. An EFA of the workplace tool yielded a 38-item tool with 10 underlying dimensions; eight of these factors had a reliability rating of moderate to excellent. Conclusion: Evidence-informed improvements have been made to the OPHA positive space tools. Study findings offer an initial reference point for the underlying structure of positive spaces in Ontario public health units. These tools, with further improvements and testing, could be used to inform positive space testing in public health units.</description>

   <description>This thesis develops a mathematical model for the hydrolytic copolymerization of caprolactam with hexamethylene diamine (HMD) and adipic acid (ADA) in a batch reactor to produce nylon 6/6,6 copolymer. The reaction mechanism includes hydrolysis of caprolactam and cyclic dimer, polycondensation, polyaddition, transamidation, and ring formation via end biting and back biting. The catalytic effect of carboxyl end groups on reaction rates is accounted for using kinetic and equilibrium parameters from the literature. This model can predict dynamic changes in concentrations of water, caprolactam monomer, comonomers, aminicaproic acid, end groups and degree of polymerization. This model is used to simulate laboratory-scale nylon 6/6,6 batch copolymerization at conditions of industrial interest. &#xd;
To account for the complex influence of water on nylon reaction equilibria, semi-empirical expressions are developed to describe the equilibrium behaviour for the five dominant reactions that occur during nylon 6, nylon 6,6 and nylon 6/6,6 polymerizations. These expressions are developed by considering additional side reactions involving amidine ends, cyclopentanone ends and hydrated carboxyl ends. A subset of these side reactions is also used to extend the rate expression for polycondensation to account for the influence of water on the overall polycondensation reaction. The kinetic and equilibrium parameters in the updated model are estimated using a large body of literature data values that cover a wide range of operating conditions in nylon 6 and nylon 6,6 homopolymerizations. The updated model and new parameter estimates result in good fit to all of the kinetic data. The objective function value for parameter estimation is reduced by 70% compared to its value using parameters of Arai et al. The predictions for linear monomer and end-group give the most improvement in fit. &#xd;
The proposed models and improved parameter values in this thesis will be helpful to guide nylon 6/6,6 experiments and to assist with improved understanding of nylon 6, nylon 6,6 and nylon 6/6,6 polymerization processes.</description>

   <title>Characterization of Variants of Unknown Significance (VUS) in BRCA1</title>

   <subject>Variants of Unknown Significance</subject>
   <description>Approximately 3%-8% of breast cancer patients carry one defective BRCA1 or BRCA2 allele. While the rise of genetic testing have helped identify BRCA mutation carriers, the implication of certain mutations are still unknown. These comprise almost one third of all BRCA variants. These Variants of Unknown Significance (VUS) pose a challenge for clinicians and patients, since a VUS cannot guide treatment or prevention strategies. To solve this problem, our laboratory previously developed and validated a biological assay using gene expression data from EBV-transformed cell lines.&#xd;
&#xd;
This study adapted the previously validated assay for use in the clinic by converting to the NanoString nCounter platform and refining the classifier with k-TSP. The classifier was then applied to cell lines derived from individuals carrying novel BRCA1 variants to provide evidence for the pathogenicity of BRCA1 VUS. The overall accuracy of the resulting classifier was 92%. This classifier’s accuracy in the test set of samples derived from patients of KGH with known BRCA1 pathogenicity was 71%.&#xd;
&#xd;
This classifier provided potentially novel findings about two BRCA1 VUS: c.2050C>T and c.693G>A. All replicate samples tested from patient 43791 (c.2050C>T) and patient 43901 (c.693G>A) had a consensus prediction as not pathogenic. While these predictions provide new evidence towards better characterizing these BRCA1 VUS, they should remain as supplemental evidence that should be used in conjunction with evidence from other sources. Further validation incorporating additional samples is necessary to move this assay forward towards clinical implementation.</description>

   <description>The mortality of wildlife on roads is an aspect of biological and environmental degradation that is often overlooked amidst the plethora of other threats that exist. Yet it is a very real concern, especially for species that are more susceptible to death on roadways, such as the herpetofauna. In this research, I utilized databases of herpetofauna road mortality from two highways in the Frontenac Arch region in eastern Ontario. Data from regular surveys I conducted on a 38km section of Ontario’s Highway 2 (2016 and 2017), as well as previous surveys conducted on the 37km Thousand Islands Parkway (2008 and 2010) were used to explore where and why mortality is occurring in this area. &#xd;
Kernel density analysis for the taxonomic groupings included in this research showed that road mortality was not random along the roads and there was spatial clustering in the form of hotspots. The hotspots of every taxonomic group overlapped in the middle of Highway 2, while hotspots on the Thousand Islands Parkway were more variable. There is an expanse of forest and wetland that intersects with the hotspot areas of Highway 2, and there was some activity on the Parkway where the road intersects this forest and wetland, but mortality is not as significantly clustered as on Highway 2.&#xd;
Regression tree analyses showed that, across roadways, wetland and water-related variables are important factors influencing the location of frog and toad, turtle, and watersnake mortality. An overarching trend from the results of the regression tree analyses was that mortality was generally higher in areas with lower traffic levels and in areas lacking development such as roads and urbanization. This suggests that populations in these areas may be avoiding roads, or are depressed due to prolonged exposure to roads and high traffic.</description>

   <description>The selection of furnace operating parameters during the flash smelting of copper is based on the elemental composition of a blend and does not account for mineralogy, which may impact on the process. Thus, it is important to study the impact of blend mineralogy on flash combustion processes. This thesis investigates the impact of pure minerals, chalcopyrite and pyrite, on the flash combustion behaviour of three mineralogically distinct but chemically similar copper concentrates through experimental test work. In tandem, proof of concept testing of a novel fibre optic probe for monitoring flash combustion reactions was done.&#xd;
	A drop tower reactor was used to study the effect of O2/S stoichiometry on flash combustion processes under 21 different test conditions. Tests were conducted at 950oC with O2/S stoichiometries in the range of 0.8 to 4.0, and a solids feed rate of 3 grams per minute. The results suggest that concentrates with low pyrite mineralization require a higher O2/S stoichiometry to be desulphurized to the target matte composition, and that the O2/S stoichiometry impacts the fraction of dust in the products, the flame temperature as well as the flame brightness. In this work, the impact of mineralogy on flash combustion processes is studied using different monitoring techniques to gain real-time information about the process. Ultimately this information may then be used to optimize the blending process and to adjust the operation of a flash furnace in real time.&#xd;
	Monitoring of combustion reactions was done using emission spectroscopy, where the spectra were acquired through a custom-built fibre optic probe. The two-wavelength method was used to measure the temperature of combusting particles and the integrated intensity was used to measure the flame brightness. This information was found to be useful for identifying feed distribution problems, which are also experienced in commercial scale furnaces. There were no atomic or molecular Cu, Fe, S nor O emission lines or bands in the emission spectrum; however, alkali metal emissions from Na, K and Li were observed. The lack of Cu, Fe, S and O emissions is attributed to the low flame temperatures, which were between 900 and 1500oC. Testing of the sensor in a commercial scale furnace is recommended and is expected to expand the application range of the probe.</description>

   <title>De Quincey and the Christian Experience: The Feeling of Struggle, Depravity, and Doubt</title>

   <description>Abstract&#xd;
&#xd;
The essayist Thomas De Quincey (1785-1859) produced texts that span the literary periods the Romantic and Victorian and a major shift in the Church of England: he was an Evangelically educated youth and an emerging author when Evangelicalism was a sect, the 1790s-1830s, the Romantic period; and he was an established author when moderate Evangelicalism was the dominant force, the mid-1830s-1850s, the Victorian period. This dissertation argues that Romantic Evangelicalism and the belief in the divine component of the self, which would become central to Victorian Evangelicalism, shape De Quincey’s interpretation of the Christian experience. Like Romantic Evangelicalism, he situates depravity as the essential consideration; he extends the divine to humans, like Victorian Evangelicalism; and he identifies the struggle between the depraved and the divine components of the self as a defining characteristic of the Christian experience, establishing a duality that emphasises depravity in a way that approaches Romantic Evangelicalism. The body chapters contend that if De Quincey employs a version of Romantic Evangelicalism’s interpretation of the Christian experience—experience as the feeling of struggle, depravity, and doubt—key texts will be marked by the absence of the divine component and the positive experience of God’s love, and they will contain doubt about the self, other humans, and a loving God. These key texts include the texts on Christianity (1839-1846); the texts on the literature of power, “Letters to a Young Man Whose Education has been Neglected” (1823) and “The Works of Alexander Pope” (1848); the famous autobiographical texts, Confessions of an English-Opium Eater, “Suspiria De Profundis,” and “The English Mail-Coach”; the ground-breaking texts on Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1834-1835); and the texts “Joan of Arc” (1847) and “The Nautico-Military Nun of Spain” (1847), which he ranked highly among all his texts. The body chapters also consider the role of addiction in shaping De Quincey’s interpretation of the Christian experience. The second chapter addresses Evangelical education, the third the literature of power, the fourth the civil war of the self, the fifth doubt in a loving God, and the sixth despair at and hope in Providence.</description>

   <title>The Bachelor of Health Science Online Program: a Look at Program Development Through the Eye of the Curriculum Committee Members</title>

   <description>Delivery of an online education model is a trend that is increasing in popularity in today’s day and age. Although not a recent phenomenon, the technological development within the world of distance education would make it appear as so (McGorry, 2003). Due to the costly expense of university programs and the nature of full-time studies, many students are unable to participate in the traditional in-house university experience (Rasmussen, Northrup &amp; Colson, 2016). Because of this, a large demographic lacks the ability to gain acceptance into professional schools, specifically in health related fields. Offering an online health studies’ program would eliminate this barrier. &#xd;
When developing an online undergraduate program in health studies, it is imperative to maintain a high degree of academic quality. The purpose of this study was to examine the influences of the curriculum on the development of Bachelor of Health Science (BHSc(H)) online program at Queen’s University, through the eye of the curriculum committee members.  &#xd;
Employing a phenomenological inquiry methodology, data was collected through semi-structured interviews with a total of 14 participants who were members of the curriculum committee. The data was transcribed, analyzed and coded. This analysis revealed four major themes: program design, role of the curriculum committee in the program, online program development and innovation, and course development. Differences in the participants’ perceptions tended to reflect the varying roles they played in the development of the program.&#xd;
The main influences on the program design included; the use of a backward design model in which assessments were at the forefront of course development and the intricate mapping of competencies and outcomes. The backward design model was considered to be a very effective approach to development of each individual course and set the stage for the high academic quality of the program. In addition, the unique competency-based framework upon which the program is built allowed the developers of the BHSc(H) program to create something innovative and new to the world of online learning across Canadian universities.  Competency-based education is not commonly found at the undergraduate level and will give the successful BHSc(H) program graduates an edge above their peers in postgraduate studies in the healthcare field. &#xd;
Despite the challenges faced by the program from the get go; fighting against the stigma of online learning, developing traditional hands on assessments in an online format and convincing the graduate schools of the academic quality of the four year online degree, the program development was thorough, rigorous and academically sound. Participants concluded their interviews by outlining their thoughts on the potential success of the program to which they stated that the BHSc(H) program has the potential to be a highly successful route to post graduate studies and to shape the way for future online programs. This program design model might well lead the way for the development of future online programs at Queen’s and across the country.</description>
