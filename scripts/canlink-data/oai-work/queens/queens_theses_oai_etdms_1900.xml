   <description>The subject of Canada’s policy-making in relation to the Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) has been neglected for over half a century. Therefore neither the scope of Canada’s official assistance to the Chinese during their War of Resistance against Japan nor the motivations behind this assistance have been fully explained or adequately contextualized. Through research using archival records and other primary and secondary sources, the thesis sheds light on the ways in which Canadians chose to respond to Chinese efforts to secure an ally against Japan. Revealing unscrupulous opportunism on the Canadian side during China’s struggle against Japan, the thesis contributes to a revisionist trend which takes aim at romantic mythology about Canadians’ virtuous role in the Second World War.&#xd;
From 1931 to 1941, the Government of Canada sought to maintain a neutral position regarding Japanese encroachments in China. This was partly to honour a friendship established in the First World War but also to protect Canadian exporters’ valuable sales of strategic minerals to Japan. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, pro-Japanese sympathy among Canadians eroded and trade with Japan became politically untenable. In 1942, already five years after the beginning of full-scale war between Japan and China, the Canadian government began preparations to provide material assistance to the beleaguered Chinese. Increasing dialogue between Mackenzie King and Chiang Kai-shek, especially communications through Chiang’s wife Song Meiling, nurtured a promising friendship despite King’s unwillingness to commit “the lives of white men” to war in China and apparently ensured that several shipments of arms and munitions were provided to Chiang’s armies. As the research reveals, the assistance was motivated by hopes of cultivating “goodwill” in China that would favour Canadian businesses after the war. However, the official decision to assist China against Japan sparked a new controversy. Doubts about China’s postwar political stability gave rise to questions about the danger that Canadian munitions would be used in an imminent Chinese civil war. Such warnings, as it turned out, were merited. A bloody conflict between the Communists and Nationalists would erupt in China shortly after the end of the Second World War, in part waged with Canadian weapons.</description>

   <description>This thesis analyzes the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems in mobile multi-hop relaying channels. We consider the uplink scenario and quantify the effects of mobile channel impairments such as Doppler Shift due to user mobility per hop, high-power amplifier distortions when amplifying the transmitted/relayed OFDM symbol per hop, as well as the cumulative effects of these impairments over multi-hop relaying channels. It is shown that the resulting inter-carrier interference (ICI) due to the cumulative effects of the phase noise generated by these impairments per hop becomes very significant in a multi-hop relaying communication system, and severely degrades the BER performance of the system. Simulation results agree well with, and validate the analysis.</description>

   <description>Long Term Evolution (LTE) constitutes a significant milestone in the evolution of 3G systems towards fourth generation (4G) technologies. The performance targets promised by LTE makes it an ideal solution to accommodate the ever increasing demand for wireless broadband. LTE's promised performance targets were made possible due to improvements such as a simplified system access architecture and a fully IP-based platform. LTE has also great enhancements in its enabling radio technologies by introducing Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and advanced antenna technologies. In addition, LTE capabilities are further improved with enhanced Quality of Service (QoS) support for multiple data services, such as voice and other multimedia applications.&#xd;
&#xd;
LTE packet scheduling plays an essential role as part of LTE's Radio Resource Management (RRM) to enhance the system's data rate and to support the diverse QoS requirements of mobile services. LTE packet scheduler should intelligently allocate radio resources to mobile User Equipments (UEs) such that the LTE network adheres to its performance requirements. In our work, we perform a performance evaluation of multiple LTE scheduling algorithms proposed for LTE uplink transmission. The evaluation takes place in single and mixed traffic scenarios to exploit the strengths and weaknesses of proposed algorithms. Simulation results illustrated the importance of a scheduler's awareness of uplink channel conditions and QoS requirements in the presence of single and multiple traffic scenarios. Accordingly, we provide recommendations for future scheduling algorithm proposals, and ways to enhance the existing schedulers.</description>

   <description>This thesis investigates the effect of coinfection on the emergence of resistant pathogens.&#xd;
Firstly, a multiple infection model with treatment is derived and the conditions for invasion are established.&#xd;
 The invasion condition is then related to an equivalent and easier to obtain condition, R0, &#xd;
 by applying  the Next-Generation Theorem. Due to its biological interpretation,&#xd;
  a heuristic derivation of R0 as the invasion condition is also given.&#xd;
 Then assuming that resistance comes at a cost to the pathogen, and using a very simple within-host model, we establish under which specific&#xd;
set of biological assumptions we should expect coinfection to increase or decrease R0.&#xd;
Specifically, we obtain that in the no cost of resistance case, reduced transmission case, and increased&#xd;
mortality case, that coinfection  will increase the R0 value and that in the reduced growth&#xd;
and poor competitor case that the effect is indeterminate. We also introduced a method for &#xd;
approximating the intrinsic growth rate when the coinfection efficiency is assumed to be small.&#xd;
Using this method, we show that we obtain the same trend for the cost of resistance cases&#xd;
when comparing our estimate for the intrinsic growth rate for the coinfection case versus&#xd;
the intrinsic growth rate for the single infection case. We also use this approximation to &#xd;
estimate the percentage of resistance as a function of time. Finally, we analyze how both&#xd;
the intrinsic growth rate and R0 respond to a changing treatment rate, compared&#xd;
to the intrinsic growth rate and R0 value in the single infection case. We found that&#xd;
the change in R0 and the intrinsic growth rate can be greater or smaller than the change&#xd;
in R0 or the intrinsic growth rate for the single infection case.</description>

   <description>This thesis presents the design of a high-frequency annular array ultrasound system suitable for medical imaging. To reduce the cost of the system, off-the-shelf parts were used whenever possible. The system consists of four main components; 1) a transmit beamformer, 2) a high voltage pulse generator, 3) an annular array transducer and 4) a receive beamformer. The transmit beamformer and pulser were designed for an 8-channel array but could be easily expanded for larger arrays. The pulser produces monocycle electrical pulses with centre frequencies that could be adjusted from 10-50 MHz and with amplitudes up to 90 Vpp. The annular array transducer has 12 equal area elements and a total active aperture of 6 mm. The transducer array produced pulses with a centre frequency of 20 MHz and 50% bandwidth. The resulting images had a lateral resolution of 172.5 μm at 10 mm and an axial resolution of 180 μm. A new fabrication method was developed that makes it easier to build the array. The receive beamformer was based on a commercial 8-channel analog-to-digital converter. The digital signals were transferred to a laptop where the beamforming was performed in software. This avoided the need to develop custom hardware and allowed it to be reconfigured for different transducers by simply modifying the software. The beamformer used a new interpolation method that reduced the required sampling frequency while maintaining a satisfactory radiation pattern. The system produces images at 10 frames/sec.</description>

   <description>Applications taking advantage of fluorine-fluorine interactions for separations are a recent analytical trend, with benefits in terms of cost, ease of use and specificity cited as advantages of these so-called “fluorous” techniques.  While most current fluorous separations employ columns packed with microspheres, columns based on entrapped microspheres, porous polymer monoliths (PPMs) and open tubes all represent viable alternatives to conventional packed capillaries.  In this thesis, the design, optimization and implementation of fluorous stationary phases based on all three of these new technologies are explored.  Development of methods and techniques using these systems are presented, with factors affecting their performance being examined.  Doing this, the specificity of the fluorous interaction can also be explored, and potential applications for these new materials can be discussed.&#xd;
                                          For the work with entrapped microspheres, the columns that were formed did not prove to have an advantage over those that were unentrapped.  Although affixing spheres within a matrix is known to have benefits in terms of bed stability over repeated use, the inclusion of a polymer coating proved to represent a greater concern for the availability of the bead-based stationary phases.  Layers of polymer forming over the surface were shown to limit the access of analytes to the entrapped microspheres, restricting the usefulness of these materials.&#xd;
                                          The work with fluorous monoliths proved the most successful, providing clear evidence of improved selectivity when compared to analogs made without fluorination.  Fluorous retention specificity was also effectively examined, with secondary effects probed and compared to those that had been discussed for commercially-available fluorous microspheres.  Results showed that the monoliths were very much in-line with what had already been seen for sphere-based systems, with residual substrate character providing only a slight contribution to the observed separations.&#xd;
                                      Finally, development of open-tubular columns based on microstructured optical fibers was the most speculative of the projects discussed here.  The introduction of a fluorous stationary phase through silanization was demonstrated to be an effective method for imparting chromatographic selectivity into these columns, and controllable factors such as treatment protocol and silane character were shown to affect the performance of the resulting materials.</description>

   <description>The use of chemicals to disperse oil spills raises concerns for organisms living below the surface of the water.  While decreasing the surface area of the slick, chemical dispersants increase the amount of oil in the water column, the surface-to-volume ratio of droplets, the partitioning to water of the toxic constituents of oil, and the bioavailability of oil to pelagic and benthic organisms.  Chemical dispersion can increase the exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) by 100-fold.  As a model for a full-scale spill at sea, a wave tank was used to simulate chemical and natural dispersion of spilled oil to determine if the concentrations of chemically dispersed oil were sufficient to cause toxicity to embryos of Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus).  While the hydrocarbon concentrations of dispersed oil from the wave tank were not large, the exposure response relationship was consistent with that of laboratory-prepared dispersed oil.  Additionally, the toxicities of chemically dispersed oil prepared in the lab to Pacific (Clupea pallasi) and Atlantic herring were compared to ensure that the wealth of literature available on Pacific herring could be used for assessing the risk of oil exposure to Atlantic herring.  Exposures to low concentrations of dispersed oil for short periods (2.4 to 24 h) consistently increased the incidence of blue sac disease, and decreased the percentage of normal embryos at hatch, indicating that even brief exposures to oil could be detrimental to the survival and recruitment of herring.</description>

   <description>In 2010, the Government of Canada significantly cut settlement service funding that helps immigrants integrate into Canadian communities. Concurrently, within the last three years, Citizenship and Immigration Canada and the Ontario Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration have funded forty-five Local Immigration Partnerships across the Province of Ontario. Local Immigration Partnerships serve to coordinate efforts and capture capacity within communities to attract and retain new immigrants; however, these Partnerships do not deliver services to immigrants living in the host community. While community-based endeavours to develop sustainable environments for immigrants to live, work and play in are valuable, this particular shift in responsibility from government to community groups and individuals cannot go unnoticed. It is this new local governance of immigration in Canada that will be the focus of this Master’s essay.</description>

   <subject>Bus Rapid Transit</subject>
   <description>A report submitted to the School of Urban and Regional Planning in conformity with the requirements for the degree of Master of Urban and Regional Planning</description>
   <description>Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) is an alternative mode of public transportation that is often considered superior to the conventional bus system. This report offers a comparison of two BRT systems between a newly established one in York Region (York Region Transit’s VIVA) and a well-established one in Ottawa (OC Transpo’s Transitway). The purpose of this report is to examine the strengths of BRT, establish how BRT systems can learn from one another, and determine ways to improve various BRT systems in order to make them more attractive to potential riders. The two BRT systems were compared based on seven common criteria of BRT. It was found that both BRT systems have strengths and weaknesses and can each learn from one another. The most significant difference between the two is the fact that OC Transpo has over 30 km of its own running way, whereas VIVA currently has none; however, York Region Transit is in the process of constructing five running ways. Fortunately, despite its current lack of running ways, VIVA has managed to provide a superior bus service compared to York Region Transit’s conventional bus system. Ultimately, it has been found that BRT is an effective mode of transit that can provide efficient and sustainable transportation and has helped to increase public transit ridership.</description>

   <description>Polymer light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) are unique solid-state light-emitting devices operating on the principle of in situ electrochemical doping and the formation of a p-n junction. Compared to conventional polymer light-emitting diodes, LECs possess some favorable device characteristics, making them attractive candidates for flat panel display applications. However, the underlying operating mechanism of LECs has been the subject of intense scrutiny and debate. The extremely large planar devices demonstrated by Dr. Gao’s group offer an unparalleled spatial resolution for investigating the electrochemical doping process. With time-lapse fluorescence imaging, our group has demonstrated the existence of the electrochemical doping and the p-n junction in an operating LEC. However, the LEC electronic structure has never been adequately studied and understood. In this thesis, the original research on the electrical and optical scanning measurements on extremely large planar LECs is described.&#xd;
A fresh LEC film has, for the first time, been turned on to form a light-emitting p-n junction by biasing a pair of probes that form direct contacts with the LEC film. The quasi-one-dimensional probe tips allow insight into the electrochemical doping mechanism, without being disturbed by imperfections in the pre-deposited electrodes. Time-lapse fluorescence imaging has exhibited p- and n-doping of various shapes and shades, p-n junction electroluminescence, and the effects of bias reversal. The observed doping reaction kinetics suggests that n-doping is reaction-limited whereas p-doping is diffusion-limited. Furthermore, the electric potential and conductivity distributions of extremely large planar LECs have been mapped. The results show that the p-doping is more conductive than n-doping. More importantly, The results provide the first evidence that the p-n junction is indeed a graded one with decreasing conductivity and doping concentration from the electrode contact to the metallurgical junction. In addition, the optical beam induced current (OBIC) measurement has been explored to map the built-in electric field of extremely large planar LECs. This result clearly shows that a large electric field exists only around the junction region rather than in the electrode region. Moreover, the result confirms that the LEC electronic structure is a graded p-n junction.</description>

   <description>Pseudomonas aeruginosa is resistant to many clinically-relevant antibiotics and this is partly attributable to multidrug efflux systems in this organism.  One of these, MexEF-OprN, exports chloramphenicol, fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim and is positively regulated by MexT, encoded by the mexT gene that is located upstream of the efflux genes.  MexT also positively regulates the mexS gene that encodes an oxidoreductase of unknown function and whose loss increases expression of mexEF-oprN.  A null mutation in the mexS gene of P. aeruginosa increased expression of two 3-gene operons, PA4354-PA4355-PA4356 and PA2813-2812-2811.  This increased expression, which paralleled an increase in mexEF-oprN expression in the same mutant, was, like mexEF-oprN, MexT-dependent.  The PA4356 (xenB) gene product is homologous to a xenobiotic reductase in P. fluorescens shown to remove nitro groups from trinitrotoluene and nitroglycerin. As nitration is a well-known result of nitrosative stress, a role for xenB (and the co-regulated mexEF-oprN and PA2813-2812-2811) in a nitrosative stress response was hypothesized and tested.  Using S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) as a source of nitrosative stress, expression of mexEF-oprN, xenB and PA2811 was shown to be GSNO-inducible, though in the case of xenB and PA2811 this was only seen in a mutant lacking MexEF-OprN and only for xenB, this GSNO-inducible expression was dependent upon MexT.  Consistent with MexT being required for mexEF-oprN and PA4354-PA4355-PA4356 expression, MexT bound to their promoter regions. Chloramphenicol, a nitroaromatic antimicrobial that is a substrate for MexEF-OprN and resembles a nitrosated nitrosative stress product accommodated by this efflux system induced expression of mexEF-oprN, but not xenB, or PA2811, and this was dependent upon the MexT regulator. In addition to MexT positive-regulating activity of genes in response to nitrosative stress, MexT also negatively regulates the expression of mexAB-oprM through direct binding to its promoter region and the oprD gene, encoding an outer membrane porin that provides a portal of entry for basic amino acids and carbapenem, whose expression was reduced only by GSNO.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Kinesiology &amp; Health Studies) -- Queen's University, 2011-05-17 13:33:52.518</description>
   <description>Current guidelines suggest that physical activity must be performed at a moderate-to-vigorous intensity (MVPA) and accumulated in bouts of at least 10 consecutive minutes to elicit improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). In the first study we sought to determine whether the duration and intensity of objectively measured incidental physical activity (IPA; activity performed below the designated threshold) was associated with CRF in abdominally obese, inactive men (n=43) and women (n=92). Secondary analyses examined the associations between light physical activity (LPA), sporadic moderate physical activity (MPA; accumulated in &lt;10 minute bouts), and CRF. Both duration and intensity of IPA were positively associated with CRF among inactive, abdominally obese adults. Sporadic MPA, but not LPA, was an independent predictor of CRF.&#xd;
Whereas some observations suggest that sedentary behaviour (SED) is negatively associated with health outcomes, other evidence fails to support this notion. The primary aim of the second study was to clarify the relationships between SED, LPA, and MVPA with 2-hour glucose and insulin resistance in inactive adults (43 men, 92 women) with abdominal obesity. Secondary analyses examined the association between SED, LPA, MVPA and other common cardiometabolic risk factors.  Neither SED nor the physical activity variables were associated with 2-hour glucose or insulin resistance. SED was not associated with any cardiometabolic risk factor; with the exception of blood pressure, LPA was not associated with any cardiometabolic risk factor; and MVPA was independently associated with total cholesterol and triglycerides. &#xd;
Whether IPA is associated with abdominal obesity is unknown. The purpose of study three was to determine the association between IPA and abdominal adipose tissue depots (visceral adipose tissue and subcutaneous adipose tissue) in inactive men (n=42) and women (n=84). Secondary analyses examined the associations between SED, sleep duration, and caloric intake with abdominal obesity. IPA was not associated with any measure of abdominal obesity, nor was LPA.  After control for age and sex, MPA was negatively associated with visceral adipose tissue. SED and sleep duration were not associated with abdominal obesity. Caloric intake was not associated with abdominal obesity after control for age and sex.</description>

   <description>In the last decade there has been increasing research interest in the value of bio-sourced materials from lignocellulosic biomass. The dissolution of cellulose by ionic liquids (ILs) has led to investigations including the dissolution of cellulose, lignin, and complete biomass samples and the in situ processing of cellulose. Rapid quantitative measurement of cellulose dissolution in ILs is difficult. In this work, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of cellulose dissolved in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([emim][OAc]) were subjected to partial least squares (PLS) regression to model dissolved cellulose content. PLS regression was used due to the ease in developing predictive models with this technique in addition to linear regression being ineffectual for modeling when applied to potentially thousands of variables. Applying a normalization data treatment, before regression, generated a model that estimated cellulose content within 0.533 wt%. The methods described provided the basis for a rapid methodology to determine dissolved cellulose content. &#xd;
Development of rapid and facile screening techniques to determine the effectiveness of various ILs as solvents for cellulose or lignin will aid in the development of lignocellulosic based bioproducts. In this work, optical microscopy with and without the use of cross-polarized lenses, was used to monitor cellulose and lignin dissolution in two imidazolium-based and two phosphonium-based ILs as well as n,n-dimethylacetamide/lithium chloride (DMAc/LiCl), demonstrating that this technique could be applied more broadly than solely for ILs. The described optical microscopy methodology was more rapid and sensitive than more traditional techniques, such as visual inspection.  &#xd;
The viscosity of [emim][OAc] (162 cP) is 100 times that of water at 20°C and could inhibit its use as a solvent for cellulose. There is a need for simple, low-cost and environmentally benign methods to reduce the viscosity of ILs to aid in cellulose dissolution. In this work, 4 wt% cellulose dissolved in [emim][OAc] was subjected to 50 psi CO2 and 20 psi N2, as a control environment, at both 50°C and 75°C. After 24 hours a nearly 2-fold increase in dissolved cellulose over the N2 control was demonstrated through the application of a 50 psi CO2 environment for cellulose dissolution in [emim][OAc] at 50°C.</description>

   <description>This research studied the effects of evaporative spray cooling on air-air ejector performance. Experimental data was collected for the purpose of validating computational simulations.  This was done by modifying an existing air-air ejector to accommodate four spray flow nozzles which were used to atomize cooling water. The only parameter that was varied throughout the study was the mass flow rate of cooling water. One single phase (air) case and four spray flow cases where performed and analyzed. The purpose of the single phase experiment was to have a baseline for the air-air ejector performance and isolate the sources of experimental error contributed by spray flow. Three specialized multiphase flow instruments were designed and fabricated by the author to measure, gas phase temperatures, spray mass flow rates, and mixture total pressures. &#xd;
A computational study was performed using the collected experimental data for inlet continuous phase and spray mass flow as boundary conditions for equivalent simulations. A temperature gradient modified turbulence model was written by the author to better predict the mixing rates found experimentally which was used for the duration of this research. Secondary droplet breakup was modeled by the author using empirical correlations following preliminary simulations recognizing the deficiencies of commercially available breakup models. &#xd;
Comparison of experimental and computational cases produced mixed results. It was found that the experimental gas temperature instrument performed poorly for the local droplet fluxes encountered during testing. The spray sampling probe showed more promising results with two integrated mass flows agreeing within 6% of computational simulations. The total pressure probe solved the issue of pressure port clogging, but measurements were representative of mixture density which made an inferred velocity calculation difficult. It was found that evaporation of spray flow before the nozzle exit plane caused a reduction in dynamic pressure and a reduction in back pressure. &#xd;
A full scale simulation was performed to determine the effects of scaling on evaporative spray cooling performance. It was found that for the geometrically similar full scale model, the total droplet surface area and particle residence times scaled up with the model which increased cooling performance.</description>

   <description>The impedance response of a quadrupolar microelectrode array was studied over a wide frequency range to determine whether particles captured at the center of the array could be detected impedimetrically. The microelectrode array (denoted as DEP chip) uses dielectrophoretic forces to concentrate particles at its center. Initial results showed that there was a large electrode-silicon-electrode (ESE) capacitance which dominated at high frequencies. This capacitance was reduced by decreasing the electrode area and increasing the insulating layer thickness. These measures however proved fruitless as this capacitance was still significantly greater then the dielectric capacitance of the chip. This ESE capacitance can be eliminated through the use of a glass substrate so that the dielectric response of the chip dominates at higher frequencies. Since the ESE capacitance prevented experimental validation of impedance spectroscopy as a signal transduction method, computer simulations were performed. These simulations indicated that capture with the current DEP chips would not have a significant impact on the impedance of the chip. Decreasing the electrode gap distance and reducing the area of the electrodes, which is recommended for future work, can remedy this.&#xd;
As measureable changes in the dielectric capacitance of the chip are not possible, a reaction scheme was developed to translate the capture of viral particles into a change in medium conductivity. An ELISA type system was proposed where the viral particles would be functionalized with urease. This uease would then be used to degrade non-ionic urea into ionic products thereby increasing the medium conductivity. A model was formulated to predict the conductivity increase expected for low concentrations, and validated using higher concentrations of biotinylated-urease. Urease from commercial sources proved not to be a viable option as it does not possess a high enough activity to produce a significant conductivity change given the low concentrations of viral particles expected after collection. Urease with suitable activity is produced by the organism Ureaplasma urealyticum which has an activity of 180 000 µmol urea catalyzed min-1 mg urease-1. It is not recommended that this method be pursued further due to technical challenges that would be encountered.</description>

   <description>Interacting with a computer system in the operating room (OR) can be a frustrating experience for a surgeon, who currently has to verbally delegate to an assistant every computer interaction task. This indirect mode of interaction is time consuming, error prone and can lead to poor usability of OR computer systems. This thesis describes the design and evaluation of a joystick-like device that allows direct surgeon control of the computer in the OR. The device was tested extensively in comparison to a mouse and delegated dictation with seven surgeons, eleven residents, and five graduate students. The device contains no electronic parts, is easy to use, is unobtrusive, has no physical connection to the computer and makes use of an existing tool in the OR. We performed a user study to determine its effectiveness in allowing a user to perform all the tasks they would be expected to perform on an OR computer system during a computer-assisted surgery. Dictation was found to be superior to the joystick in qualitative measures, but the joystick was preferred over dictation in user satisfaction responses. The mouse outperformed both joystick and dictation, but it is not a readily accepted modality in the OR.</description>

   <description>The demand for home care increased dramatically in Canada in the past decade. This was because more patients were discharged from hospital, more emphasis was put on health care at the home and community levels, the continuing aging of the population, advancements in technology, and the adoption of a more cost-effective strategies. Though home care is still not a part of Canadian Health Act (CHA) and there are no national regulations for home care, people value the significance of home care. Home care is now one of the fastest growing sectors in Canada’s health care system. With a focus on the elderly population in the province of Ontario, this thesis uses data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS cycle 1.1, 2.1 and 3.1) to examine utilization patterns of home care considering social and geographical factors, the variation within home care service provision, and unmet home care need. The major findings of the thesis are that seniors with poorer health status, older age, female, with lower household incomes, marital status widowed/separated/divorced/single/never married, and living in urban areas are more likely to use home care. At the same time, seniors who are older, with poorer health status, and suffering from chronic condition are in a more vulnerable position to receive the home care they need. A large amount of responsibility was shifted to informal caregivers due to the budget constraints and the policy bias of the government. Access to home care is unequal on a geographical scale. Seniors living in rural and remote areas tend to have more unmet home care  &#xd;
needs than seniors living in urban areas. People living in rural northern regions in Ontario have the least access to home care. Also, seniors living in urban areas have a greater chance of getting government provided care than those living in rural areas. Overall, under the current managed competition model of home care in Ontario, unequal accessibility, insufficient services, an excessive burden on informal caregivers are observed.</description>

   <title>Statistical Inference for the Treatment Effect in Cancer Clinical Trials</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Mathematics &amp; Statistics) -- Queen's University, 2011-05-21 11:07:52.992</description>
   <description>Randomized clinical trials provide the best evidence on the effect of treatment studied. There are different types of measures on the&#xd;
treatment effect, depending on the endpoints of the trials. For a given measure, based on the data from clinical trials, various statistical procedures are available for the inference of the treatment effect in terms of this measure.&#xd;
&#xd;
In a cancer clinical trial with a time to an event as the endpoint, hazard ratio is a popular measure for the relative difference&#xd;
between treatment groups. Most current statistical inference procedures for hazard ratio rely on the proportional hazard&#xd;
assumption, which may not be applicable to practice when it does not hold. Nonparametric confidence intervals for the hazard ratio have been proposed based on the asymptotic normality of the kernel estimate for the hazard ratio, but they were found not very satisfactory in the simulation studies. In the first part of this thesis, the empirical likelihood method is used to construct the confidence interval for the time-dependent hazard ratio. The asymptotic distribution of the empirical likelihood ratio is derived and simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the proposed method.&#xd;
&#xd;
It was also argued that the measure of the relative treatment effect based on the hazard ratio may be difficult to understand by clinicians. An alternative measure called probabilistic index was suggested and the C-index was proposed to estimate this index. However, it was pointed out recently that the expected value of the estimate based on the C-index may be far removed from the true&#xd;
index. In the second part of this thesis, assuming a semi-parametric density ratio model, two new estimates based on respectively the conditional likelihood and weighted empirical likelihood are proposed. Associated confidence intervals are also derived based on the bootstrap re-sampling method. The proposed inference procedures are evaluated by Monte-Carlo simulations and applied to the analysis of data from a clinical trial on early breast cancer.&#xd;
&#xd;
After primary analysis including all patients is completed in clinical trials, analysis by subgroups defined based on covariates of patients is often of interest to assess the homogeneity of treatment effects over these subgroups. The treatment-covariate interaction is usually used for this assessment. In the last part of this thesis, a non-parametric measure is used to quantify the interaction between treatments and binary covariates in the presence of censoring. Asymptotic distribution of the interaction estimates are derived and the bootstrap method is applied to construct the&#xd;
confidence intervals. The proposed approaches are also evaluated and compared by Monte-Carlo simulations and applied to a real data set from clinical trial.</description>

   <description>Countering the trend in contemporary ecocriticism to advance realism as an environmentally responsible mode of representation, this essay argues that the anti-realist aesthetics of literary modernism were implicitly “ecological.” In order to make this argument I distinguish between contemporary and modernist ecological culture (both of which I differentiate in turn from ecological science); while the former is concerned primarily with the practical reform characteristic of what we now call “environmentalism,” the latter demanded an all-encompassing reimagination of the relationship between humanity and nature. “Modernist ecology,” as I call it, attempted to envision this change, which would be ontological or metaphysical rather than simply social, through thematically and formally experimental works of art. Its radical vision, suggestive in some ways of today’s “deep” ecology, repudiated modern accounts of nature as a congeries of inert objects to be manipulated by a sovereign subject, and instead foregrounded the chiasmic intertexture of the subject/object relationship. In aesthetic modernism we encounter not “objective” nature, but “nature-being” – a blank substratum beneath the solid contours of what philosopher Kate Soper calls “lay nature” – the revelation of which shatters historical constructions of nature and alone allows for radical alternatives. This essay looks specifically at modernist ecology as it appears in the works of W. B. Yeats, D. H. Lawrence, and Samuel Beckett, detailing their attempts to envision revolutionary new ecologies, but also their struggles with the limited capacity of esoteric modernist art to effect significant ecological change on a collective level.</description>

   <description>Exposure to the anticonvulsant valproic acid (VPA) is associated with a 7.5% rate of major malformations and a 1-2% incidence of neural tube defects (NTDs).  Although the teratogenic outcomes resulting from VPA use during pregnancy were first identified in the 1980s, the mechanisms by which VPA induces birth defects are not fully elucidated.  Based on evidence in the literature, the studies in this thesis examined the role of in utero VPA exposure on oxidative stress and epigenetic alterations in the developing embryo to provide further mechanistic insight into VPA’s teratogenic pathway.  The first study investigated the role of oxidative stress in VPA-induced teratogenesis.  Using CD-1 mice, catalase was shown to protect against VPA-induced effects on developmental and morphological parameters in both whole embryo culture and in vivo models.  Studies in whole embryo culture demonstrated that markers of oxidative damage were not altered by VPA; however, VPA increased apoptosis in the neuroepithelium, which was attenuated by the addition of catalase.  The second objective addressed epigenetic modifications induced by VPA in an in vivo mouse model.  Maternal administration of VPA resulted in increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4, increased methylation of histone H3K4, and decreased methylation of histone H3K9.  Furthermore, these changes were localized to VPA target tissues including the neuroepithelium, heart, and somites.  Global DNA methylation in the embryo was not altered by VPA.  The final objective was to determine VPA’s effect on a marker of DNA damage, markers of cell cycle proteins, and a marker of apotosis in vivo.  Maternal administration of VPA resulted in a rapid increase of γH2A.X, a marker of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs).  Increased expression of p27KIP1, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, and activated caspase-3, a marker of apoptosis, were observed and these changes were localized to the neuroepithelium of developing embryos.  In conclusion, this thesis supports the hypothesis that VPA-induced increases in ROS production and HDAC inhibition may lead to altered gene expression patterns and consequently teratogenic effects, namely NTDs.</description>

   <description>Mobile Terrestrial LiDAR (MTL) is an active remote sensing technology that uses laser-based ranging and global positioning systems (GPS) to record 3D point location measurements on surfaces within and near transportation corridors, such as along a railroad track or a street. This thesis examines geovisualization for improving user-oriented workflows and also examines geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) for the development of automated feature extraction.  A LiDAR sensor-centric perspective during the data acquisition phase is used to organize data for the user and to transform the data into a 2D reference frame for object-oriented image analysis of MTL data. &#xd;
Organizing the display of MTL data relative to the scanner presented new opportunities for visualization techniques and was an effective method for communicating space that was scanned, or not, in an urban scene. It offers new avenues for quality assessment of MTL survey of urban environments by explicitly displaying gaps in data coverage. A number of techniques for navigating and visualizing data from a sensor-perspective are examined.&#xd;
A novel sensor-perspective transformation of MTL data from three to two dimensions enables analysis of MTL data in common GIS and image-processing environments. GEOBIA software (Definiens’ eCognition) is used to construct a procedural feature extraction workflow. The procedures are constructed with semantic classes, data processing rules and functions that drive geometric segmentation and feature recognition. Geometric regularities in urban scenes and knowledge about spatial and semantic relationships are incorporated into the rule set. The results are fluidly integrated back into a GIS environment.&#xd;
Investigation of alternative approaches to handling MTL data such as those carried out in this thesis are essential if this technology is to see widespread use.</description>

   <title>Constitutional Justice in Africa: An Examination of Constitutional Positivism, Fundamental Law and Rights in Ghana and Nigeria</title>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Law) -- Queen's University, 2011-05-26 10:50:46.13</description>
   <description>This work explores the idea of constitutional justice in Africa with a focus on constitutional interpretation in Ghana and Nigeria. The objective is to develop a theory of constitutional interpretation based upon a conception of law that allows the existing constitutions of Ghana and Nigeria to be construed by the courts as law in a manner that best serves the collective wellbeing of the people. The project involves an examination of both legal theory and substantive constitutional law. The theoretical argument will be applied to show how a proper understanding of the ideals of the rule of law and constitutionalism in Ghana and Nigeria necessitate the conclusion that socio-economic rights in those countries are constitutionally protected and judicially enforceable. The thesis argues that this conclusion follows from a general claim that constitutions should represent a ‘fundamental law’ and must be construed as an aspirational moral ideal for the common good of the people.  The argument is essentially about the inherent character of ‘legality’ or the ‘rule of law.’ It weaves together ideas developed by Lon Fuller, Ronald Dworkin, T.R.S. Allan and David Dyzenhaus, as well as the strand of common law constitutionalism associated with Sir Edward Coke, to develop a moral sense of ‘law’ that transcends the confines of positive or explicit law while remaining inherently ‘legal’ as opposed to purely moral or political. What emerges is an unwritten fundamental law of reason located between pure morality or natural law on the one hand and strict, explicit, or positive law on the other. It is argued that this fundamental law is, or should be, the basis of constitutional interpretation, especially in transitional democracies like Ghana and Nigeria, and that it grounds constitutional protection for socio-economic rights. Equipped with this theory of law, courts in developing African countries like Ghana and Nigeria will be in a better position to contribute towards developing a real sense of constitutional justice for Africa.</description>

   <description>Surfactant-templated, sol-gel based methodologies for the synthesis of tailored, nanostructured, hybrid inorganic–organic materials are incredibly powerful and versatile.  Although growth in this field has been explosive in recent decades, a lot of room remains to contribute to the design and synthesis of new materials, as well as the development of advanced applications.&#xd;
In the work described herein, we firstly explored the synthesis of thick, mesoporous organosilica films and their application as functional coatings for solution-based, fibre-optic heavy metal sensors.  Notably, sub-ppm level detection was observed for the detection of Pb(II) in mixed aqueous–organic media in short timeframes, and progress has been made toward synthesizing organotitania films that would allow for heavy metal sensing in purely aqueous solution.  Furthermore, the utility of these types of surfactant-templated, organically-functionalized, mesostructured coatings has been preliminarily extended to other types of optical devices for heavy metal sensing.&#xd;
We have also explored the use of designer amphiphilic, alkyl oligosiloxane precursors for the tightly-controlled formation of thin, self-templated, hybrid nanostructured films.  Moreover, films bearing uniaxial 2D hexagonal alignment over macroscopic length scales were obtained using polymer-treated substrates to control the interfacial interactions between the film precursors and the substrate surface.  In addition, a relatively mild UV / ozone treatment was employed to remove the alkyl moieties from the films to yield porous materials without catastrophic loss of the as-synthesized, mesostructural order.&#xd;
Lastly, novel chiral, binaphthylene-based, periodic mesoporous organosilica (PMO) materials have been prepared.  With the aim of demonstrating chiral recognition with such materials, porous, co-continuous capillary monoliths have been synthesized and applied as chiral stationary phases in nano-HPLC and CEC.  Notably, enantioselective interactions between our materials and a chiral acetal-based analyte have been observed.  Quantification of these enantioselective interactions in chiral PMOs by isothermal titration microcalorimetry is also being pursued.&#xd;
It has thus been demonstrated that a wide array of different functional materials may be accessed through template-based synthetic strategies.  By varying parameters such the starting monomers, the sol composition, and the interfacial interactions between reacting species and a given substrate (to name a few), the resulting materials may be tailored to meet the demands of new and emerging technologies.</description>

   <description>This dissertation examines the representation of visual arts and artists in two popular Canadian magazines.  It is based on case studies of the Montréal-based Le petit journal, a French-language magazine, and the Toronto-based English-language publication Star Weekly, from 1945 to 1968.  Both were weekly magazines with large readerships and included content for the entire family.  Neither was devoted to visual arts but both carried photographs and articles that engaged with broad issues in the field of visual arts.  As such, they represent a cross-section of ideas and perspectives that is very different from those of daily newspapers or of publications explicitly devoted to the arts.  In addition, both implicitly claimed a national perspective by including articles and information about different regions of Canada.  In this way, although in reality the two publications constitute a central Canadian perspective, inflected in each case by the particularities of their provincial locations, they claimed a national vision.&#xd;
In contrast to existing research concerning art journals and art critics in Canada, my investigation involves the ownership and editorial direction of these two popular magazines.  By analyzing the content of the magazines across more than two decades, I am able to identify shifts in outlook as they occurred and consider them in the context of the period.  I have found that, although there were substantial differences between the two publications, the way that they participated in the construction of ideas was strikingly similar.  In effect, both magazines projected specific notions of the value of artists and visual arts and used this coverage to shape attitudes—to work, gender, immigration, nationalism and a host of other topics.  I argue that the presentation of ideas was rooted in both liberalism and anti-communism, and was informed by inherent self-interest on the part of the owners of the magazines.  In addition, I argue that this perspective was largely hidden within a language of disinterested public service.  Finally, I posit that representations in the popular press shaped opinions and attitudes to visual arts and artists in ways that continue to resonate today, more than forty years later.</description>

   <description>The research question of this report is, how can Belleville, Ontario develop a role in the knowledge economy? A thorough review of Belleville’s city planning documents found no evidence that Belleville’s role is defined for the knowledge economy, highlighting the rationale for this report. It is debated that capitalism goes through distinct phases, and the ascendancy of the knowledge economy implicates a transformation of the structures, principles and mechanisms that underpin capitalist development (Amin, 1995; Macleod &amp; Goodwin, 1999). What is truly defining capitalism of today is how knowledge and learning create economic wealth (Gertler, 2001). Inherently, just as Fordism required Americanism to spur the post-war boom, there is the need to embed the knowledge economy in a knowledge society or a society with a reciprocal institutional ensemble (laws, rules), cultural norms and social relationships (Harvey, 1989; Amin, 1995). In the industrial age, the corporation was the organizing unit of economic growth (Florida, Mellander, &amp; Adler, 2010). In the knowledge economy, the knowledge worker owns the means of production and it is on the urban scale “that the productive capacities of territorial organizations are mobilized” (Brenner, 1999, p. 446). These ideals raise major economic and social policy questions, and have major implications for how to plan our cities. In effect, urban planners provide the tools to facilitate capitalist accumulation, with power to shape the social qualities and properties of urban places. &lt;---------->&#xd;
&#xd;
Belleville, Ontario is a smaller Canadian city that by location, by built form, and with regard to the current planning context is a city of potential in the knowledge economy. Unfortunately, Belleville’s downtown has experienced serious decline as a result of suburban growth; however, current environmental and economic development thinking are creating a climate for downtown revitalization (Filion, Hoernig, Bunting &amp; Sands, 2004). A leading method about urban development in the knowledge economy is Richard Florida’s creative class approach. Florida’s thesis of the creative class approach is that “in the post-industrial era, successful regional economies need to cultivate an ecosystem incorporating high levels of talent, high technology industry concentration, low barriers to entry for talent, and high degrees of social heterogeneity (or tolerance)” (Florida et al., 2010, pp. 2-3). A place can be evaluated for its “fit” to the creative class using a number of performance indices based on these 3Ts of economic development; however, the 3Ts of economic development indices produce dichotomous results by city size. Since the scale of a city-region is generally a competitive advantage in the knowledge economy, the indices produce results that essentially categorize larger cities as winners and smaller cities as losers (Donald &amp; Morrow, 2003). In response, Lewis and Donald (2010), in their work: “A New Rubric for Creative City Potential in Canada’s Smaller Cities,” proposed a new model that will highlight the strengths of smaller Canadian cities. Their alternate path begins with a vision focusing on “quality of life,” specifically livability and sustainability (rather than talent, technology, and tolerance). Lewis and Donald (2010) presented seven measurable indicators of city performance with their new quality of life themed model.&lt;---------->  &#xd;
&#xd;
This study conducted a performance analysis of Belleville, Ontario relative to nine other Canadian cities, as measured by four of Richard Florida’s 3Ts of economic development indicators and six indicators of Lewis and Donald’s (2010) model, which for this report is termed the “quality of life” model. The information for this study is secondary source and based on two sources of evidence. A few chapters should be elaborated on for their sourcing. The information of Chapter 1 is documentary information and is the product of an extensive literature review. Chapter 2’s background information on Belleville is also documentary information and is both the product of an extensive literature review and also uses planning documents that were obtained directly from the Belleville Downtown Improvement Area (See RFA Planning Consultant Inc., 2010; Office for Urbanism, 2006). The primary source of evidence for “Chapter 4: Results” is archival records, which is the data for the performance analysis. This constitutes the data based upon Lewis and Donald’s quality of life model that is from Statistics Canada’s 2006 Census and the 3Ts of economic development data that is from the Martin Prosperity Institute of the University of Toronto. The non-scientific nature of the study’s methodology could not lead to an unequivocal conclusion about what model best fits the community. Nonetheless, the report benchmarks Belleville’s relative performance and identifies Belleville’s relative developmental strengths and weaknesses. In benchmarking Belleville’s relative performance on the economic development indicators, its character was found to be similar to other smaller Canadian cities and distinct from larger urban centres. There were several implications of the results, which revolved around that Belleville should in no way attempt to simulate values, but should be adopting its own development model: one that works to attract creative capital and also builds on the distinct advantage of quality of life. The latter was expressed through the notion for small city solutions to big city problems. &lt;---------->&#xd;
&#xd;
Notable enough that it merited its own section in this report, downtown Belleville was argued on several dimensions as a key resource for Belleville to improve its attraction and retention power of knowledge workers and knowledge-based firms and improve overall quality of life. Downtown Belleville has an award-winning master plan that was adopted by city council in 2006, but subsequently shelved. In response, RFA Planning Consultant Inc. (RFA) was retained by the Belleville Downtown Improvement Area (BDIA) to review and synthesize the master plan’s recommendations. On November 10, 2010 RFA presented a document to the Mayor’s Downtown Task Force on behalf of the BDIA that is built around four downtown development themes to empower downtown planning. The themes are: Downtown as an Attraction, Downtown as 8 - 80 District, Downtown as Residential Area, and Downtown as Employment Centre. This section examined Belleville’s downtown through these themes and rationalized these themes for their relevance in the knowledge economy. Of particular emphasis was that the civic infrastructure of downtown is of an urban character that could attract and retain knowledge workers and facilitate economic growth for knowledge-based firms. However, it was also acknowledged that there is a hierarchy of needs involved in the regeneration of a downtown and that built form is only one of many important considerations. Future research and action to develop Belleville’s role in the knowledge economy will be to further articulate and operationalize a distinct development model for downtown Belleville. While this should be encouraged, it should be carefully directed. Urban creativity strategies have been highly contagious over the past decade, but some have been poorly planned out - putting a knife-edge between regeneration and decline. Interview(s) could have been a source of evidence to validate and enhance the reliability of the report’s findings. However, due to trouble coordinating deadlines interviews were not conducted.</description>

   <description>An understanding of the urban local potential (roof space and solar exposure) is critical for utility planning, accommodating grid capacity, deploying financing schemes and formulating future adaptive policies to take advantage of PV technology's continued price declines. This thesis provides a sequence&#xd;
of methodologies to acquire and pre-process data and access solar PV potential from i) a regional scale, ii) a municipal scale and iii) a municipal district unit. This research explores and confirms the robustness and versatility of the r.sun module within the open source Geographic Resources Analysis&#xd;
Support System (GRASS) for the purpose of solar irradiation modeling at different levels of surface complexity. At the regional scale, the fourteen counties in southeastern Ontario that served as a case study was found to possess over 935,000 acres appropriate for solar farm development, which could provide 90 GW of PV. At the municipal scale, another methodology was developed to provide urban&#xd;
solar PV resource assessments, which is widely applicable throughout the world. The results of the case study indicate that utilities needing to plan for large scale solar electric generation in urban areas can&#xd;
make a rule of thumb estimate. In the absence of advanced computational expertise and high quality remotely sensed data, 30% of the projected area of roofprints can be used as a first pass estimation of the available area for PV installation. Finally, for the municipal district unit, a separate workflow that attains a 95% accurate segmentation from raw and randomly chosen Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data was demonstrated. The solar PV resource assessment on this scale returned 22,000m2 of roof area out of a two dimensional extent of approximately 40,000m2 in building coverage as suitable for the purpose of solar PV installations. With higher integration of urban texture, it was found that the global horizontal irradiation is lower than the regional scale by 30% due to near shadowing effects in downtown Kingston. The three methodologies presented here at three scales provide the foundation to enable automated analysis of solar PV potential and planning for any given region with marginal LiDAR data.</description>

   <description>The intent of this study was to test a mapping method to determine its effectiveness as a tool for planning. The purpose of this tool is to display how policies create areas of protection around natural, cultural and human features. The goal of effectively displaying this information is to assist decision makers to visually assess the extent of protection policies that will effectively protect features and systems. &#xd;
This study was done using the ABC Resource Survey Method presented by Nelson and Lawrence in their book Places Linking Nature Cultural and Planning. This method layers abiotic, biotic and cultural elements of a landscape using GIS mapping. A study area along the Rideau Canal, focused around the Lower Rideau Lake, was chosen with the help of Parks Canada staff. &#xd;
Data used in this study includes: wetlands, waterfront, species at risk, areas of natural and scientific interest, fish habitat, roads and pits and quarries. In Level I, one map was created for each feature, displaying its location within the study area. The information was then carried over into Level II, where the buffers of protection found in local policy documents were added to each feature, creating another set of maps. The seven maps in Level II were then divided into the abiotic, biotic and cultural categories. In Level III the features in each category were combined to create three maps, showing the features in that category and their areas of protection. A final map was created for Level IV which displays all seven features and their areas of protection to display all of the constraints in the study area. &#xd;
 	A number of conclusions were drawn. The first is that with advancements in GIS, this method is simple to use. The availability of accurate data, policy documents and basic knowledge of GIS software are the main components necessary. The use of the different levels is it allows for an efficient overview of all the elements, or select elements that the user may be interested in. Finally, the use of GIS with the ABC method allows for versatility in updating information and levels of protection.</description>

   <description>Biological motion perception, defined as the ability to retrieve information from minimal displays of animal motion, has often been discussed as though it represents a single mechanism. However, depending on the task and details of the stimuli, there have been divergent results as to whether this ability is primarily based on motion or form processing, whether it relies more on local or global information, and whether the knowledge that is applied is learned or innate. These results can be reconciled by a multi-component framework, with five major components: local motion invariant processing, structure-from-motion, figure-ground segregation, action categorization, and style recognition. Several experiments are reported that are motivated by this framework. &#xd;
To investigate the sensitivity of the visual system to local motion invariants, performance was tested on a direction discrimination and a detection task with a point-light walker based on real motion-capture data or a synthetic walker created by Cutting (Chapter 2). When the walkers were displayed normally, performance was equal for both stimuli. However, when the walkers were spatially scrambled, the direction could only be determined for the natural walker, demonstrating that the invariant is found in subtle features of the local motion trajectories. &#xd;
Another experiment examined the difference in attentional distribution due to the task requirements (Chapter 3). Participants looked more often at the feet in a direction task than they did in a gender task, lending support to the idea that useful information can be derived from the local motion of the feet. &#xd;
Finally, Chapter 4 describes a battery of psychophysical tests that assesses each of the components of biological motion perception as independently as possible. The fact that individual performance does not correlate between tests is evidence that they measure different underlying mechanisms, supporting the multi-component framework. &#xd;
In the concluding chapter, multi-component computational models of biological motion perception are evaluated within this framework, and the evidence relating the components to activity in particular brain regions is reviewed.</description>

   <description>Late expression factor 3 is one of the six AcMNPV genes essential for DNA replication identified through transient replication assays. LEF-3 is a single stranded DNA binding protein responsible for the transportation of the viral helicase (P143) into the nucleus of the infected cell. In this study, a protein complementation-based assay was adapted to identify the region(s) of LEF-3 that is (are) involved in LEF-3-LEF-3 protein interactions. The full-length LEF-3, or various truncated LEF-3 regions were fused with Venus1 (N- terminus portions of full length Venus, a modified yellow fluorescence protein) or Venus2 (C- terminus). Venus1 and Venus2 fragments generated a functional fluorescent Venus protein when the two fragments were brought together by protein-protein interaction of the fused LEF-3 constructs. Fluorescence generated by coexpression of full-length LEF-3 fusion proteins confirmed that LEF-3 exists as homo-oligomer. Interaction between the full-length and the N- terminal (aa 1-189) or C- terminal regions (aa 190-385), and between the various truncated LEF-3 regions suggested the complexity of LEF-3 oligomeric structure. LEF-3 constructs deleted for NLS function revealed cytoplasmic fluorescence, suggesting that LEF-3-LEF-3 interactions occur in the absence of DNA or nuclear proteins. Because LEF-3 is essential for nuclear transporting the viral helicase (P143), the ability of LEF-3 to interact with another viral protein was investigated. P47, a sub-unit of the viral RNA polymerase was chosen because it is cytoplasmic when expressed on its own. The interaction between LEF-3 and P47 produced complete nuclear localized fluorescent signals. Overall, the results suggest that there are multiple regions of LEF-3 that are capable of closely interacting, and that multiple domains are likely involved in the oligomerization of full-length LEF-3. The interaction of LEF-3 with P47 suggests that P47 may be another LEF-3 cargo protein.</description>

   <title>Role of NMDA in the Visual Working Memory of the Macaque Monkey</title>

   <description>Working memory refers to the ability to retain information for short periods of time to guide future behavior. This type of short-term memory has been shown to play an important role in mental disorders such as schizophrenia and therefore further investigations into the neural basis of this cognitive function may aid in the study of disease states where this cognitive function is defective. &#xd;
	A likely neural correlate of working memory has been identified in the persistent neural activity observed during the memory retention intervals of various behavioral tasks. Computational and cellular physiology has suggested that this persistent activity depends on NMDA receptor activation. Indeed, pharmacological studies on both human and animal subjects have reported a significant decrease in working memory task performance following the administration of NMDA-antagonists such as ketamine. However, the task and experimental design of these previous studies have not been ideal, and have therefore only shown equivocal evidence that NMDA-antagonists impair working memory, especially its capacity. Here we aimed to determine the effect of low-dose ketamine injection (0.25-mg/kg and 0.50-mg/kg IM) on the performance of macaque monkeys on a visual sequential comparison task, a task whose performance has minimal influence from other cognitive functions besides working memory. &#xd;
	All monkeys showed a detrimental effect of ketamine administration on visual working memory performance, either at higher ketamine doses or with high memory loads. There was also an effect on performance in sessions without a memory component, indicating that the effect of ketamine was no limited to working memory maintenance. &#xd;
	Although the effect of ketamine on memory load varied per animal, this study provides solid evidence in support of the hypothesis that working memory maintenance is dependent on NMDA receptor integrity.</description>

   <description>The boreal forest of Canada extends across 58% of Canada’s land area providing a large range of ecosystem services including flood control, water filtration, and carbon storage. Despite conservation efforts to protect this ecosystem, the boreal region is still under stress from global stressors including climate change. Anthropogenic climate-change is expected to raise temperatures and decrease precipitation over much of the boreal region increasing the duration and magnitude of droughts. This potential change to a more arid climate could have drastic affects on water levels and stream flows across much of the boreal region. Changes in hydrology, as a consequence of anthropogenic climate change, may result in large changes to aquatic ecosystems. To assess the susceptibility of lakes to climate in northwestern Ontario over the past two millennia, sediment cores from a headwater lake were obtained from near-shore cores to reconstruct changes in drought.&#xd;
The cores were located at a depth where changes in pelagic and benthic diatom assemblages (P: B boundary) were apparent in modern-day sediments because the location has been shown to be susceptible to change. The lake chosen for reconstruction was Gall Lake, a small (surface area = 9 ha, max depth = 18 m, mean depth = 8.5 m), mesotrophic lake (total phosphorus (TP) level of 12.3 μg/L, July 2008), with a gentlysloping eastern basin. This headwater lake in the Winnipeg River Drainage Basin (WRDB) is part of a hydrologically-rich region that is expected to experience increased aridity. Multivariate analysis of diatom assemblages over the past two millennia suggested that the instrumental record does not encompassed the natural variability of this system. The largest decreases in diatom-inferred (DI) depth were synonymous with iii the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), a phenomenon not yet observed this far northeast in North America. The MCA has been proposed as a surrogate for climate change over the next century, therefore the prolonged  aridity observed in Gall Lake could aid in the calibration of general circulation models currently used to forecast changes in climate, as well as a scenario that can be used to develop adaptation strategies to future environmental change.</description>

   <title>Pain Communication in Ethnically Concordant and Discordant Dyads</title>

   <description>While ethnicity is often regarded as a factor in pain experience and expression, ethnic pain research has almost exclusively focused on the intrapersonal dimension of the pain experience and failed to recognize the complex interpersonal nature of the pain experience. The Sociocommunications Model of Pain (Craig, 2009; Hadjistavropoulos &amp; Craig, 2002; Hadjistavropoulos, Craig, &amp; Fuchs-Lacelle, 2004) states that pain behaviours serve as both expressions of the inner experience and communications to other people, and the observer must take into account the social contexts in which the pain expression and report occur.  Research in the recent decade has documented reliable evidence that ethnic minorities suffer disproportionately from undertreatment of pain compared to nonminority, but studies examining factors that contribute to such disparities have seldom directly considered the sociocultural context in which the pain experience and assessment take place. This dissertation has two studies. The primary objective of Study 1 is to compare pain report and behaviours in an ethnically concordant versus discordant environment. The primary objective of Study 2 is to investigate the impact of ethnic concordance on the accuracy of observer’s assessment of pain. The Chinese ethnic group was chosen as the focus of the present research because it is the largest ethnic group in Canada and also this group has received little attention in ethnic pain research. Overall, results indicate that ethnic concordance between the person in pain and the observer would influence the sufferer’s pain expression and the observer’s pain assessment. The findings support the Sociocommunications Models of Pain and suggest the importance of considering the interpersonal dimension of the pain experience.</description>

   <description>SuperCDMS, the next stage of the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS), uses cylindrical germa-&#xd;
nium crystals as particle detectors to measure phonon and ionization signals resulting from particle&#xd;
interactions. The aim of CDMS is to identify and measure interactions from dark matter particles&#xd;
(WIMPs). Phonons produced during a particle interaction are absorbed by sensors on the detector&#xd;
surface and are measured through the change in the sensors' temperature dependent resistance.&#xd;
Electrodes on the detector surface create an electric  eld causing charges released during an inter-&#xd;
action to drift through the detector and produce an ionization signal. Surface events, which are&#xd;
interactions that occur within a few  m from the electrodes, cause a reduced ionization signal due&#xd;
to di usion of some of the initially hot charge carriers into the electrode. Because the ability of&#xd;
CDMS to discriminate between a WIMP interaction and background radiation is based on the ratio&#xd;
of phonon to ionization energies, surface events cause a signal similar to a WIMP interaction and&#xd;
are currently the largest source of background.&#xd;
A detector test facility at Queen's University has been commissioned to characterize detectors&#xd;
and test new detector technology. Multiple detectors have been characterized and many tungsten&#xd;
samples have been measured. Two sets of experiments were performed to test new detector designs.&#xd;
To possibly reduce surface events, an insulating layer was deposited on a germanium detector be-&#xd;
neath the electrode to prevent back di usion of charge into the electrode. To possibly simplify the&#xd;
phonon sensor production process, di erent cryogenic glues were used to attach silicon wafers with&#xd;
a tungsten  lm to the crystal surface and phonon propagation through these glues was measured.&#xd;
The most e ective cryogenic glue for coupling tungsten samples to CDMS detectors was found to&#xd;
be Araldite epoxy. Both experiments were successful at measuring interactions. Energy calibrations&#xd;
were performed on both charge and phonon sensors. Further research is required to determine the&#xd;
success of reducing surface events with an insulating layer.</description>

   <title>The Role of Aldehyde Dehydrogrenase 2 In Nitrate Tolerance: Investigation of Low Potency Nitrates and Cross Tolerance</title>

   <description>Organic nitrates such as glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) are commonly used to treat cardiovascular disease. They are prodrugs that require bioactivation for pharmacological activity. Currently, there are two proposed pathways of organic nitrate activation: a high-affinity pathway for high-potency nitrates (GTN and pentaerythrityl tetranitate) and a low-affinity pathway for low-potency nitrates (isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) and isosorbide mononitrate). A major limitation in the utility of organic nitrates is the rapid onset of tolerance during chronic treatment. Inhibition of the enzymes responsible for bioactivation has been put forward as the major cause of tolerance, and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) has been proposed as the primary enzyme responsible for bioactivation in the high-affinity pathway. ALDH2 activity is decreased in GTN-tolerant tissues and it has been suggested that ALDH2 inactivation is the underlying cause of GTN tolerance. However, several aspects of this hypothesis are problematic. My objective was to develop an in vivo model of ISDN tolerance and to use this model to examine the effects of chronic ISDN treatment on ALDH2 activity and on organic nitrate-induced vasodilation. The hypothesis of my research is that the reduced potency of GTN caused by ISDN tolerance is mediated by a mechanism independent of ALDH2 inactivation. ISDN tolerance was induced in rats using an in vivo model in which animals were exposed to 0.8 mg/hr ISDN for 24-96 hr. ALDH2 activity was measured in liver mitochondrial fractions and tolerance was assessed in isolated aortic preparations. There was no inhibition of mitochondrial ALDH2 activity in ISDN-treated animals. However, chronic treatment with ISDN resulted in parallel rightward shifts of both the ISDN and GTN concentration-response curves, which increased with increased duration of exposure&#xd;
iii&#xd;
to ISDN. Concentration-response curves for acetylcholine (ACh), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), and diethylamine NONOate were unchanged in ISDN-treated animals. The model of chronic ISDN treatment results in cross tolerance to GTN but does not affect ALDH activity. The data presented in this study indicate no role for ALDH2 in the development of nitrate tolerance.</description>

   <description>This project analyzes contemporary black diasporic writing in Canada, arguing that Dionne Brand, Austin Clarke and Tessa McWatt evince a unique form of double-consciousness in their writings. Their work transforms African-American double-consciousness by locating it simultaneously within both the black diaspora and the practice of Canadian multiculturalism. The objective of this project is to offer a critical framework for situating these writers within the legacy of both Black Atlantic and Canadian cultural production. These writers do not aim to resolve their double-consciousness but rather dwell within that contradictory doubleness and hyphenation, forcing nation and diaspora to contend with one another in a discomfiting and unsettling dialogue.&#xd;
These authors employ the absences of the black diaspora to imagine new forms of black cultural production, multicultural citizenship and national identity. Their works produce a grammar of diasporic double-consciousness that locates the absented origins of diaspora within Canada. Brand’s depiction of temporality and Clarke’s tracing of movement explore the continuities between nation and diaspora while re-membering neglected aspects of the history of black Canada, such as the life and death of Albert Johnson. McWatt extends this blackening of nation by depicting coalitions between diasporic, indigenous, raced and sexed subjects. These authors transform hegemonic Canadian narratives of nation by dwelling in the hyphen, while their evocation of memory, absence, trauma, and desire gives blackness new meaning and legitimacy.</description>

   <description>This dissertation examines novels that use terrorism to allegorize the threatened position of the literary author in contemporary culture.  Allegory is a term that has been differently understood over time, but which has consistently been used by writers to articulate and construct their roles as authors.  In the novels I look at, the terrorist challenge to authorship results in multiple deployments of allegory, each differently illustrating the way that allegory is used and authorship constructed in the contemporary American novel.&#xd;
	Don DeLillo’s Mao II (1991), first puts terrorists and authors in an oppositional pairing.  The terrorist’s ability to traffic in spectacle is presented as indicative of the author’s fading importance in contemporary culture and it is one way that terrorism allegorizes threats to authorship.  In Philip Roth’s Operation Shylock (1993), the allegorical pairing is between the text of the novel and outside texts – newspaper reports, legal cases, etc. – that the novel references and adapts in order to bolster its own narrative authority.  Richard Powers’s Plowing the Dark (1999) pairs the story of an imprisoned hostage, craving a single book, with employees of a tech firm who are creating interactive, virtual reality artworks.  Focusing on the reader’s experience, Powers’s novel posits a form of authorship that the reader can take into consideration, but which does not seek to control the experience of the text.  Finally, I look at two of Paul Auster’s twenty-first century novels, Travels in the Scriptorium (2007) and Man in the Dark (2008), to suggest that the relationship between representations of authors and terrorists changed after 9/11.  Auster’s author-figures forward an ethics of authorship whereby novels can use narrative to buffer readers against the portrayal of violent acts in a culture that is suffused with traumatizing imagery.</description>

   <description>Laser micromachining has become increasing prominent in various industries given its speed, lack of tool wear, and ability to create features on the order of micrometres. Inherent stochastic variations from thermal ablation along with detrimental heat effects, however, limit the feasibility of achieving high precision. The high number of control parameters that make laser micromachining versatile also hinders optimization due to high exploration time. The introduction of high intensity nonlinear ablation leads to more precise cuts but at a much higher, often restrictive, cost.&#xd;
The work here shows that by combining an imaging technique frequently used in ophthalmology called optical coherence tomography (OCT) with a machining platform, in situ observation of ablation can be made. This combination, known as in-line coherent imaging (ICI), allows information to be gathered about the dynamics of the ablation process. Experimental results show that quality cutting of silicon can be achieved with thermal ablation and at a wavelength of 1070 nm. This result is surprising as silicon absorbs this wavelength very weakly at room temperature. It is shown here that a nonlinear thermal dependence in absorption allows a cascaded absorption effect to enable machining. With the aid of ICI, the model shown here is able to accurately predict the thermal ablation rate and help understand the ablation process. The high quality cutting achieved allows for a more cost efficient alternative to current techniques using ultraviolet diode-pumped solid state (UV DPSS) systems. &#xd;
Where thermal effects such as heat-affected zones (HAZ) cannot be overcome, high intensity nonlinear ablation allows the processing of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) for high frequency arrays (used in ultrasound applications) at speeds two orders of magnitude greater than found in the literature, and potential feature sizes (&lt; 100 µm) in polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) unachievable by thermal ablation. The ablation mechanism here is Coulombic explosion (CE), which is a non-thermal process. Coupled with demonstrated manual and automatic feedback abilities of ICI, the processes shown here may open up new avenues for fabrication.</description>

   <description>I present a detailed study of many-body effects associated with the interband 1s transition and intraband 1s-2p transition in two- and three-dimensional photo-excited semiconductors. I employ a previously developed excitonic model to treat effects of exchange and phase space filling. I extend the scope of the model to include static free-carrier screening.  I also develop a factorization scheme to obtain a consistent set of excitonic dynamical equations.  The exciton transition energies are renormalized by many-body interactions, and the excitonic dynamical equations provide simple expressions for the individual contributions of screening, phase space filling and exchange.&#xd;
&#xd;
	The effects of exchange and phase space filling are quantified by a set of excitonic coefficients.  I first calculate these coefficients analytically by omitting screening effects.  In contrast, the screened coefficients involve multi-dimensional integrals which must be evaluated numerically.  I present a detailed discussion of the numerical methods used to evaluate these integrals, which include a novel algorithm for segmenting multi-dimensional integration regions.&#xd;
&#xd;
	The excitonic model correctly predicts the blue shift and bleaching of the 1s exciton resonance due to exchange and phase space filling. Free-carrier screening is found to enhance these effects by lowering the exciton binding energy. In contrast, the effects of free-carrier screening on the 1s-2p transition energy are more subtle.  In the absence of free-carrier screening, exchange and phase space filling lead to a blue shift of the transition energy.  However, screening decreases the 1s binding energy faster than the 2p binding energy, which in turn decreases the transition energy.  Thus, screening effects oppose exchange and phase space filling, and the overall magnitude and sign of the 1s-2p transition energy shift depends on the free-carrier density. Specifically, for low-moderate excitation densities exchange and phase space filling can be dominated by screening, leading to a net red shift of the transition energy. The results for two- and three-dimensional systems are qualitatively similar, although the magnitudes of the shifts are much smaller in three dimensions.</description>

   <description>A numerical model of a solid oxide fuel cell electrode is presented. Using an already established algorithm for dropping spheres as a base, alterations are made to the algorithm to increase the realism of the model. Two changes are analyzed in detail: the ability to drop pore former particles, and the use of pre-agglomerated solid particles. These changes are characterized by their impact on mean pore size, tortuosity, and effective diffusivity. As pore former volume fraction is increased, so too are mean pore size and tortuosity. A higher mean pore size has a beneficial effect on effective diffusivity due to Knudsen effects, while a higher tortuosity has a detrimental effect on effective diffusivity. The impact of mean pore size and tortuosity on diffusivity generally balances and if the impact of porosity is ignored, pore former volume fraction does not greatly affect effective diffusivity. As pore former particle size is increased, mean pore size and tortuosity also increase. Similarly to before, the effects of mean pore size and tortuosity balance. However, effective diffusivity is shown to decrease slightly with an increasing pore former particle size, suggesting a change in tortuosity has greater impact on diffusivity than a change in mean pore size. For a domain constructed with pre-agglomerated particles, the tortuosity and mean pore size were both noticeably larger than when no pre-agglomerated particles are used. Effective diffusivity was only slightly higher for a domain constructed with pre-agglomerated particles than with no pre-agglomerated particles. It is also shown that the relationship of effective diffusivity with porosity for a domain constructed with pre-agglomerated particles does not fit the correlation proposed by Berson et al. [1] for low porosity structures. A secondary goal of this work is to examine pore size measurement techniques, and present a novel technique that allows the determination of a local pore size, and therefore, a local Knudsen number. Results from the local pore size technique do not match those of the random walk method and so although the novel technique may prove to be a good starting point, it is deemed not yet suitable for use.</description>

   <description>There is no doubt that relevant and up-to-date elementary school curriculum is vital for the adequate education and socialization of youth, however, when a society is characterized by ideological pluralism and multiple visions of morality the debates over curriculum can be acrimonious and tempestuous. These debates are particularly heated when sex education is concerned since adults in Western society have a longstanding cultural discomfort with child and adolescent sexual knowledge and, more specifically, there is a strong belief that sexual knowledge compromises the “natural” innocence and ignorance of young people. This research focuses on a debate that occurred in Ontario in April and May of 2010 after the Government attempted to revise Health and Physical Education curriculum for grades 1-8, the subject that contains sex education.  Following considerable backlash, the Ontario Premier shelved the proposed revisions a mere 54 hours after the curriculum was publicized.&#xd;
What led to this curriculum being received so poorly by the public and what were the contributing factors that led to this abrupt reconsideration? My research examines the debate that the new sex education curriculum produced and draws attention to the ways in which the deep seated anxieties of adults regarding adolescent and child sexual knowledge were able to overpower the voices of researchers and educational experts who were promoting the revisions. Some adults were concerned about the way that the curriculum presented a particularly liberal vision of sexual morality and argued that the new content would corrupt, mislead, and confuse youth. Though there were some individuals and groups who supported the revisions, arguing that they were relevant, necessary and overdue, their voices were not as organized or influential as the religious and social conservatives who dominated the debate. I argue that the proposed revisions to the Ontario sex education curriculum failed to gain public support because of the Government’s inability to adequately prepare for and mediate the Province’s competing liberal and conservative sexual ideologies. In my defense of the abandoned revisions, I explore how they failed to gain support not only because of the vociferous opposition of conservative religious groups who did not want to see a more liberal vision of sexual morality in the curriculum, but also due to a longstanding cultural discomfort with child and adolescent sexual knowledge and an unwillingness to fully affirm non-heterosexual identities and practices within the education system.</description>

   <description>There has been a significant increase in the incidence of musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) and the costs associated with these are predicted to increase as the popularity of computer use increases at home, school and work. Risk factors have been identified in the adult population but little is known about the risk factors for children and youth. Research has demonstrated that they are not immune to this risk and that they are self reporting the same pain as adults. The purpose of the study was to examine children’s postures while working at computer workstations under two conditions. One was at an ergonomically adjusted children’s workstation while the second was at an average adult workstation. A Polhemus Fastrak™ system was used to record the children’s postures and joint and segment angles were quantified. Results of the study showed that children reported more discomfort and effort at the adult workstation. Segment and joint angles showed significant differences through the upper limb at the adult workstation. Of significance was the strategy of shoulder abduction and flexion that the children used in order to place their hand on the mouse. Ulnar deviation was also greater at the adult workstation as was neck extension. All of these factors have been identified in the literature as increasing the risk for injury. A comparison of the children’s posture while playing at the children’s workstation verses the adult workstation, showed that the postural angles assumed by the children at an adult workstation exceeded the Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA) recommendations. Further investigation is needed to increase our knowledge of MSD in children as their potential for long term damage has yet to be determined.</description>

   <description>The multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) and MRP2 mediate the ATP-dependent cellular efflux of a diverse set of organic molecules including many glutathione (GSH) conjugates.  In the present study, a series of GSH conjugated quinones (some of which have been shown to be toxic) were investigated for their ability to interact with human MRP1 and MRP2 using membrane vesicles enriched for these transporters.Several structurally and biologically distinct classes of endogenous (e.g. estradiol) and exogenous (e.g. hydroquinone (HQ),N-methyl-α-methyldopamine (N-Me-α-MeDA), and caffeic acid (CA)) GSH conjugated metabolites inhibited both MRP1- and MRP2-mediated vesicular transport of the prototypic MRPsubstrate (17β-estradiol-17β-D-glucuronide (E217βG)).  The relative inhibitory potencies of the metabolites with respect to MRP1 versus MRP2 differed by approximately 10-fold, with the exception of4-hydroxy-2-(glutathion-S-yl)-17β-estradiol (4-OH-2-GS-E2), which differed by 300-fold.  The catechol estradiols, N-Me-α-MeDA, and CA metabolites competitively inhibited MRP1-mediated E217βG transport and thus, are potential substrates for this transporter.  The estradiol metabolites 2-hydroxy-1-(glutathion-S-yl)-17β-estradiol(2-OH-1-GS-E2) and 4-OH-2-GS-E2were bothsubsequently shown to besubstrates of MRP1 and MRP2by means ofa substrate depletion assay and a vesicular accumulation assay using HPLC with electrochemical detection.  Transport of 2-OH-1-GS-E2 by MRP1 was inhibited by several MRP1 substrates (e.g. E217βG, leukotriene C4, and GSH disulfide) and modulators (e.g. MK571 and S-decyl-GSH).  The chemically reactiveGSH-conjugated HQ metabolites also inhibited MRP1-mediated vesicular transport of E217βGwith IC50values ranging from 3 – 30 μM.  To determine whether these compounds might modify MRP1, MRP1-enriched membrane vesicles were incubated with 2,5-(glutathion-S-yl)-hydroquinone (2,5-GS-HQ) and then immunoblotted with a MRP1-specific monoclonal antibody.An apparentreduction in the electrophoretic mobility of immuno-reactive bands relative to untreated vesicles was observed.  However, subsequent limited trypsin digests did not show any differences in the digestion profiles between 2,5-GS-HQ-treated and control vesicles, suggesting no significant differences in protein structure with respect to accessible trypsin cleavage sites.  Further experiments are needed to demonstrateMRP1 adduction by 2,5-GS-HQ.In conclusion, the data presented here are the first to show that reactive GSH-conjugated catechol and quinone metabolites can be substrates and modulators of MRP1 and MRP2 in vitro.</description>

   <description>This report evaluates the quality of urban design in two contemporary recreation facilities, the Brampton Soccer Centre (BSC) and Cassie Campbell Community Centre (CCCC). Both facilities are located in the City of Brampton, a suburban community within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Using criteria adapted from the Urban Design Compendium, a British best practices manual for urban design, the two case studies are evaluated then compared with one another. The criteria have been further augmented through a comprehensive literature review of books and scholarly articles relating to the planning and design of indoor and outdoor recreation facilities. Ultimately, the evaluation will be utilized to identify pertinent lessons from the case studies, which can then be applied to future development initiatives of recreation facilities in Canada and abroad.</description>

   <description>Co-delivery of the embedded growth factor-loaded microspheres and adult stem cells in a hydrogel matrix was studied for its potential as a cell-based therapeutic strategy for cartilage regeneration in partial thickness chondral defects.  A photopolymerizable N-methacrylate glycol chitosan (MGC) was employed to form an in situ gel that was embedded with two formulations of growth factor-loaded microspheres and human adipose-derived stem cells (ASC).  The polymeric microspheres were used as a delivery vehicle for the controlled release of growth factors to stimulate differentiation of the ASC towards the chondrocyte lineage.  The microspheres were made of amphiphilic low molecular weight (Mn &lt; 10,000 Da) poly(1,3-trimethylene carbonate-co--caprolactone)-b-poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(1,3-trimethylene carbonate-co--caprolactone) (P(TMC-CL)2-PEG)). This triblock copolymer is solid below 100C, but liquid with a low degree of crystallinity at physiological temperature and degrades slowly, and so acidic degradation products do not accumulate locally.  Bone morphogenetic protein-6 (BMP-6) and transforming growth factor-3 (TGF-3) were delivered at 5 ng/day with initial bursts of 14.3 and 23.6%, respectively.  Both growth factors were highly bioactive when released, retaining greater than 95% bioactivity for 33 days as measured by cell-based assays.  To improve ASC viability within the MGC vehicle, an RGD-containing ligand was grafted to the MGC backbone. Prior to chondrogenic induction within the MGC gel, ASC viability was assessed and greater than 90% of ASC were viable in the gel grafted with cell-adhesive RGD peptides as compared to that in non-RGD grafted gels.  For ASC chondrogenesis induced by the sustained release of BMP-6 and TGF-3 in MGC gels, the ASC cellularity and glycosaminosglycan production were similar for 28 days.  The ratio of collagen type II to I per cell (normalized to deoxyribonucleic acid content) in the microsphere delivery group was significantly higher than that of non-induced ASC or with soluble growth factor administration in the culture media, and increased with time.  Thus, the co-delivery of growth factor-loaded microspheres and ASC in MGC gels successfully induced ASC chondrogenesis and is a promising strategy for cartilage repair.</description>

   <description>Focusing on Queen’s University in the core of Kingston, Ontario, Canada, this research develops an understanding of Queen’s University students’ travel behaviour, their experiences while cycling to Main Campus, and of the best approaches to encouraging cycling or making it a more positive experience. The results of this research are grounded in a web-based survey of Queen’s University students, contextualized by a literature review. With a sample of 104 respondents, results show that females  (71 percent) were more likely than males (50 percent) to report that vehicle traffic made them feel less safe on the journey to school. However, a majority of males (69 percent) as well as females (84 percent) reported that they took detours from the most direct route in order to avoid traffic. In terms of encouraging cycling, there was no stark variability in preferences across the sexes. The most preferred options were related to bike parking management and infrastructure, specifically, security from theft and providing painted bike lanes. Three recommendations were made to Queen’s University and/or the City of Kingston based on the survey results: provide improved bike parking options, provide cycling infrastructure, and continue to plan for pedestrians yet also focus on developing a bicycle-friendly Main Campus. Next steps include: further statistical analyses including more data collection to generate a larger sample, reviews of the City of Kingston Official Plan and the Queen’s University Campus Plan, and interviews with campus and City planners to better contextualize the recommendations.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, History) -- Queen's University, 2011-06-12 13:50:46.867</description>
   <description>In the eleventh and twelfth centuries southern Italy passed irrevocably out of Byzantine control and into Norman control, at roughly the same time as the Roman papacy and the Christians of the East were beginning to divide into what we now know as the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches. Historians have typically viewed the history of southern-Italian monasticism in this period around the notion of a cultural conflict between Latins and Greeks, either arguing for or against the idea that the Italo-Normans had a policy of ‘latinisation’ with regards to Eastern-rite monasteries. This thesis will argue, however, that this conceptual framework obscures more important long-term economic and social factors that affected Germany, Italy and Byzantium&#xd;
alike.&#xd;
Having outlined the political and social context of southern-Italy in the eleventh and twelfth centuries in Chapter 1, Chapter 2 will demonstrate the manner in which southern-Italian monasticism was firmly embedded into a network of cultural and social contacts in the broader Mediterranean world, and especially with Byzantium, even during the Norman domination. Chapter 3 will focus on the fundamental patterns of southern-Italian monastic change in the early&#xd;
Middle Ages, emphasising the gradual movement from informal asceticism to organised monastic hierarchies. Chapter 4 will set forth the essential irrelevance of viewing this structural change in terms of ‘Latin’ and ‘Greek’ identities, underlining the point that the distinction is largely meaningless in the context of monastic change. Chapter 5 will explain by contrast the far greater&#xd;
significance of economic and social expansion to monastic change in both ‘Latin’ and ‘Greek’ areas of the Mediterranean, and especially southern Italy. Finally, Chapter 6 will show that consolidation in southern-Italian monastic structures was not simply part of a centrally-directed papal reform movement, but part of a wider range of innovations undertaken on a local basis throughout the peninsula and the rest of the Mediterranean, with a considerable range of&#xd;
influences.&#xd;
An extensive selection of literary and documentary evidence will be examined in both Latin and Greek, with an especial focus on the monastic and ecclesiastical archives of southern Italy.</description>

   <description>Database Management Systems (DBMSs) are an integral part of many applications. Web-based applications, such as e-commerce sites, are faced with highly variable workloads. The number of customers browsing and purchasing items varies throughout the day and business managers can further complicate the workload by requesting complex reports on sales data. This means the load on a database system can fluctuate dramatically with a sudden influx of requests or a request involving a complex query. If there are too many requests operating in the DBMS concurrently, then resources are strained and performance drops. To keep the DBMS’s performance consistent across varying loads, a load control system can be used.&#xd;
This thesis investigates the concept of a load control system based on regulating individual resource usage in a predictive manner. For the purpose of this proof-of- concept study, we focus on a specific resource; namely, the sort heap. A method of estimating sort heap usage based on the query execution plan is presented and several scheduling methods based on these estimations are proposed. A prototype load control system is used to evaluate and compare the scheduling methods. Experiments show that it is possible to both estimate sort heap requirements and to control sort heap usage using our load control system.</description>

   <description>Vascular smooth muscle cell migration is a significant contributor to many aspects of heart disease, and specifically atherosclerosis.  Tissue damage in the arteries can result in the formation of a fatty streak.  Smooth muscle cells (SMC) can then migrate to this site to form a fibrous cap, stabilizing the fatty plaque.  Since cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in developed countries, this function of SMC is an essential area of study.&#xd;
     The formation of lamellipodia and circular dorsal ruffles were studied in this project as indicators that cell migration is occurring.  The roles of the proteins p53, Rac, caldesmon and PTEN were investigated with regards to these actin-based structures.&#xd;
     The tumour suppressor p53 is often reported to cause apoptosis, senescence or cell cycle arrest when stress is placed on a cell, but has recently been shown to regulate cell migration as well.  It was determined in this project that p53 could inhibit the formation of both lamellipodia and circular dorsal ruffles.  It was also shown that this could occur directly through an inhibition of the GTPase Rac.  Previous studies have shown that p53 can upregulate caldesmon, a protein which is known to bind to and stabilize actin filaments while inhibiting Arp2/3-mediated branching.  It was confirmed that p53 could upregulate caldesmon, and that caldesmon could inhibit the formation of lamellipodia and circular dorsal ruffles.  The phosphorylation of caldesmon by p21-associated kinase (PAK) or extracellular signal-related kinase (Erk) was shown to effectively reverse the ability of caldesmon to inhibit these structures.  The role of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) was also studied with regards to this signalling pathway.  PTEN was shown to inhibit lamellipodia and circular dorsal ruffles through its lipid phosphatase activity.&#xd;
     It was concluded that p53 can inhibit the formation of lamellipodia and circular dorsal ruffles in vascular SMC, and that this occurs through Rac, caldesmon and PTEN.</description>

   <description>Rateless codes, also known as fountain codes, are a class of erasure error-control codes that are particularly well suited for broadcast/multicast systems. Raptor codes, as a particularly successful implementation of digital fountain codes, have been used as the application layer forward error correction (FEC) codes in the third generation partnership program (3GPP) Multimedia Broadcast and Multicast Services (MBMS) standard. However, the application of rateless codes to wireless multimedia broadcast/multicast communications has yet to overcome two major challenges: first, wireless multimedia communications usually has stringent delay requirements. In addition, multimedia multicast has to overcome heterogeneity. To meet these challenges, we propose a rateless code design that takes the layered nature of source traffic as well as the varying quality of transmission channels into account. A convex optimization framework for the application of unequal error protection (UEP) rateless codes to synchronous and asynchronous multimedia multicast to heterogeneous users is proposed.&#xd;
&#xd;
    A second thread of the thesis addresses the noisy, bursty and time- varying nature of&#xd;
wireless communication channels that challenge the assumption of erasure channels often used for the wired internet. In order to meet this challenge, the optimal combination of application-layer rateless code and physical layer FEC code rates in time-varying fading channels is investigated. The performance of rateless codes in hybrid error-erasure channels with memory is then studied, and a cross-layer decoding method is proposed to improve decoding performance and complexity.</description>

   <description>Community-based environmental monitoring activities are increasing across Canada. In these activities, organizations undertake the assessment of a specific ecosystem attribute, such as a species or a species assemblage, to improve natural resource management.  Indeed, this process has been widely acknowledged as critical in British Columbia’s salmon enhancement and assessment programs under the direction of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans’ Oceans Habitat Enhancement Branch. Through federal support of these initiatives, many community-based organizations are mobilizing on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. However, this increase in willing organizations does not guarantee that monitoring activities are benefiting the management of salmon stocks.   Often, groups are unable to maintain a stable volunteer base or to collect data that is useable by resource managers. Here I attempt to determine if indicators for successful community-based monitoring can be used to identify if groups are contributing in a positive and effective manner to their local salmon enhancement initiatives. The indicators most critical for organizational success, as identified through a literature review and interviews with active community-based organizations on Vancouver Island, include: volunteer training, community and educational programs, clear goals and roles, and project follow-up, with the most important identified as funding and fundraising, standardization of methods and protocols, and effective communication strategies. Concurrent implementation of these practices can ensure that best practices for salmon enhancement and assessment programs are employed for sustainable natural resource management of salmon.</description>

   <description>Arsenic poisoning due to contaminated groundwater in Bangladesh was first discovered in 1993. Over 90% of the people in Bangladesh rely on groundwater as their major source of drinking water which has caused roughly 33 million people to be exposed to elevated arsenic concentrations. Current efforts by non-government organizations involve the implementation of a variety of arsenic removal technologies to help provide the people of Bangladesh with a clean and safe source of drinking water. As the arsenic contaminated groundwater does not occur in a predictable pattern, one technology cannot be applied as a best fit. Using existing literature, a matrix has been developed that rates existing technologies based on a variety of parameters that are deemed vital both in the operational efficiency and environmental considerations in the implementation of the technology. It is unlikely that one technology will be a satisfactory solution for every case and all will suffer from various limitations. From these limitations, it might be easy to determine which technology can be applied to a given region based on the water chemistry, social issues and technological restrictions. This general method may be used to select technologies that could be implemented to improve the quality of life of millions of people who live in a variety of other localities that also suffer from arsenic contaminated groundwater, such as Argentina and China.</description>

   <description>The compilation of the two chapters of this report ultimately conveys an optimistic message, albeit one threaded with caution.  Chapter 1 expounds the impact of those more common interventions on particulate emissions and concentrations and displays their potential to substantially reduce human exposure to pollutants.  Chapter 2 then examines the literature available on experiences to date with these various interventions and outlines the predominant issues encountered that hindered their overall success.  It herein reveals the deeply intertwined nature of the technological and socio-economic facets of indoor air pollution from cooking and affirms the importance of embracing a holistic approach to addressing the problem by considering not only each issue individually, but also how each affects the others.  The local specificity of programme requirements is made evident, as is in turn the need for initiatives to be “robust to existing limits” encountered upon implementation in varying locations and conditions (Jin et al., 2006).  Moreover, the highlighted importance of participatory programmes echos the WHO’s (2002) call for interventions that strive to “broaden the range of secure and sustainable choices available” which will then “enable people to devise their own solutions”.  As greater numbers of longitudinal studies are carried out that monitor the technical performance of interventions, as well as the socioeconomic and behavioural determinants of their adoption and continued use (Ezzati et al., 2004), more information will be amassed to inform and tailor future programmes as needed.  In the meantime, this report provides a starting point for evaluating intervention appropriateness and demonstrates the significance of this assessment to intervention sustainability.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this study was to determine if, after adjusting for the contribution of exercise dose, exercise intensity was associated with the improvement of insulin sensitivity. Abdominally obese, sedentary men (n = 16, [mean±SD] age: 45.0±7.5 yr; waist circumference: 108.6±5.3 cm) and women (n = 18, [mean±SD] age: 42.3±6.2 yr; waist circumference: 100.1±8.2 cm) performed daily, supervised exercise for 3 and 4 months, respectively. Exercising at a self selected exercise intensity, men were required to expend expended 700 kcal per session and women 500 kcal per session. Exercise intensity and dose were determined using heart rate and oxygen consumption data obtained from repeated graded exercise tests. Insulin sensitivity was determined by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp.  Insulin sensitivity improved in both men and women (change score: men = 7.2±5.4 mg/kgskm/min, women = 5.8±7.1 mg/kgskm/min) (p &lt; 0.05). Exercise intensity was associated with the improvements in insulin sensitivity in men (unstandardized regression coefficient (β) = 0.43, p = 0.02). Adjusting for exercise dose, the change in abdominal adipose tissue (AT), or the change visceral AT did not alter this association (p &lt; 0.05). Exercise intensity was not associated with the improvement of insulin sensitivity in women (β = - 0.11, p = 0.7).  Adjusting for exercise dose, the change in abdominal or visceral AT did not change the association in women (p > 0.05). Our findings suggest that exercise intensity is independently associated with the improvement of insulin sensitivity in abdominally obese men but not women.</description>

   <description>The overall purpose of this study is to describe the ways in which one school contributes to the healthy development of its students by providing an account of external developmental assets from the perspective of students and key staff informants. Specific goals of this study are: (a) to identify the principles and programs as well as the human and ancillary resources at one school whose explicit mission is to embed contexts and courses that contribute positively to the healthy development of young people; and (b) to compare perceptions among stakeholders about the external developmental assets of the school. This study gives voice to students and professionals to describe the extent to which they believe that a school‘s vision, program, and resources can impact the healthy development of young people. Researchers and theorists have encouraged academics to pursue qualitative research as an important step in elucidating the meaning of developmental assets in programs for young people, particularly in schools (Mahoney, Lafferty, &amp; Nutter, 2003; Thurber, Scanlin, Scheuler, &amp; Henderson, 2007; Scales et al., 2000), because, to date, developmental assets research has primarily focused on a quantitative inventory to assess youth resiliency and the efficacy of risk prevention programs. This case study contributes to the growing body of Canadian research on healthy youth development. The perceptions and ideas of participants could add to further understanding about healthy youth development, developmental assets, and the needs of learners in other educational settings.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this thesis is to explore the relationship that love and romance have to young women’s experiences of and decisions to engage in heterosexual intercourse for the first time. Inspired by Sharon Thompson’s (1995) book Going All The Way, I wanted to listen to young women’s stories about love, romance and sex in order to better understand their first sexual experiences. I have interviewed six women based on their age (18-23), on whether their first experiences with sex were both heterosexual and consensual, and on whether their decisions to have ‘sex’ for the first time were influenced by a romantic relationship. I analyse the interview transcripts, contextualizing them within the relevant literature, and explore the ways popular culture and media might have influenced the girls in my study. I am concerned with intercourse because I want to gain a better understanding of young women’s experiences with it and to recognize what love and sex might mean to them. I was surprised to find that, even with third wave feminist ‘empowerment’ discourse and hyper-sexualized media and popular culture, the six women I spoke with felt that sex is about an expression of love and a “deeper connection of intimacy” (Krissy) rather than about empowerment or the fun of ‘doing it’. Even though I required that participants needed to have been influenced by a romantic relationship in their decisions to have intercourse for the first time, it was interesting to see the extent that they valued love in their relationships when love was not part of the criteria required to participate. The findings from this study will be useful to sex educators, including myself, who work with young women as well as to parents who might be able to worry less about their daughters, knowing that some girls are looking for love and commitment when they engage in intercourse, not simply casual sex or hook-ups.</description>

   <description>The problem of measurement system design for stochastic linear systems, a popular modeling strategy for chemical processes, is addressed. A multi-objective optimization approach is used. The design metrics are the capital cost of measurement equipment and a weighted uncertainty in terms of the Kalman filter state estimation error covariance matrix. The Pareto optimal set of measurement systems is identified by any of the following applicable techniques: an exhaustive combinatorial search, sequential sensor addition/removal, and branch-and-bound with semi-definite programs (BnB/SDP) solved at each node. The decision-making process involves the use of simulation experiments as a means to map Pareto optimal measurement systems to a dollar cost of operation. The closed-loop performance of Pareto optimal measurement systems are then simulated under a joint Kalman filter and robust profit-maximizing model predictive control strategy.  &#xd;
&#xd;
The design methodology is applied to two example problems. The first involves a low dimensionality fluid handling network where a number of stream flow rates, a tank level, and a leak stream describe the dynamics. The design variables are the process outputs and the precision with which they are measured. It is observed that the sequential and&#xd;
BnB/SDP techniques are able to approximate the true Pareto optimal set very well, with improved performance in the latter case attainable through trial and error. The second example problem involves a high-dimensionality thermal network model of a one-floor office building. The impact of zero and nonzero state noise covariance structures on the results of the proposed design procedure is investigated. It is shown that measurement importance is placed on the disturbance variables in the deterministic case, whereas importance is placed on the controlled variables when model uncertainty is assumed. Closed-loop simulations incorporating MPC and Kalman filtering are then performed to generate expected operational cost data. The measurement system that minimizes the overall cost of capital investment and operation over the expected lifespan of the measurement is chosen as the final design. It is shown that the combination of measured variables which minimizes the overall cost is those of the three largest bodies of air that are to be controlled.</description>

   <description>Fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) materials have been a material of interest in the field of structural engineering due to their superior mechanical properties such as high strength to weight ratios and resistance to environmental degradation and corrosion. Even though research has established the material to be a viable option for construction they are highly susceptible to elevated temperatures. There are several systems available on the market and a great deal of research needs to be conducted to investigate the change in properties and different behaviour at elevated temperature to serve as a better basis for design. The main objective of this project and the experimental program presented in this thesis is to study the thermo mechanical properties of the available systems on the market.&#xd;
	A summary of the previous research done in the area covering other materials is presented providing an introduction to the behaviour of different systems under elevated temperature. Then, two different experimental programs are presented. The first considers the glass transition temperature and thermal decomposition of the different systems and the second examines the tensile strength of the different systems under different temperature regimes.&#xd;
	The results of both experimental programs are presented and then a connection between the thermo mechanical properties of the resins and the overall strength of the system is established. The research demonstrates that the glass transition temperature of the resin used for an FRP strengthening system is the main determinant of the performance at high temperatures.</description>

   <title>The Role of Neu1 Sialidase in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Activation</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Microbiology &amp; Immunology) -- Queen's University, 2011-06-26 12:04:40.486</description>
   <description>The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exists as a single, highly glycosylated subunit receptor on the plasma membrane of a cell. Upon ligand binding to its extracellular domain, the EGFR dimerizes with an adjacent receptor. This results in activation of the EGFR’s intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, and consequently, autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues on the receptor’s cytoplasmic tail. Adaptor proteins bind to these phosphorylated tyrosine residues and transduce the message internally, initiating a multitude of signalling cascades which stimulate cell growth, division, and movement. Despite all that has been elucidated regarding the activation and signalling pathways of the EGFR, the parameters controlling dimerization and activation remain unknown.&#xd;
 	Recently, Neu1 sialidase, an enzyme which cleaves α-2,3-linked sialic acids from glycosylated substrates, has been implicated as a critical mediator of TrkA receptor activation. Upon activation, the sialidase desialylates the external receptor glycosylation, removing a physical barrier which was formerly hindering receptor dimerization, and thus, receptor activation. Based on the known sialylation of EGFR glycosylation, as well as the demonstrated importance of receptor glycosylation in EGFR activation, we hypothesized that the EGFR may be activated by a similar mechanism. &#xd;
 	Here, we report an identical membrane signalling paradigm initiated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding to EGFR to rapidly induce Neu1 sialidase activity in live NIH3T3-EGFR cells but not in live Neu1-deficient human fibroblast cells. Furthermore, we report that Neu1 sialidase activity is required for EGFR activation, supported by the finding that tyrosine phosphorylation is inhibited in EGF-stimulated NIH3T3-hEGFR cells which have been pretreated with both broad-range (oseltamivir phosphate) and specific (anti-Neu1 neutralizing antibody) sialidase inhibitors. MMP-9 plays a role in the initiation of Neu1 sialidase post-ligand binding, as pre-treatment of NIH3T3-hEGFR cells with specific MMP-9 inhibitor prior to EGF stimulation blocks membrane sialidase activity as well as tyrosine phosphorylation. Of critical importance to this schematic is the finding that both Neu1 and MMP-9 co-immunoprecipitate with EGFR on the plasma membrane of both naïve and EGF-stimulated NIH3T3-hEGFR cells.  Together, these findings reveal a novel EGFR activation mechanism in which cross-talk between Neu1 and MMP-9 plays a vital role in EGF-induced receptor activation.</description>

   <description>Dephosphorylation of the Cdc2 kinase by the Cdc25 tyrosine phosphatase is the universally conserved trigger for mitotic entry.  Cdc25 is also the point of convergence for checkpoint signaling pathways which monitor the genome for damaged DNA and incomplete replication.  In addition, Cdc25 is inhibited by a MAP kinase cascade in the event of osmotic, oxidative and/or heat stress.  These pathways inhibit cell cycle progression by phosphorylating Cdc25 resulting in its association with 14-3-3 and nuclear export.  Although Cdc25 can be observed leaving the nucleus following inhibitory signals it is controversial whether phosphorylation, 14-3-3 binding or export itself is required for checkpoint proficiency. In fission yeast, Cdc25 is phosphorylated in vitro on 12 serine and threonine residues by the effector kinase of the DNA replication checkpoint, Cds1.  Nine of these residues reside in the N-terminal regulatory region, while three are found in the extreme C-terminus of the protein.  We show here that phosphorylation the nine N-terminal residues, nor any of the 12 in vitro sites, are required for enforcement of the DNA replication checkpoint.  In lieu of Cdc25 phosphorylation the phosphatase is rapidly degraded and mitotic entry prevented by the action of the Mik1 kinase, targeting Cdc2.  Thus, multiple mechanisms exist for preventing mitotic entry when S-phase progression is inhibited.  The three C-terminal in vitro phosphorylation sites have not previously been examined in fission yeast.  However, homology exists between the S. pombe protein and the Cdc25 orthologues in humans, Xenopus and Drosophila in this region.  We report here that in S. pombe these sites are required to prevent mitotic entry following replication arrest in the absence of Mik1, and in the maintenance, but not establishment, of arrest following DNA damage.  Our previous work showed that Cdc25 nuclear import requires the Sal3 importin-β but at the time we were unable to show a direct interaction between these two proteins.  The final chapter of this thesis proves physical interaction by co-immunoprecipitation.  Cdc25 mutants lacking all twelve putative Cds1 sites show nuclear localization during mitosis in a sal3- background, effectively reversing the cell cycle regulated pattern of accumulation of the phosphatase.</description>

   <description>Support groups are an effective source of support in a number of populations (e.g., Beaudoin &amp; Tao, 2007; Preyde &amp; Ardal, 2003; Singer, et al., 1999). Parents of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a particularly stressed group who can benefit from support (Blacher &amp; McIntyre, 2006). These studies investigated: 1) predictors of participation in support groups for parents of children with ASD and 2) the effects of participation in an online support group for these parents. &#xd;
One hundred seventy-eight parents completed a series of online questionnaires measuring their beliefs about support groups and ASD, coping style, social support, mood, parenting stress, and their child’s autistic symptoms and daily functioning. Parents who were currently using parent support groups (PSGs) reported using more adaptive coping strategies than both parents who had never used PSGs and parents who had used PSGs in the past. Parents who had used PSGs in the past reported that they did not find the groups as beneficial as parents who were currently using them, and parents who had never participated in PSGs reported several issues with accessibility that made it difficult to participate in PSGs.&#xd;
A smaller group of parents (n = 36), who had participated in the first study, participated in an online support group designed for this study. An additional group of parents (n = 25), who had also completed the first study, served as a no-treatment control group. The parents in these two groups completed a subset of the questionnaires used in the first study following the 4-month support group, so that changes in mood, anxiety, parenting stress, and positive perceptions could be documented over time. No significant differences between the groups and across time were found. However, parents who participated in the group reported being satisfied with the support they received and finding the group helpful. &#xd;
Overall, the results of these studies suggest that interventions for parents of children with ASD need to be individualized and focused on the needs of the parents. Further research is required to investigate the efficacy of online support groups for parents of children with ASD.</description>

   <description>Elevated plasma concentrations of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) are a risk factor for a variety of atherosclerotic disorders including coronary heart disease. In the current study, the investigators report that incubation of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with high concentrations of apolipoprotein(a)(apo(a)/Lp(a)) induces apoptosis and endothelial dysfunction in a dose dependent manner. Apo(a), the component of Lp(a) mediates these effects by inducing externalization of Annexin V, DNA condensation and fragmentation which are the hallmarks of death by apoptosis. The pathway of apo(a)-induced apoptosis is associated with overexpression of Bax, caspase-9, p53 phosphorylation, decreased in Bcl-2 expression and activation of caspase-3. Taken together, the data suggest that elevated concentration of apo(a) induces apoptosis in endothelial cells probably by activating the intrinsic pathway. The data also showed that apo(a) induces increased expression of the growth arrest protein (Gas1), which has been known to induce apoptosis and growth arrest in vitro. In addition the data showed that elevated apo(a)/Lp(a) attenuates endothelial nitric oxide (eNOS) activity and endothelin-1 (ET-1) in a dose and time-dependent manner, particularly with small apo(a) isoforms. In summary, the authors proposed a new signaling pathway by which apo(a)/Lp(a) induce apoptosis and this finding could help explain how apo(a)/Lp(a) mediate atherosclerosis related diseases.</description>

   <description>IL-17 promotes inflammation through the recruitment of monocytes and induction of various chemokines and inflammatory cytokines.  Monocytes respond to IL-17 through the heteromeric IL-17 receptor (IL-17R) composed of subunits IL-17RA and IL-17RC.  Together, monocytes and IL-17 amplify inflammation.  Controlling the cellular response to IL-17 is crucial to prevent hyperactivation of inflammatory responses, which could lead to chronic inflammatory diseases.  The cellular response to increased IL-17 levels may be limited by controlling the receptor levels.  Before we understand how monocytes respond to IL-17 during infection, we must first characterize the expression of IL-17R in these cells in response to LPS, a well-characterized pro-inflammatory signal.  The aim of this study is to understand the mechanisms which regulate IL-17R levels in human monocytes.  IL-17R mRNA and protein levels were measured in response to LPS by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis in primary human monocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and the human monocytic cell line, THP-1.  LPS enhanced IL-17RA and RC transcript levels in monocytes and PBMC.  In contrast, IL-17RA protein levels decreased with LPS treatment in these cells.  Investigation into mechanisms regulating IL-17RA protein levels lead to the observation that IL-17RA undergoes receptor degradation in response to LPS.  This work identifies for the first time that 1) LPS enhances transcript levels of IL-17R and 2) after LPS treatment, IL-17RA protein levels are reduced via an endosome-dependent degradation pathway.</description>

   <description>The focus of this thesis was to design a scaffold for in vitro culture that would mimic the structure of the native ligament in order to influence primary ligament cells towards the production of ligament-specific tissue. A major part of this project was material selection and subsequent testing to determine if the chosen materials were suitable for the scaffold design. A 20:80 (CL:DLLA) poly(ε-caprolactone-co-D,L-lactide) copolymer (PCLDLLA) was synthesized and electrospun with sub-cellular fibre diameters. The fibres were manufactured into aligned arrays to mimic the collagen fibrils of the ligament. To enhance cell and protein adhesion properties, the PCLDLLA polymer surface was modified using a base catalyzed etching technique. A photocrosslinked&#xd;
methacrylated glycol chitosan (M-GC) hydrogel was used to deliver encapsulated&#xd;
ligament cells to the biomimetic scaffold and mimic the hydrated proteoglycan matrix&#xd;
portion of the ligament. The scaffolds were cultured in vitro for a 4 week period and&#xd;
characterized using immunohistochemistry to identify and localize ligament specific&#xd;
proteins produced within the scaffolds. Cell culture results indicated that the M-GC&#xd;
hydrogel was an effective method of delivering viable cells evenly throughout the&#xd;
biomimetic scaffold. Compared to the unmodified PCLDLLA surfaces, the base-etched&#xd;
electrospun PCLDLLA fibre surfaces increased cell adhesion and acted as new tissue&#xd;
growth guides in the biomimetic scaffold. The biomimetic scaffolds produced and&#xd;
accumulated ligament specific proteins: collagens type I and III. The biomimetic scaffold design was determined to be a viable alternative to the current designs of ligament tissue engineering scaffolds.</description>

   <description>This thesis analyzes the major theme of ‘postcolonial genealogy’ in portraying the African bending under the weight of colonial history in Le vieux nègre et la médaille, Une vie de boy of Ferdinand Oyono and Le Chercheur d’Afriques of Henri Lopes. Being a product of a colonial Genesis, the African character runs behind the colonizer’s mirror through his Civilizing Mission. René Girard’s ‘double bind’ theory explains how this cultural assimilation is, in Le vieux nègre et la médaille and Une vie de boy, a dead end because the colonizer needs a subordinate and not an equal. The cohabitation of a black housewife with the French Commander in Le Chercheur d’Afriques should be seen as simply an allegory of postcolonial Africa’s dependency on the West. The consequences of the feminization of the African continent are enormous in the post-colonial imaginary. While the colonizer had conquered Africa with his Herculean body, in Oyono’s novels, his Fall is obtained through the aesthetics of Bakhtinian ‘rabaissement’ which degrades his ‘grotesque body’ to that of the colonized. The colonizer and the colonized are neutralized and leveled in their perishable bodies, thus, making futile the Civilizing Mission that operated by ranking races. Power is never total. It is always imperfect, and can never destroy a subjectivity that resists it. In Oyono’s novels, the Fall of the colonial Father is also obtained through the inquisitive gaze that the colonized return back to the colonizer, and through their ‘subversive mimicry’ that parodies his codes. In Une vie de boy and Le Chercheur d’Afriques, the ‘son-Father’ relationship between the hero and the colonial Father, is also symbolic of the ‘Africa-West’ rapports. Living under the specter of the Father, the son has to negotiate his survival between weaning and parricide. The biological miscegenation in Le Chercheur d’Afriques is a metaphor of the ‘rhizome identity’ of the postcolonial African who renounces both the Fathers of Negritude and those of the Civilizing Mission.</description>

   <description>An analytical model is presented for the analysis of pulse interference tests conducted in a fractured porous medium with connection to a free surface boundary at the water table. The solution is applicable to open borehole pulse interference tests due to the accommodation of multiple horizontal fractures intersecting each wellbore and a connection from the uppermost horizontal fracture to a free surface boundary. The solution is derived using the Laplace transform method and evaluation of the solution is performed by numerical inversion using the Talbot algorithm. Based on an informal sensitivity analysis, unique values for transmissivity, storativity, specific storage, vertical hydraulic conductivity and specific yield are predicted over a range of realistic values for these parameters. &#xd;
&#xd;
The analytical model is used to analyze slug tests and pulse interference tests conducted in a fractured gneiss formation. The results of these tests are compared to long-term pumping tests to identify the effect of measurement scale on transmissivity, storativity, vertical hydraulic conductivity and specific yield obtained in a fractured rock setting. Scale artefacts relating to measurement or analysis methods are minimized through the use of consistent well configurations in each of the applied hydraulic testing methods. &#xd;
&#xd;
The geometric mean estimates of transmissivity and storativity are shown to vary by less than an order of magnitude from local-scale tests to long-term pumping tests. The geometric mean specific yield result from a series of pulse interference tests that samples both highly fractured and poorly fractured portions of the rock formation approximates the long-term pumping test estimate of specific yield.&#xd;
&#xd;
The geometric mean result for vertical hydraulic conductivity decreases by approximately 1.5 orders of magnitude from the slug test to pumping test scale; however, pulse interference tests conducted on highly fractured portions of the formation produce vertical hydraulic conductivity estimates that are within a half order of magnitude of the long-term pumping test results. This suggests that the performance of pulse interference tests on a highly fractured portion of a rock formation may be a less time-intensive alternative to large-scale pumping tests in the determination of vertical hydraulic conductivity.</description>

   <description>Elevated arsenic (As) concentrations in surface water from storing mine tailings in lakes can have a negative impact on local and downstream vegetation and aquatic life. At Terra Mine, an abandoned silver and copper mine in the Northwest Territories, tailings storage in Ho-Hum Lake has resulted in dissolved As concentrations of 50-80 μg/L, exceeding the 5 μg/L maximum guideline for aquatic life. A natural wetland located downstream appears to be attenuating As from surface water. The objectives of this study was to understand the sources of As to the wetland, the effectiveness of the wetland to sequester As, the form and stability of As in the sediments, the processes controlling As mobility, and the effect of seasonal changes in the wetland in the dissolved phase. Arsenic bound to the sediments was determined by analyzing for bulk composition, and As speciation and element association were identified using synchrotron-based bulk XANES and ESEM analysis.&#xd;
&#xd;
Arsenic enters the wetland by surface flow from Ho-Hum Lake, subsurface flow through the waste rock airstrip, and by windblown dust. In spring, dissolved As concentrations in surface water increased downstream. In late summer, a decrease in concentration was observed in the upstream portion of the wetland, however As returned to lake concentrations further downstream. Sediment As concentrations increased over the summer. ESEM and bulk XANES indicate that As was associated with (oxy)hydroxides and secondary sulphides. In the spring, when water levels were high from snow melt, (oxy)hydroxides formed and captured As, while sulphide oxidation in the sediments lead to the release of As into surface water. Over the summer, the onset of reducing conditions from microbial activity drove the formation of As-bearing sulphides and dissolution of (oxy)hydroxides.&#xd;
&#xd;
While As was accumulating in the sediments at most sites in the wetland over the summer, these results suggest that the wetland was not effectively sequestering dissolved As from the surface water, and that sediment-water cycling of As in the wetland as a result of seasonal redox variations were contributing As in the surface water.</description>

   <description>Recently, a chronic idiopathic disease of the esophagus has emerged, which is now known as eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE).  Incomplete knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of EoE has limited treatment options.  EoE is known to be a Th2-type immune-mediated disorder.  Based on previous studies in both patients and experimental models, it is possible that an abnormal reaction to antigen mediates the pathophysiology of EoE.  In this thesis, symptoms and signs unique to EoE were identified by an age-matched, case-controlled study of 326 patients with EoE and gastroesophageal reflux disease.  The molecular mechanisms involved in antigen detection in the esophagus, in relation to EoE were then investigated.  Esophageal epithelial cells were found, for the first time, to be capable of acting as non-professional antigen presenting cells, with the ability to engulf, process and present antigen on MHC class II to T helper lymphocytes.  Antigen presentation by esophageal epithelial cells was induced by interferon-γ, which is increased in biopsies from patients with EoE.  Next, it was discovered that esophageal epithelial cell lines expressed functional toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR3, but in esophageal mucosal biopsies only infiltrating immune cells (including eosinophils) expressed TLR2 and TLR3.  Finally, the potential involvement of IgE in the pathogenesis of esophageal inflammation was investigated.  IgE in the esophagus was found to be present on mast cells, which are increased in density in the esophageal mucosae of patients with EoE and especially those with a history of atopy.  Mechanisms of antigen detection may mediate the pathophysiology of EoE in the esophagus through antigen presentation by epithelial cells, detection by TLRs on immune cells and detection through IgE on mucosal mast cells.  Together, these findings demonstrate that mechanisms of antigen detection may actually contribute to the pathophysiology of EoE.  Through increased understanding of the mechanisms of EoE, the results of this thesis may contribute to future therapy.</description>

   <description>North American Holocaust narratives have undergone a number of temporal phases in collective representation, shifting from an initial widespread silence, to the current state of mass Americanization.  The processes of how the Holocaust is recast, retold and socially reconstructed over time are examined in this essay.  While many disciplines have attempted to study the Holocaust from a variety of theoretical perspectives, this essay is located at the intersection of two divergent areas of study.  The combined studies of collective memory and victimology are applied to contemporary Holocaust narratives, in order to show how certain narratives gain primacy over others.  Also illustrated is the manner in which particular groups lay claim to these narratives.  Finally, conclusions relating to the purposes served by the domination of Holocaust narratives within the North American cultural context are highlighted, and future work is described.</description>

   <description>Natural convective heat transfer from flat plates and short cylinders inclined at an angle to the vertical in laminar and transition flow regions with isothermal or constant heat flux conditions have been numerically and experimentally studied. When the width of the plate is relatively small compared to its height, i.e., the plate is narrow, the heat transfer rate can be considerably greater than that predicted by these two-dimensional flow results. When the narrow plate is inclined to the vertical, pressure changes normal to the plate surface arise and these pressure changes can alter the nature and the magnitude of the edge effects. When two narrow inclined rectangular flat plates of the same size separated vertically or horizontally, the flow interaction between these heated plates can have a significant effect on the heat transfer.&#xd;
	 When relatively small square and circular cylinders with exposed top surfaces inclined to the vertical are used, the interaction of the flow over the surfaces that make up the cylinder and inclination angle have, in general, a considerable effect on the magnitude of the mean heat transfer rate and on the nature of the flow over the cylinder surfaces.&#xd;
	In the present numerical studies it has been assumed that the fluid properties are constant except for the density change with temperature which gives rise to the buoyancy forces, this having been treated using the Boussinesq approach. The numerical solution was obtained by numerically solving the full three-dimensional form of the governing equations, these equations being written in dimensionless form. The solution was obtained using a commercial CFD code, FLUENT. Results were only obtained for a Prandtl number of 0.7; this being approximately the value of air. &#xd;
&#xd;
	In the experimental studies, the average heat transfer rates from cylinders were determined by the transient method, which involves heating the model and then measuring its temperature-time variation while it cools. The average heat transfer rates from the flat plates were determined using a steady state method, which basically involved electrically heating the plate.  The tests were carried out inside a large enclosure.</description>

   <description>This study presents a cultural heritage landscape assessment of the Hickson Trail.  A former railway corridor and associated commercial/industrial node in the Village of Hickson, Ontario have been identified by the author of this study as a potential cultural heritage landscape requiring a systematic evaluation to determine heritage value and whether conservation measures are warranted.  As a result, the research questions posed in this study are the following:  1. Is the Hickson Trail (the former Port Dover and Lake Huron Railway) a cultural heritage landscape as defined by the Ontario Provincial Policy Statement?; and, 2. Does the Hickson Trail (the former Port Dover and Lake Huron Railway) merit protection under the Ontario Heritage Act?  These questions are posed to provide a cultural heritage landscape evaluation in the context of Ontario’s heritage planning policy regime.  The elements of ‘railscape’ are presented by the author to guide both historical research and a landscape survey.  A methodology adapted from the United States National Parks Service is utilized as a framework to evaluate the historical significance, integrity and boundaries of the potential cultural heritage landscape.  Overall, the study’s findings are that Hickson Trail is historically significant; however, the landscape lacks sufficient integrity to designate under the Ontario Heritage Act.</description>

   <description>Assistive technology, specifically, word prediction software holds great promise in supporting the writing process for students with learning disabilities. This thesis reports on a qualitative study that examined eight students’ self-perceptions as learners and writers using word prediction software. &#xd;
Participants were purposefully recruited from a local Learning Disabilities Association’s listserv located in a mid-sized Eastern Ontario city.  Three groups of two to three Grades 4-8 students previously identified with a learning disability, and who were already using word prediction software (e.g. Co-Writer or WordQ), attended a 3-hour session. This session included an instructional workshop, and completion of a short reflective writing task followed by a focus group. Separately, participants’ parents attended a focus group. Data for this study includes focus group responses (student and parent), observations from the workshop, and the written student reflections. Using content analysis, emerging themes from participant responses were analyzed. The main themes from this analysis were: (1) students’ perceptions of having an equal opportunity to participate in academic subjects; (2) increased student self-efficacy; and (3) an ad hoc approach to training and the use of assistive technology software in school. These themes were then linked to relevant literature and a set of recommendations was developed for educators. Recommendations for the future included facilitating increased self-efficacy for students with learning disabilities; reducing the ad hoc approach to teacher education by instituting mandatory courses about students with disabilities in teacher education programs; and increased instruction in the use of assistive technology for parents and teachers.</description>

   <description>Cells of the cardiovascular system translate incoming extracellular signals from hormones and drugs through binding of cell surface receptors, and activation of intracellular signaling cascades allowing modulation of specific cellular function. cAMP and cGMP are ubiquitous second messengers that activate specific signaling machinery used to promote or inhibit cellular functions such as cell migration, cell adhesion and proliferation. Increases in intracellular cAMP or cGMP levels occurs through activation of adenylyl cyclase (cAMP) or guanylyl cyclase (cGMP) or by inhibition of the cAMP and cGMP hydrolyzing enzymes, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Cyclic nucleotides achieve signaling specificity through compartmentation, a mechanism allowing effective regulation of cAMP or cGMP signaling in discrete parts of the cell in a spatial and temporal manner. Cells of the cardiovascular system such as platelets, vascular endothelial cells (VECs), vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) maintain cyclic nucleotide compartmentation through coordinating signaling complexes containing a cAMP or cGMP effector protein and PDEs. Studies reported in this thesis demonstrate that human platelets, VECs and VSMCs each contain distinct cyclic nucleotide signaling complexes, and that based on their composition and selective subcellular localization, regulate specific cellular functions. In platelets, subcellular localization of PDE5 results in differential regulation of PDE5 and selective regulation of Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum stores, an initial step in platelet aggregation and provides a potential therapeutic target in preventing thrombosis. VECs utilize multiple signaling systems to regulate cellular function including cAMP signaling pathways and modification of phosphatidylinositols. These studies demonstrate that a PDE3B-based signaling complex allows integration of both cAMP and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-γ (PI3Kγ) signals resulting in increased cell adhesion and cell spreading. Finally, studies in VSMCs demonstrate that PDE5 localization in cells allows cAMP/cGMP cross talk through PDE5 and PDE3A. These results are discussed in the context of further understanding the role of PDEs in mediating cAMP and cGMP signaling and modulation of cell function in cells of the cardiovascular system.</description>

   <description>Part one of this thesis will discuss research which involves the direct comparison of the activity of commonly used precatalysts with the newly synthesized precatalyst, Pd(η5-C5H5)(η3-1-Ph-C3H4), for Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions. Sonogashira reactions are important as they provide a simple method for the formation of substituted alkynes, a commonly found functionality within important organic molecules. These reactions are generally believed to be catalyzed by a Pd(0)L2 species which are generated in situ from a palladium precatalyst and are often co-catalyzed by CuI although use of the latter is undesirable as it induces homocoupling in certain instances. The rate and quantity of active species generated is not known for the commonly used precatalysts and is a potential reason for decreased rates and yields. Norton et al. have recently demonstrated that the newly synthesized, easily handled compound Pd(η5-C5H5)(η3-1-Ph-C3H4) is a superior precatalyst as it generates the active Pd(0)L2 species more quickly than other commonly used palladium precatalysts. Part one of this thesis will discuss research which investigated the efficiencies of precatalysts used for Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions. &#xd;
Part two of this thesis will discuss research into the syntheses of a novel series of ruthenium complexes and their utilization as ester hydrogenation catalysts. Reduction of esters to the corresponding alcohols is normally carried out using LiAlH4, a stoichiometric type of reaction which produces large amounts of undesirable by-products. Ruthenium-based catalysts are known to hydrogenate a variety of functional groups and many catalytic systems have been developed for the hydrogenation of alkenes, ketones, etc. The recent literature also describes a small number of ruthenium catalyst systems which enable ester hydrogenation to the same types of alcohols produced by LiAlH4 reduction albeit catalytically, a much “greener” type of chemistry. This paper will discuss the syntheses of a series of Ru(acac)2(phosphine)1-2 complexes and their utilization as ester hydrogenation catalysts.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this study was to analyze the coach-athlete interactions occurring in a successful sport program for athletes with disabilities and their able-bodied siblings.  The successful nature of this program was established by its athletes’ competitive achievements and by the athletes’ reports of positive experiences within this sport environment.  This study utilized state space grid and observational methodology and was the second application of this methodology in field-based sport psychology research (Erickson, Côté, Hollenstein, &amp; Deakin, in press).  The head coach of the program and twenty-four athletes were observed over multiple practice sessions.  Both coach and athlete behaviour was coded continuously for the duration of each practice session. Measures of coach-athlete interaction structure, based on dynamic systems concepts, were derived from these coded behaviours.  These measures were examined for the team as a whole and compared between groups within the team (competitive vs. recreational athletes and athletes with disabilities vs. able-bodied athletes).  Results indicated that the coach-athlete interactions of the team were highly patterned. Within this consistent pattern, the coach spent most of her time silently observing the athletes.  Other commonly exhibited behaviours included individualized technical instruction, organization, and positive feedback.  With regards to behavioural sequencing, the coach’s time spent observing the athletes was often interspersed with periods of organization, instruction, and feedback.  The coach appeared to adapt her coaching style according to the competitive levels of the athletes, but no differences emerged when comparing the coach-athlete interactions between athletes with disabilities and able-bodied athletes.  Overall, this successful sport environment was characterized by positive coach-athlete interactions that were deliberately patterned and mutually respectful.</description>

   <description>The 5Cs (competence, confidence, connection, character and caring/compassion) have been proposed as important constructs that describe the presence of positive youth development (PYD; Lerner et al., 2005).  While the 5Cs are intuitively appealing, a recent study failed to provide support for the framework of the 5Cs within a sample of youth sport participants (Jones, Dunn, Holt, Sullivan, &amp; Bloom, in press).  Rather than abandoning the framework of the Cs in the youth sport setting, this finding highlights the importance of developing a sport-specific framework.  In applying the 5Cs to sport, Côté, Bruner, Erickson, Strachan, and Fraser-Thomas (2010) found that competence, confidence, and connection were well represented in the sport literature, but that caring/compassion were embedded within the character literature.  As a result, they collapsed the 5Cs into a 4Cs framework, which has been used in the current study.  The purpose of the current study was to garner an understanding of what each of the 4Cs mean to a group of youth sport participants in the sport context.  To this end, 10 single-sex focus groups were conducted with 49 youth sport participants (24 boys, 25 girls), 9 to 13 years old (M=10.8 years).  The participants were involved in a variety of sports, with soccer, hockey, baseball/softball, and lacrosse being the most common.  Data analyses revealed the types of information that participants use to form their perceptions of the 4Cs, along with the sources from which this information is obtained.  Participants indicated that they used information from coaches, parents, peers, self-perceptions, and the sport context in creating their understanding of the 4Cs.  Participants referred to obtaining information from peers regarding all 4Cs.  Conversely, coaches were referenced regarding competence, confidence, and connection, but not character. Parents were not referenced by the participants in their understanding of connection or character in the sport setting.  Notable findings also include the strong emphasis participants placed on their level of effort in determining their competence and confidence. Overall, results highlight the importance of providing young athletes opportunities to experience success and interact with peers in a fun and inclusive sport environment.</description>

   <description>Researchers have long noted that repeated expression of a judgment can cause that judgment to become more extreme. Three perspectives were explored for why this effect occurs. The first perspective implied that repeated expression results in changes in the evaluation such that it becomes more extreme. The next implied that individuals misinterpret ambiguous response scales and respond based on confidence which results in extremity. The final perspective implied that participants understand response scales but are sometimes incapable of accomplishing the judgment, and invoke confidence as a heuristic to guide responding. Experiment One tested these ideas in a colour judgment paradigm in a 3 (Level of Frequency: 3 vs. 5 vs. 8) x 2 (Question Order: Paired Judgments vs. Separated Judgments) mixed-model design. Repeated expression resulted in greater extremity, and greater confidence in judgments. Confidence was found to mediate the relationship between repeated expression and increased extremity regardless of question order. Experiment Two further disentangled the relationship between repeated expression and extremity by directly manipulating task difficulty, and by manipulating the nature of the response scale labels. A 3 (Level of frequency: 3 vs. 5 vs. 8) x 2 (Type of scale: numerical rating scale vs. colour shade scale) x 2 (Task Difficulty: 144 judgments versus 80 judgments) mixed-design experiment was conducted. Repeated expression again led to increased confidence in judgments. Results showed that repeated expression led to increased extremity when participants responded to the numeric rating scale that was considered ambiguous, but not when using the less ambiguous colour shade scale. Confidence fully mediated the effect of repeated expression on extremity in the numeric rating scale condition. In the colour shade scale condition, the mediation of confidence was offset by a direct negative effect of frequency on extremity. Overall, evidence was found for both the response mapping ambiguity perspective and the evaluative change perspective. Evidence did not support the ability perspective.</description>

   <description>Athletes are embedded within an environment that can be conceptualized as comprising multiple nested hierarchal levels that span increasingly larger contexts—the most salient being the individual level, the club level, and the community level. Viewing the field of sport psychology broadly, it is apparent that the majority of research has been conducted at lower levels, such as athletes’ developmental trajectories (Côté, Baker, &amp; Abernethy, 2003) and peer interactions (Smith, 2003). While sport scientists have begun to study higher levels such as successful sport programs (Martindale, Collins, &amp; Abraham, 2007; Vallee &amp; Bloom, 2005) and successful clubs (Henriksen, Stambulova, &amp; Roessler, 2010a, 2010b) there is a lack of research at the community level. The purpose of this project was to conduct an integrated case study to systematically gather rich information via diverse sources to effectively understand how one successful sporting community develops athletic talent. Lockeport, Nova Scotia—a relatively small, rural, maritime community with a population of approximately 650 residents—was chosen based on athletic success. Twenty-two community residents, including athletes, parents, coaches, a grandparent, the recreation coordinator, and the mayor, were interviewed with the aim to understand how community level factors may have influenced athletic development within a recent ten year span (2000-2009). Interviews were qualitatively analyzed using the method of content analysis (Côté, Salmela, Baria, &amp; Russell, 1993). Results supported existing athlete development research and highlighted underexplored areas. Specifically, results fell into one of three themes: (1) athletes’ developmental experiences, (2) the community influences that caused or enabled these developmental experiences, (3) and socio-cultural influences expressed by participants. Regarding developmental experiences, athletes in Lockeport engaged in large amounts of unorganized youth-led sport activities comprised of mixed-age athletes. Athletes also participated in various different organized sports, whose members remained stable throughout development. Regarding community influences, coaches created community sporting events, celebrations, and learning opportunities for youth. This was facilitated by the integration of the local high school and community. Regarding socio-cultural influences, participants expressed a sense of community and shared a collective identity, which may have facilitated the presence of role modeling and pro-community behavior apparent in Lockeport.</description>

values determined based on radio-labelling affinity assays for hCysLT2R. Activity of a&#xd;
synthetic analogue of LTC4, N-Methyl LTC4 (NMLTC4), gave an EC50 value of 8.5 nM.&#xd;
Also described in this thesis, is the synthesis of a cysLT2R selective antagonist, 3-{[(3-&#xd;

showed a dose-dependent inhibition (IC50 value of 86 nM) when CysLT2R was&#xd;
stimulated with 30 nM of LTD4. Both the selective agonist (NMLTC4) as well as the&#xd;
selective cysLT2R antagonist were also tested in vivo in a localized vascular ear&#xd;

stimulation of cysLT2R, and this extravasation can be significantly attenuated by the cysLT2R antagonist.</description>

   <description>The Eph receptor tyrosine kinases are a highly conserved family of proteins involved in a variety  of developmental processes. As well, the Eph receptors appear to play a pivotal role in the development and progression of some cancers. The nematode C. elegans has emerged as a strong developmental model, for the study of human Eph receptors.  Recent research in this model, has suggested an antagonistic relationship between VAB-1, the single C. elegans Eph receptor and DAF-18, the homolog of the human tumor suppressor PTEN. This work in C. elegans has led to the hypothesis that the human Eph receptors and PTEN may function in a similar way.  To provide evidence to support this hypothesis I showed that human EPHA2 and PTEN could physically interact in vitro. Furthermore, my research shows that the human Eph receptors appear to function like the C. elegans Eph receptor (VAB-1) in the neurons of the worm.  Finally, I provided evidence to show that EphA3 K761N, a common mutation found in human lung cancers, behaves like a gain-of-function mutation in C. elegans.  Expressing EphA3 K761N or the analogous mutation in VAB-1, K859N, results in overactive receptor tyrosine kinase activity leading to abnormal axon guidance in C. elegans. These results have furthered our understanding of the evolutionary conservation between the human Eph receptors and VAB-1, and show the promise of using this model to discover novel components of the human Eph receptor signaling pathway.</description>

   <description>In recent years the G8 and G20 Summits have become important sites of protest and conflict.  Extensive planning by  police and protesters have transformed the public meaning of these yearly assemblies into  large-scale events characterized by what many see as threats to public order. The summits have also provided a world-stage for the economically and racially disadvantaged as well as globalized free trade dissenters to voice their resistance and opposition. At the same time, police have been placed on the opposite side of the conflict, ordered to “control the masses.” This conflict situation can sometimes lead to collective violence, especially on behalf of the police. In attempting to explain the police collective violence witnessed at the G8/G20 protests in Toronto in June of 2010, Neil Smelser’s (1962) value-added model of collective behaviour can be employed.  This model demonstrates how processes involving structural conduciveness, structural strain, the spread of a generalized belief, the mobilization of participants and finally the utilization of social control can lead to an event such as collective violence. Recent revisions to the value-added argument by Fine (1997) have shifted attention away from the functionalist assumptions of the model and toward a more social constructionist stance.  Thus, for Fine, belief itself does not create action. Rather, the use of the belief by claimsmakers can lead to a call to action, through media or other outlets. Finally, Randall Collins’s (2008) theory of forward panic is useful for illustrating the finer details of precisely how police mobilize for violence. In order to analyze the police collective violence witnessed over the weekend, a combination of participant observation, semi-structured interviews and ethnographic content analysis methods were employed. The findings support that because of the placement of the G8/G20 meetings, the conflicting relationship between the police and the protesters and the construction of the protesters as troublemakers, meant to be approached with suspicion, the police were able to overcome the tense conflict situation and attack the protesters. I conclude by suggesting a community-policing model for future protest situations.</description>

   <description>From its inception, Canada's 'Indian policy' has sought to undermine the bond between indigenous children and their communities. Each era has seen a new reason and corresponding tactic to remove indigenous children. They have been institutionalized in residential schools, placed in foster homes, provincial 'care' facilities, and adopted by Euro-Canadian families. While it is widely accepted that the forceful removal of indigenous children during the residential school era and the "Sixties Scoop" was a colonial strategy, contemporary child welfare practices seem to escape the same scrutiny. This seems to be the case even though indigenous children continue to be removed en masse and are vastly overrepresented in the Canadian child welfare system. Indeed, there are more indigenous children in 'care' today than ever before in Canadian history, including the residential school era and following the "Sixties Scoop". Given these trends the colonial effect of contemporary child welfare practices seems evident. &#xd;
This project thus seeks to problematize child welfare practices in relation to indigenous peoples. In particular, it is the aim of this thesis to shed light on some of the narratives that underlie these practices. Through a critical discourse analysis this thesis illuminates how news media in Alberta and Manitoba disseminate controlling images of indigenous peoples and their children. I argue that the discourses in both provinces normalize the removal of indigenous children while naturalizing colonial control.</description>

   <description>Nanoplasmonics has opened up the gates for numerous innovations. Recent studies showed that metal nanoparticles, when introduced into the solar cells and organic light emitting diodes, would greatly enhance their efficiencies. Though these advances are promising, they require a tool for investigating the interactions occuring at the microscopic level to further optimize their performance. In that context, we are interested in understanding the energy transfer mechanism between molecules in the vicinity of metal nanoparticle. Time-resolved fluorescence intensity and anisotropy experiments on single and clusters of Silver-Silica core-shell nanoparticles coated with Rhodamine B(RB) dye molecules, (Ag-SiO2-RB) were performed. We witnessed the signature of the interaction between RB molecules and metal nanoclusters in the form of the enhanced fluorescence intensity decay rates. The fluorescence lifetime of RB in the vicinity of the nanoparticles was (600 +/- 100) ps, as compared to (2.4+/-0.3)ns in the absence of nanoparticle. While the anisotropy of RB molecules in the absence of nanoparticle has remained almost constant(0.075+/-0.029) over long times; anisotropy in the presence of particles showed wide range of values immediately after excitation.&#xd;
Surprisingly high anisotropy values, at about 10 ns after excitation, were observed with a mean of about (0.145+/-0.025). We interpret the high and low initial anisotropies of the clusters, relative to the case of RB alone, to be due to the interaction of dye molecules with collective plasmon modes of the clusters.</description>

   <description>Electroabsorption modulators (EAMs) are fundamental components in optical communication systems. Their response is governed by a set of parameters inherent to their internal structure and by the external electrical components used to drive them. The first part of this thesis discusses a new method for the extraction of values for these parameters. The use of EAMs as both optical modulators and photodetectors is exploited for the purpose of parameter extraction. The proposed method allows the estimation of the parameters which govern the internal frequency response of EAMs without any knowledge of the characteristics of the electrical interconnect used to drive them. The procedure also removes the need for an accurately calibrated optical transmitter and receiver pair normally used during the characterization of optoelectronic components. Analytic description and experimental verification are presented. In the second part of this thesis, direct demultiplexing of a 10 Gbit/s channel from a 160 Gbit/s optical time division multiplexing (OTDM) signal using a single lumped, electrically driven EAM is experimentally presented for the first time. Direct demultiplexing is made possible by using an electrical driving signal for the EAM consisting of a sum of in-phase harmonics of the base channel rate. The use of a single EAM as an optical gate is quasi-analytically compared with the common approach of cascading two EAMs when performing 160 Gbit/s to 10 Gbit/s demultiplexing. The analysis reveals that the use of a single EAM is beneficial in terms of lower penalty with respect to degradations in the extinction ratio and width of the pulses used in the OTDM signal. The last part of this thesis introduces an electrical distributed oscillator which works in a regime of oscillation similar to that of mode locked laser (MLL) systems. The oscillator offers the flexibility of producing other waveforms not found in MLLs and has the potential to generate the required electrical driving signal for a single EAM OTDM demultiplexer. Other possible applications of the oscillator include the generation of short pulses for use in radar systems and wireless personal area networks.</description>

   <description>Terra mine is an abandoned copper and silver mine in the Northwest Territories, Canada, from which mine tailings were deposited into Ho-Hum Lake, adjacent to the mine’s processing plant. The tailings contain elevated levels of arsenic (As), resulting in As levels exceeding Canadian sediment and water quality guidelines in the lake, and in downstream wetland water and sediment. This field and laboratory study focuses on the microbial ecology, and the reduction and oxidation of As, iron (Fe) and sulphur (S), in the wetland downstream from Ho-Hum Lake. This wetland is proposed as a passive remediation system for removal and storage of As.&#xd;
&#xd;
Using microcosm experiments, the stability of As-bearing sediments was compared in the upper, middle and lowestmost areas of the wetland over a 42-day period. Fresh sediments and sediments amended with a 10 mM acetate solution, both mixed with water, were compared. While no significant geochemical differences were found between acetate-amended and unamended microcosms, formation of inorganic As-S species was higher in amended microcosms, suggesting that micro-organisms were  more active in the system because they were not carbon-limited. Formation of methylated-As species increased over time in all samples, including abiotic controls. Bacterial sulphate reduction occurred during the first 10 days of the experiment, perhaps resulting in precipitation of sulphide minerals. X-ray adsorption near edge spectroscopy was used to assess solid-state speciation of As in the sediments and indicated that pre-microcosm sediments from all sites showed high proportions of  As(III)-S and As(III)-O speciation. Post-microcosm sediments revealed a 13% increase in the proportion of As(V)-O species, whereas abiotic controls showed only an 8% increase. DNA sequencing in post-microcosm sediments identified As, Fe and S reducing bacteria, and the geochemical patterns of As, Fe and S in the microcosms indicate the bacteria are likely active in the system. &#xd;
&#xd;
Microbial diversity and solid-state speciation of As in the sediments were assessed at varying depths at the microcosm sites, but correlation analysis revealed no significant relationship between As speciation and microbial diversity. A positive correlation between diversity and depth, and a negative relationship between As concentration and diversity, were found, perhaps indicating decreasing contamination with depth in the wetland.</description>

   <description>Julian Barnes, Pat Barker, and Hanif Kureishi are all canonical authors whose fictions are widely believed to reflect the cultural and political state of a nation that is post-war, post-imperial and post-modern.  While much has been written on how Barker’s and Kureishi’s early works in particular respond to and intervene in the presiding political narrative of the 1980s – Thatcherism – treatment of how revenants of Thatcherism have shaped these writers’ works from 1990 on has remained cursory.  Thatcherism is more than an obvious historical reference point for Barker, Barnes, and Kureishi; their works demonstrate a sophisticated understanding of how Thatcher’s reworkings of the repertoires of Englishness – a representational as well as political and cultural endeavour – persist beyond her time in office.  Barnes, Barker, and Kureishi seem to have reached the same conclusion as political and cultural critics: Thatcher and Thatcherism have remade not only the contemporary political and cultural landscapes but also the electorate and consequently the English themselves.  Tony Blair’s conception of the New Britain proved less than satisfactory because contemporary repertoires of Englishness repeat and rework historical and not incidentally imperial formulations of England and Englishness rather than envision civic and populist formulations of renewal.  Barnes’s England, England and Arthur &amp; George confront the discourse of inevitability that has come to be attached to contemporary formulations of both political and cultural Englishness – both in terms of its predictable demise and its belated celebration.  Kureishi’s The Buddha of Suburbia and “The Body” speak to an alteration that has taken place in which historical Englishness and Thatcherism have become complementary rather than contrasting discourses.  What Barker’s Border Crossing and Double Vision offer against this backdrop is a subtle interrogation of how renewal itself comes to be a presiding mode of cultural reflection that absorbs revolutionary possibility.</description>

   <description>Smart Growth criteria developed by the APA is used to evaluate three methods of zoning. Zoning models were developed as they would relate to an existing neighbourhood in order to limit bias. The zoning methods considered are: the existing Euclidean zoning, Form Based Code via the SmartCode developed by DPZ, and hybrid zoning via Elliot's principles for Improved Hybrid Euclidean Zoning.</description>

   <description>Police and Canadian citizens often clash during protests sometimes resulting in violent outcomes.  Due to the nature of those altercations, there are few other events that require oversight more than the way police clash with protesters and there is a history of such oversight resulting in a number of Federal Parliamentary documents, Parliamentary Committee reports Task Force reports, reports arising from Public Interest Hearings of the Commission for Complaints Against the RCMP, and testimony at various hearings and inquiries which have produced particular argumentative discourses.  Argumentative discourses that have a great effect on the construction of a civilian oversight agency of the RCMP is the focus of this thesis.  This thesis examines how it is that different discourses, as represented by argumentative themes in these reports, intersect with one another in the process of creating a system of accountability for the RCMP.  Through the lens of complaints that arise from protest and police clashes one may conclude that the current system of accountability does not adhere to a practice of protecting the most fundamental rights as prescribed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms; nor would the currently proposed legislation contained within Bill C-38 alter the system in a substantial way to allow for such protections.  The power dynamic between the Commissioner of the Force and the Commission for Complaints Against the RCMP favours the police force in the current and proposed system.  In order for the current political landscape to become a climate favourable toward producing a system of RCMP accountability that truly protects the rights and freedoms prescribed in the Charter, a significant shift must occur in different organizations, agencies, and individuals who influence the creation of legislation and policy in this nation.  This shift must be characterized by an increase in strengthening the commitment of the RCMP to protect the rights and freedoms as prescribed by the Charter rather than its current focus and interest in trying to stem the erosion of public trust and confidence in the Force.</description>

   <description>Foreign pathogens are recognized by toll-like receptors (TLR), present on various immune cells such as professional antigen-presenting cells (pAPCs). On recognition of its ligand, these receptors activate pAPCs, which may in turn influence naïve CD8+ T cell activation and affect their abilities to clear viral infection. However, how TLR ligands (TLR-L) can regulate CD8+ T cell responses have not been fully elucidated. This thesis will focus on examining how the presence of components from foreign pathogens, e.g. viral or bacterial infection, can contribute to shaping host immunity during concurrent viral infections. &#xd;
	Since nitric oxide (NO), an innate effector immune molecule, was recently suggested to regulate proteasome activity; we sought to examine if NO can influence MHC-I antigen presentation during viral infections. The data in this section of the thesis provides evidence that combined TLR engagement can alter the presentation of certain CD8+ epitopes due to NO-induced inhibition in proteasome activity. Taken together, the data demonstrate that TLR ligation can influence the adaptive immune response due to induction of specific innate effector molecules such as NO.&#xd;
Next, the influence of combined TLR engagement on CD8+ T cell immunodominance hierarchies during viral infections was examined. In this section, we established that dual TLR2 and TLR3 stimulation alters immunodominance hierarchies of LCMV epitopes as a result of reduced uptake of cell-associated antigens and reduced cross-presentation of NP396 consequently suppressing NP396-specific CD8+ T cell responses. These findings are significant as they highlight a new role for TLR ligands in regulating anti-viral CD8+ T cell responses through impairing cross-presentation of cell-associated antigens depending on the type of TLR present in the environment during infections.&#xd;
	Finally, we addressed TLR ligand induced type I interferon production and the signalling pathways that regulate them in two different mouse macrophage populations – those derived from the spleen or bone marrow. In this study, we observed that concomitant TLR2 stimulation blocked the induction of type I IFN induced by TLR4 in bone marrow-derived macrophages, but not spleen-derived macrophages in SOCS3-dependent manner.&#xd;
	Taken together, the data presented in this thesis have defined new facets of how anti-viral responses are regulated by TLR activation, especially if multiple receptors are engaged simultaneously.</description>

   <description>Structural topology optimization has been extensively studied in aeronautical, civil, and mechanical engineering applications in order to improve performance of systems. This thesis focuses on an optimal design of damping treatment using topology optimization, and the reduction of computational expense of the topology optimization procedure.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis presents mainly two works on topology optimization. In the first work, topology optimization is implemented to optimally design damping treatments in unconstrained-layer damping material. Since the damping effect relies on the placement of damping treatment, and the weight of damping material may be an important factor, the placement of damping material is optimally determined using topology optimization with an allowable maximum. Unconstrained-layer plate and shell structures are modeled. The damping layer on the unconstrained-layer structures is considered as the design domain. Using topology optimization, the damping layer is designed numerically, and then experimentally validated by comparing the damping effects. In the numerical example, the topological damping treatment usually provides much higher damping effects compared to other approaches such as strain energy distribution (SED) and an evolutionary structural optimization (ESO).&#xd;
&#xd;
In the second work, a numerical algorithm, named as reducible design variable method (RDVM) topology optimization, is proposed in order to efficiently reduce the computational expense. Since it usually requires thousands to millions of design variables and up to hundreds of iterations in topology optimization, the major difficulty is its computational expense. The RDVM topology optimization is implemented into static (minimization of compliance) and dynamic (maximization of the fundamental resonance frequency) problems. The RDVM significantly reduces computing time, as confirmed by numerical examples.</description>

   <description>Impulse control, an executive process that restrains inappropriate actions, is impaired in numerous psychiatric conditions. This thesis reports three experiments that utilized a novel animal model of impulse control, the response inhibition (RI) task, to examine the substrates that underlie learning this task.&#xd;
     In the first experiment, rats were trained to withhold responding on the RI task, and then euthanized for electrophysiological testing. Training in the RI task increased the AMPA/NMDA ratio at the synapses of pyramidal neurons in the prelimbic, but not infralimbic, region of the medial prefrontal cortex. This enhancement paralleled performance as subjects underwent acquisition and extinction of the inhibitory response.&#xd;
AMPA/NMDA was elevated only in neurons that project to the ventral striatum. Thus, this experiment identified a synaptic correlate of impulse control.&#xd;
     In the second experiment, a separate group of rats were trained in the RI task prior to electrophysiological testing. Training in the RI task produced a decrease in membrane excitability in prelimbic, but not infralimbic, neurons as measured by maximal spiking evoked in response to increasing current injection. Importantly, this decrease was strongly correlated with successful inhibition in the task. Fortuitously, subjects trained in an operant control condition showed elevated infralimbic, but not prelimbic, excitability, which was produced by learning an anticipatory signal that predicted imminent reward availability. These experiments revealed two cellular correlates of performance, corresponding to learning two different associations under distinct task conditions.&#xd;
     In the final experiment, rats were trained on the RI task under three conditions: Short (4-s), long (60-s), or unpredictable (1-s to 60-s) premature phases. These conditions produced distinct errors on the RI task. Interestingly, amphetamine increased premature responding in the short and long conditions, but decreased premature responding in the unpredictable condition. This dissociation may arise from interactions&#xd;
between amphetamine and underlying cognitive processes, such as attention, timing, and conditioned avoidance.&#xd;
     In summary, this thesis showed that learning to inhibit a response produces distinct synaptic, cellular, and pharmacological changes. It is hoped that these advances will provide a starting point for future therapeutic interventions of disorders of impulse control.</description>

   <description>This dissertation examines geographies of schooling in relation to how a group of new teachers in Canada conceptualize “inner city” schooling as a uniquely Canadian construct. The study uses a critical approach that explores issues of race, and their intersections with issues of gender, social class, and other identity markers. Seven new teachers graduating from a 2009-2010 teacher education program in the province of Ontario, Canada took part in this study. As a function of the inner city, the inner city school is problematized as a particular geographical space, complete with its own meanings. Results of this study indicate that new teacher conceptualizations of Canadian inner city schools are not uniform and coherent, but complex, contradictory, and dependent upon each individual teacher’s experiences with difference. Overall, participants demonstrated limited ability to speak to their own racial identities in relation to teaching in such schooling contexts. Because most participants learned to teach in predominantly White field-placement settings, they perceived race to be a non-issue and recognized it as a construct only if raced bodies were present. With respect to issues of gender, participants most often discussed what is often referred to as the feminization of teaching in elementary schools. However, there was a profound sense in which inner city schools were conceptualized as “male space” or as space from which female teachers needed protection. This was informed by a widespread conception that male teachers could more effectively manage inner city students. Classroom management emerged as an issue that concerned participants with the least experience with difference. Finally, there was a direct relationship between the theoretical approaches used by the teacher education program in discussing inner city schooling and individual teacher ability to articulate their pedagogical approaches to teaching in this milieu.</description>

   <description>Understanding enzymatic reactions has many invaluable implications that could lead to useful pharmaceutical and commercial applications. Phosphoryl transfer reactions are perhaps the most prevalent chemical transformations in Nature. Phosphate esters are highly resistant to hydrolytic and nucleophilic degradation in the absence of catalysts, and enzymes that faciliate phosphoryl transfer reactions are among the most catalytically efficient enzymes in Nature. &#xd;
	A common strategy for understanding enzyme catalysis involves designing small molecule enzyme mimics. Our approach is to focus on the reaction medium inside the enzyme active sites, which is generally accepted to be non-aqueous and have an effective dielectric constant like organic solvents. We find that by switching from water to light alcohols (methanol and ethanol), a dinuclear Zn(II) complex can accelerate the solvolytic cleavages of simple phosphate diesters (both DNA and RNA models) by 12 orders of magnitude relative to the background reactions. A series of detailed mechanistic investigations revealed that the catalyzed cleavage of phosphate diesters proceeds via a multi-step process. Furthermore, comparison between the catalysis observed in methanol and ethanol is provided. In addition, the rate-limiting step of the three-step catalytic process changes depending on the leaving groups of the substrates for the transesterification of a series of 2-hydroxylpropyl aryl phosphates promoted by 3.3:2Zn(II).&#xd;
	The same dinuclear Zn(II) complex is also very efficient at catalyzing the methanolysis of a series of methyl aryl phosphates (DNA models). Additional catalysis through leaving group assistance was observed for methyl aryl phosphates that contain ortho-nitro and ortho-carbomethoxy substituents. To better understand the effectiveness of leaving group assistance in phosphoryl transfer reactions, we studied the solvolytic cleavage of a homologous set of phosphate mono-, di-, and triesters in methanol, and found that the reactions can be greatly accelerated solely through Cu(II)-promoted leaving group stabilization.&#xd;
	Finally, to highlight the importance of the reaction medium, in the last chapter we present an unprecedented result whereby, in ethanol containing trace amounts of water, the same dinuclear Zn(II) catalyst can preferentially promote the hydrolysis of a DNA model substrate with catalytic efficacy that matches enzyme catalysis.</description>

   <description>Despite a long history of multicultural education initiatives in Ontario (Chan, 2007), Harper (1997) argues that “racially motivated violence, gender and sexual harassment, and cultural and class conflict that continue to occur in Ontario schools” demonstrate the need for new and better ways to respond to student diversity (p. 203).  The Ontario Ministry of Education responded to these inadequacies by mandating that school boards develop equity and inclusive education policies, as specified in Policy/Program Memorandum No. 119 (2009) Developing and Implementing Equity and Inclusive Education Policies in Ontario Schools.  Still, a considerable and observable gap exists between the goals of policy and the realities of practice in many Ontario schools.  A necessary starting point in analyzing this gap is to examine the development of equity education policy in Ontario as documented in PPM No. 119 (2009).  &#xd;
	Relying on document analysis and policy analysis as the sole methods of data collection, I documented the ideological, socio-cultural, political, legal, and economic context from which PPM No. 119 (2009) developed in order to understand what groups of stakeholders were included in the development of PPM No. 119 (2009) and whose values the policy document ultimately represents.	&#xd;
	Collected documents that represent both the federal and provincial level of policymaking and a variety of regional stakeholders and policy actors illustrated that, despite a shift to focus on equity, conceptions of liberal multiculturalism continue to influence education policy in Ontario.  Authoritative decision makers at the Ontario Ministry of Education ultimately trumped the recommendations made by a variety of stakeholder groups and policy actors during the process of policy decision-making.&#xd;
	I concluded that the process of equity education policy development must become a more inclusive process, reflecting the identities, values, and experiences of school administrators, teachers, and students.  However, if the goals of equity in education remain framed within the discourse of liberal multiculturalism and the hierarchical process of policymaking is not deconstructed, the goal of equity may continue to evade Ontario’s education system.</description>

   <subject>Rapid Transit Stations</subject>

   <description>This report focuses on pedestrian-oriented design considerations as they relate to rapid transit station facilities. BC Transit, the provider of transit services across British Columbia (excluding Vancouver), and the Capital Regional District, have jointly initiated the Victoria Regional Rapid Transit Project (VRRTP) with the intent of establishing a high quality rapid transit corridor between Victoria’s Downtown and the Westshore. To date, the VRRTP has established a preferred alignment along the Trans-Canada Highway but has not chosen the technology (LRT or BRT) or station locations &amp; design. The need for better integration between new transit investment and pedestrian requirements is established within BC Transit’s 2030 Strategic Plan Shaping Our Future. This report supports the action item of leveraging new transit station investment to better integrate pedestrian facilities and to ensure their needs are considered during station design. By determining what design features make a rapid transit station pedestrian-friendly this report will be able to establish a set of recommended design guidelines for BC Transit to consider when designing station-areas for the VRRTP. This study will therefore seek to establish: 1) What station-area design features are critical for establishing a pedestrian-oriented rapid transit facility? 2) What recommended guidelines can an analysis of the four case study stations and pedestrian-oriented facility design literature offer BC Transit in designing its own rapid transit facilities in Victoria?</description>

   <description>In a reverberant enclosure, acoustic speech signals are degraded by reflections from&#xd;
walls, ceilings, and objects. Restoring speech quality and intelligibility from reverberated speech has received increasing interest over the past few years. Although multiple channel dereverberation methods provide some improvements in speech quality/&#xd;
intelligibility, single-channel dereverberation remains an open challenge. Two types of advanced single-channel dereverberation methods, namely acoustic domain spectral subtraction and modulation domain filtering, provide small improvement in speech quality and intelligibility. In this thesis, we study single-channel dereverberation algorithms. Firstly, an&#xd;
upper bound of time-frequency masking (TFM) performance for dereverberation is&#xd;
obtained using ideal time-frequency masking (ITFM). ITFM has access to both the&#xd;
clean and reverberated speech signals in estimating the binary-mask matrix. ITFM&#xd;
implements binary masking in the short time Fourier transform (STFT) domain, preserving&#xd;
only those spectral components less corrupted by reverberation. The experiment&#xd;
results show that single-channel ITFM outperforms four existing multi-channel&#xd;
dereverberation methods and suggest that large potential improvements could be&#xd;
obtained using TFM for speech dereverberation. Secondly, a novel modulation domain spectral subtraction method is proposed for dereverberation. This method estimates modulation domain long reverberation spectral variance (LRSV) from time domain LRSV using a statistical room impulse response (RIR) model and implements spectral subtraction in the modulation domain. On one hand, different from acoustic domain spectral subtraction, our method&#xd;
implements spectral subtraction in the modulation domain, which has been shown&#xd;
to play an important role in speech perception. On the other hand, different from&#xd;
modulation domain filtering which uses a time-invariant filter, our method takes the&#xd;
changes of reverberated speech spectral variance along time into account and implements spectral subtraction adaptively. Objective and informal subjective tests show&#xd;
that our proposed method outperforms two existing state-of-the-art single-channel&#xd;
dereverberation algorithms.</description>
