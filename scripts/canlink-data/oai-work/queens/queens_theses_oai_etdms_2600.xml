   <description>The impact of a tri-substituted boron moiety on the chelate sensitization of Tb(III) and Eu(III) lanthanide luminescence and their resulting photophysical properties was investigated. Two triarylboron-functionalized carboxylate ligands 1 and 2 and their respective Tb(III) and Eu(III) complexes, 1Tb, 2Tb, 1Eu and 2Eu were synthesized and fully characterized. The photophysical properties of these compounds were studied and it was established that these three-coordinate boron ligands are highly effective in selective activation of Tb(III) and Eu(III) luminescence yielding high efficiency green and red luminescence, respectively. Potential applications of these triarylboron-functionalized chelate Tb(III) and Eu(III) complexes as luminescent sensors for dipicolinic acid (DPA), a biomarker for anthrax spores, as well as small anions such as F- and CN- in organic solution were examined by titration experiments using UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence emission measurements. Further studies were carried out into the application of the lanthanide complexes as solid substrate luminescent sensors for the same analytes.&#xd;
Furthermore a novel zinc-binding compound, composed of both an 8-hydroxyquinoline fluorophore and a dipyridyl metal binding site, was designed for application as a luminescent sensor for Zn(II), due to the recent link between the metal ion and certain high-profile neurological conditions such as Alzheimer’s and epilepsy. The target ligand compound 1-OH was successfully synthesized and characterized using UV-Vis, Fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy. Further studies of the ligand are recorded by studying the effects of the addition of both four-coordinate boron and tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminum active sites to the 1-OH molecule frame. The four compounds’ abilities in luminescent Zn(II) detection in organic media were examined by titration experiments with Zn(II) using UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence emission measurements.</description>

   <description>In this work, experimental and theoretical approaches are applied to the study of chemical reaction&#xd;
dynamics. In Chapter 2, two applications of transition state theory are presented: (1) Application of&#xd;
microcanonical transition state theory to determine the rate constant of dissociation of C2F3I&#xd;
after π∗ ← π excitation. It was found that this reaction has a very fast rate constant&#xd;
and thus&#xd;
is a promising system for testing the statistical assumption of molecular reaction dynamics. (2) A general&#xd;
rate constant expression for the reaction of atoms and molecules at surfaces was derived within the statistical&#xd;
framework of flexible transition state theory.&#xd;
In Chapter 4, a computationally efficient TDDFT approach was found to&#xd;
produce useful potential energy surface landscapes for application to non-adiabatic predissociative dynamics&#xd;
of the molecule CS2 after excitation from the ground state to the singlet C-state. In Chapter 5, ultrafast&#xd;
experimental results of excitation of CS2 to the predissociative neutral singlet C-state is presented. The&#xd;
bandwidth of the excitation laser was carefully tuned to span a two-component scattering resonance with each&#xd;
component differently evolving electronically with respect to excited state character during the quasi-bound&#xd;
oscillation. Scalar time-resolved photoelectron spectra (TRPES) and vector time-resolved photoelectron&#xd;
angular distribution (TRPAD) observables were recorded during the predissociation. The TRPES yield of&#xd;
photoelectrons was found to oscillate with a quantum beat pattern for the photoelectrons corresponding to&#xd;
ionization to the vibrationless cation ground state; this beat pattern was obscured for photoelectron energies&#xd;
corresponding to ionization from the vibrationally excited CS2 cation. The TRPAD data was recorded for&#xd;
two general molecular ensemble cases: with and without a pre-excitation alignment laser pulse. It was found&#xd;
that in the case of ensemble alignment (Chapter 6), the “molecular frame” TRPAD (i.e. TRMFPAD) was&#xd;
able to image the purely valence electronic dynamics of the evolving CS2 C-state. The unaligned ensemble&#xd;
TRPAD observable suffers from excessive orientational averaging and was unable to observe the quantum&#xd;
beat.&#xd;
Engineering efforts were also undertaken to eliminate scattered light background signal (Chapter 7,&#xd;
Appendix A) and improve laser stability as a function of ambient pressure (Appendix B) for TRMFPAD&#xd;
experiments.</description>

   <description>This thesis probes the ways in which land-based and bodily violence inform contemporary North American Indigenous poetry.  Since the “Oka Crisis” of 1990, English-speaking North American Indigenous writers have produced a substantial body of poetry that has significant implications in forwarding national sovereignty struggles. Gender violence enabled settler colonial land appropriation; resource exploitation also harmed Indigenous bodies. This project considers the ways in which Indigenous authors with diverse geographic, cultural and embodied experiences employ common strategies toward using poetry as an emancipatory tool. A poem is both whole, and a fragment of a larger body of work; engaging with the works of individual poets, and multi-authored anthologies allows for varied readings of the same poems and their engagements with the project’s key themes of homeland and embodiment. This paper is informed by the reading of many Indigenous theorists and poets, and aligns with an Indigenous-feminist critique that suggests that nationalist sovereignty struggles are meaningless as long as bodily violence against Indigenous women and Two-Spirit people is still prevalent. As such, contemporary struggles for reclaiming Indigenous lands must also be struggles toward a sovereign erotic, sovereignty over one’s sexuality and gender identity.</description>

   <description>Our perceptual systems can create a rich representation of the social cues gathered during social interaction. Very brief exposures or ‘thin slices’ of behavioural and linguistic information are sufficient for making accurate judgments regarding social situations and building these social representations. This is akin to our accurate recognition of static visual stimuli with brief exposures to a scene in the study of scene gist (Oliva, 2005). This thesis examines a specific social cue during social interaction - how the correlation of movement between two people varies as a result of their affiliation. Further, this thesis investigates how we perceive that behavioural cue when making judgments of affiliation while observing conversation.    It has already been established that there is coordination of linguistic and behavioural information during social interaction (Ambady &amp; Rosenthal, 1992). This coordination is more prominent when individuals are familiar with each than when they are not (Dunne &amp; Ng, 1994). The first study in this thesis quantifies the variation in the coordination of movement between two people in conversation based on their affiliation. Results demonstrate that the correlation of movements between friends is greater than the correlation during stranger interaction. This experiment demonstrates that movement varies as a result of affiliation and that people could use this coordination as a cue when making accurate judgments of affiliation while observing social interaction. The second study used the analysis of movement correlation to examine how correlation serves as a cue for accuracy of affiliation judgment by observers. Results demonstrate that although correlation was not a significant cue in affiliation perception, participants could indeed do the perceptual task. These results suggest that the perception of social information is multi-faceted and many cues contribute to its perception. These findings are discussed in terms of our sensitivity to more specific movement correlations as opposed to the global correlations used in this study. These studies highlight the need for further investigation in how behavioural cues function within the judgment of social information.</description>

   <description>This thesis studies the role of multi-stage production for the monetary transmission mechanism. I employ a monetary search model to show how multi-stage production influences both the long run and the short run effects of money growth. Multi-stage production provides an additional channel for money growth having effects through intermediate goods between different production stages. Extending Shi's (1998) model from a single-stage to a multi-stage production model, I show that money growth rate has an unconventional long run effect on quantities per match, and the long run response of input inventory investment is different from that of output inventory investment. Contrary to classic search models, the steady state effect of money growth on the quantity of finished goods per match is not monotonic and depends on the money growth rate. Furthermore, in steady state the quantities per match first increase with the growth rate of money, before falling for large growth rates. Input inventories arise due to search frictions. Money growth also has hump-shaped real effects on steady state input inventory investment. The intermediate goods build a bridge between the labor market and the finished goods market. Intuitively, households hire more labor with higher future revenue and produce more intermediate goods in order to match the employment level. With more labor and more intermediate goods, finished goods producers can produce more when matched. As a consequence, they are stuck with more input inventories. Moreover, my model suggests that changes in the money growth rate would be one of the reasons for the decline of the inventory-to-sales ratio since the mid-1980s. Finally, I calibrate my model to quarterly US data. Contrary to other work, my model is able to replicate the stylized facts on inventory movements over the business cycle by solely relying on monetary shocks. The theoretical impulse response functions can quantitatively reproduce the corresponding empirical ones estimated in a structure autoregressive model. Moreover, the quantitative analysis supports the argument that input inventories amplify aggregate fluctuations over business cycles.</description>

   <description>We sought to determine if compensatory vasodilator and/or pressor responses protect exercising muscle O2 delivery (O2D) under conditions of reduced arterial perfusion pressure, if this is exercise intensity-dependent, and if distinct cardiovascular response phenotypes exist.  Ten healthy male subjects (19.5±0.4 years) completed two trials of a ramp protocol forearm isometric handgrip exercise test to exhaustion (2.5 kg increments every 3.5 minutes) in each of forearm above and below heart level (forearm arterial perfusion pressure (FAPP) difference of 29.5±0.97 mmHg).   Forearm blood flow ((FBF (ml/min; brachial artery Doppler and echo ultrasound), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP; finger photoplethysmography), and exercising forearm venous effluent (ante-cubital vein catheter) measurements at the end of each work rate (WR) revealed the following.  Group level (n=10) Δ FBF was compromised beyond 5 kg WR in above vs. below (P&lt;0.05).  There was no evidence of compensatory vasodilator (P=0.21) or pressor (P=0.63) responses. Peak O2D, WR and VO2 were significantly compromised by reduced FAPP (115.6±16.8 vs. 152.0±13.4 mlO2/min, 25.5±1.22 vs. 28.94±1.50 kg and 75.9±5.3 vs. 100.2±8.6 ml/min; P&lt;0.05).  In contrast, examination of individual responses revealed distinct cardiovascular response groups with (n=6) vs. without (n=4) compensatory vasodilation with the former having less compromise to submaximal O2D and peak WR (-94.12±23.42 vs. -223.40±36.01 mlO2/min), P&lt;0.05 and -2.5±0.32 vs. -5.32±0.79 kg, P&lt;0.05).  In conclusion, exercising forearm muscle hypoperfusion due to reduced FAPP is not compensated for by pressor responses.  However, there appear to be distinct phenotypes in which vasodilatory compensation does vs. does not occur, which in the former partially protects O2D and exercise performance.</description>

   <description>The E2A proteins are transcription factors critical for B-lymphopoiesis. A chromosomal translocation involving the E2A gene promotes acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) through expression of the oncoprotein E2A-PBX1. Two activation domains of E2A-PBX1, AD1 and AD2, have been implicated in transcription mediated by recruitment of the transcriptional co-activator CBP/p300. A motif has been identified within AD1 that is important for recruiting CBP/p300, known as PCET. This recruitment requires an interaction between the activation domains of E2A-PBX1 and the KIX domain of CBP/p300. The KIX domain recognizes a generic ΦXXΦΦ sequence (Φ corresponds to a hydrophobic residue) found in the activation domains of numerous transcription factors. Mutation of leucine 20 in PCET has been shown to abrogate ex vivo immortalization of murine bone marrow and oncogenesis in a murine bone marrow transplantation model. A similar sequence is also found in AD2 and is implicated in E2A transcriptional activity and recruitment of CBP/p300.  The structural details of these interactions remain largely unknown. &#xd;
NMR spectroscopy was used to determine the solution structure of the PCET:KIX complex, and the functional consequences of the Leu20Ala mutation were structurally rationalized. Other PCET mutations informed by this structure were tested and correlations were found between in vitro binding affinities and both transcriptional activation and immortalization. The binding site of the ΦXXΦΦ-containing E2A AD2 peptide was mapped to the same site on the KIX domain used by the PCET motif. A model of this complex was generated and mutations were tested using a similar approach as was used for PCET. E2A AD2 binds the KIX domain with lower affinity than the PCET motif and is not required for immortalizing bone marrow. A mutation that increases the affinity of E2A AD2 for the KIX domain to levels approaching that seen for the PCET:KIX interaction restores transcriptional activation and immortalization, demonstrating that immortalization by E2A-PBX1 is an affinity dependent process involving the KIX domain of CBP/p300. These studies indicate that the activation domains of E2A-PBX1 serve to support the in vivo function of the oncoprotein and that the PCET:KIX complex is a potential target for novel therapeutics in E2A-PBX1+ leukemia.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, French) -- Queen's University, 2012-09-14 11:13:17.318</description>
   <description>This study focuses on the trilogy of Yolande Mukagasana, a survivor of the 1994 genocide against the Tutsis in Rwanda: La mort ne veut pas de moi (1997), N'aie pas peur de savoir (1999) and Les Blessures du silence (2001). The reading of Mukagasana's works about genocide raises the question of the unspeakable. On the one hand, the language struggles to express the witness’s suffering. On the other hand, the experience of the genocide does not have landmarks for the witness who undertakes the task to tell her story. The topic addressed in the second chapter of this thesis is about the difficulty and the urgency to testify which prompt the witness to use different discursive strategies to approach the horror and convince the reader of the truth of her story. The analysis confirms with examples that the literary testimony does not use less literary devices than fictional texts. The third chapter addresses the preservation of the memory of the genocide and its victims. It also talks about justice that has to punish the perpetrators of the greatest crime against humanity. The thesis wraps up by looking at the cathartic function of the testimony.</description>

   <description>An analytical model is presented for the interpretation of pumping tests conducted in a fractured rock aquifer. The solution accommodates multiple horizontal fractures intersecting pumping and observation wells with interconnecting vertical fracture features. The uppermost horizontal fracture is connected via this fracture network to a free surface boundary. Wellbore storage is included at the pumping and observation wells using an approximate superposition technique and the solution is derived using the Laplace transform method. Evaluation is performed by numerical inversion using the Talbot algorithm. Sensitivity of the model to the governing hydraulic parameters for both pumping and observation well data is presented for a realistic range of values for fractured rock.  A field example is given to demonstrate the application of the model and to explore the uniqueness of the interpreted values. Based on the results obtained using the present analytical model, estimation of unique values of the vertical hydraulic parameters in a sedimentary rock setting may not be possible using pumping test results. &#xd;
&#xd;
Subsequently, measuring aquifer properties from various testing methods was investigated to explore the significance of fracture heterogeneities relative to tested volumes and to determine which testing methods were capable of producing reliable parameter estimates. The hydrogeological study was performed in a fractured sedimentary rock aquifer using four different field testing methods: constant head tests, pulse interference tests, 12-hour isolated interval pumping tests and 48-hour open-hole pumping tests. Particular emphasis was placed on the reliable estimation of vertical hydraulic parameters in this setting. The evaluation of the pumping test data was performed using the analytical model derived earlier to determine whether the new pumping test model could produce confident estimates of vertical hydraulic parameters. &#xd;
While estimates of horizontal hydraulic conductivity measurements were not affected by test method, open-well pumping tests do not appear able to predict values of vertical hydraulic conductivity and specific yield. Alternatively, pulse interference tests may be a less time-intensive option to constant head injection tests for determining vertical parameters in a sedimentary rock setting.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Geography) -- Queen's University, 2012-09-17 12:24:42.783</description>
   <description>The aim of this thesis is to analyze social inclusion among young adults with intellectual disabilities in small towns and rural community settings. The specific context is three small towns in south eastern Ontario in 2006/2007. A phenomenological study relying on a hermeneutics cycle is undertaken to derive an understanding from multiple sources. &#xd;
In the first instance, policy documents related to the province's approach to supports for adults with intellectual disabilities, the research literature on experiences of adults with intellectual disabilities in rural communities, and conceptual models of social inclusion were reviewed. Seventeen young adults with intellectual disabilities (20 to 28 years of age), their caregivers (n=13) and other community members (n=20) from the three selected towns were interviewed. The interviews included quantitative tools and open-ended questions. Data from the Canadian census were also used to characterize the towns. The data collected led to quantitative (counts, median scores, proportions) and qualitative (significant statements, formulated meanings, themes) analyses for comparisons within and across towns in order to reveal the role of context in social inclusion. &#xd;
The results highlight the importance of context. While similarities exist among the small towns in the region, they each have unique features which impact on the experience of social inclusion for young adults with intellectual disabilities. Key lessons are learned. Attention needs to be given to the availability and proximity of spaces and structures for interaction. The role played by developmental service agencies needs to be examined critically as it may hinder social inclusion and sense of belonging. &#xd;
As community involvement is easier for those seen as similar and sense of community is stronger among those who see themselves as similar, the socio-demographic profile of a town can be an important factor mitigating for or against social inclusion efforts. Finally, since residents of a small town who have a greater need for supports derive more sense of community from knowing that other residents are willing to help those in need, fostering caring communities may be as important as creating services specific to persons with intellectual disabilities. The need for geographers, epidemiologists and other social and life scientists to study persons with intellectual disabilities within the places where they live remains a research area where there is still much to learn and be done.</description>

   <description>Few studies have compared cortisol responses to psychological and physical stress tasks with or without social evaluation. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) with reactive hyperemia is impaired following acute stress though less is known regarding the impact of stress and cortisol on FMD with exercise induced increases in shear stress (EX-FMD). The purpose of this study was 1) to compare cortisol responses between the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and 5min cold pressor test with and without social evaluation (CPT, CPT+SE) and 2) to examine the impact of these stressors and cortisol elevation on EX-FMD. 59 healthy male subjects were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: TSST, CPT, or CPT+SE. Brachial artery EX-FMD was assessed before, 15 and 35min post-stress with Echo and Doppler ultrasound. Results are mean ± SD. Baseline parameters did not differ between conditions (p>.05) and stress responses were similar between the three conditions for peak cortisol: TSST 11.34±5.53nmol/L; CPT 10.08±4.48nmol/L; CPT+SE 8.51±3.60nmol/L; condition effect p=.292; cortisol responders only (increase >2nmol/L) TSST 12.48±5.24nmol/L; CPT 12.13±5.31nmol/L; CPT+SE 10.70±2.86nmol/L; condition effect p=.560; peak MAP: 131.99 ±18.56mmHg, condition effect p=.664; peak TPR: 25.84 ± 9.78mmHg/L/min, condition effect p=0.841; peak stress rating out of 10: 5.11 ± 2.12, condition effect p= 0.292; with the exception of HR (TSST: 95.06 ± 15.29bpm; CPT: 79.00 ± 11.85bpm; CPT+SE: 77.98 ± 7.66bpm; condition effect p= 0.003) and pain ratings out of 10 (TSST: 1.21 ± 1.72; CPT: 6.66 ± 1.42; CPT+SE: 6.38 ± 1.73; condition effect p&lt;.001). Shear stress was lower in the 15min post-stress vs. pre stress and 35min post-stress trials (72.34 ± 4.46; 15min post-stress: 70.79 ± 5.39; 35min post-stress: 70.60 ± 6.10; condition effect p= 0.592; trial effect: p= 0.018). EX-FMD increased from pre- stress to 15min post-stress in all conditions (pre-stress 6.22 ± 2.75%; 15min-post stress: 7.91 ± 3.24%; 35min post-stress: 6.60 ± 2.93%; trial effect p&lt;.001). No correlation between change in EX-FMD and change in cortisol was detected (r2= 0.0125; p=.404). In conclusion, the TSST, CPT and CPT+SE elicited similar stress responses and stress transiently enhanced EX-FMD. Cortisol responses did not explain the enhanced EX-FMD post stress.</description>

   <description>The development of cost-effective and reliable methods for the synthesis and separation of asymmetric compounds is paramount in helping to meet society’s ever-growing demand for chiral small molecules. Of these methods, chiral heterogeneous supports are particularly appealing as they allow for the reuse of the chiral source. One such support, based on the synergy between chiral organic units and structurally stable inorganic silicon scaffolds are periodic mesoporous organosilicas (PMOs).&#xd;
In the work described herein, I examine some of the factors governing the transmission of chirality between chiral dopants and prochiral bulk phases in chiral PMO materials. In particular, the exploration of 1,1’-binaphthalene-bridged chiral dopants with a focus on the point of attachment into the materials. Moreover, the effects of ordering in the materials are examined and reveal that chirality transfer is more facile in materials with molecular-scale order then those containing amorphous walls.&#xd;
Secondly, the issues surrounding the synthesis and purification of aryl-triethoxysilanes as siloxane precursors are addressed. Both the introduction of a two-carbon linker and the direct attachment of allyl and mixed allyldiethoxysilane species are explored. This work demonstrates that allyldiethoxysilanes are ideal, in that they are stable enough to permit facile synthesis, while still being able to hydrolyze completely to produce well-ordered materials.&#xd;
Lastly, the production of new bulk phases for chiral PMO materials is examined by introducing new prochiral nitrogen-containing siloxane precursors. Biphenyldiamine and bipyridine-bridged siloxane precursors are readily synthesized on reasonable scales. Their use as the bulk siloxane precursor in the production of PMO materials however, is precluded by insufficient gelation and additional siloxane precursors are necessary for the production of ordered materials.&#xd;
In addition to the research detailed above that forms the body of this thesis, two short works are appended. The first details the production of polythiophene assemblies mediated through coordination nanospaces, while the second explores the production of N-heterocyclic carbene functionalized gold nanoparticles through ligand exchange.</description>

   <description>This thesis describes the use of electrospray mass spectrometry, 1H NMR, and UV-visible spectroscopy, along with molecular modeling studies, to characterize the host-guest complexes that are formed between the cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) host molecule and a series of cationic alkylammonium (benzethonium), biguanidinium (metformin, phenformin, chlorhexidine and alexidine), amidinium (berenil, pentamidine, and 4-hydroxy- and 4-aminobenzamidines), and flavylium (4’- and 6-methoxyflavylium and 6,4’-dimethoxyflavylium) guests in aqueous solution. The stoichiometries and binding strengths of the CB[7] host-guest complexes with these series of drug and dye molecules were determined, and have been rationalized in terms of the specific ion-dipole interactions and hydrophobic effects involved.  The potential uses of CB[7] as a slow-release drug delivery agent and molecular stabilizing agent are indicated from kinetic and spectroscopic studies on the reactivities of the host-guest complexes.&#xd;
CB[7] forms 1:1 and 2:1 host-guest complexes with the benzethonium cation by sequential binding to the hydrophilic benzyldimethylammonium group and the hydrophobic 2,4,4-trimethylpentyl group, respectively. The binding strength at the former site is consistent with data for other CB[7]-benzylammonium guests, while the strength of binding of the neutral hydrophobic group results from efficient packing within the inner CB[7] cavity. &#xd;
Each of the biguanidinium guests was shown to form strong 1:1 host-guest complexes with CB[7]. Metformin proved to be small enough to form 1:2 host-guest complexes at low concentrations of CB[7], while chlorhexidine and alexidine were shown to be large enough to form sequential 2:1 and 3:1 host-guest complexes with CB[7]. UV-visible pH titrations showed that CB[7] binds more strongly to mono-protonated metformin than the di-protonated form of this guest.&#xd;
Both pentamidine and berenil formed tightly bound complexes with CB[7], indicating that this host could potentially act as carrier for these drug molecules. CB[7] catalyzes the acid decomposition of berenil and each of the decomposition products, 4-hydroxy- and 4-aminobenzamidinium, bind to CB[7] with increases in their pKa values in the presence of CB[7].&#xd;
The three flavylium dyes, with cationic oxonium centers, were shown to complex strongly with CB[7], resulting in a stabilization of the flavylium cation, with respect to the ring-opened 2-hydroxychalcones in neutral solutions.</description>

   <description>In organizational life, trust breach is a common but destructive phenomenon.  This dissertation explores how a prosocial, virtuous response to trust breach -- interpersonal forgiveness -- might influence the behaviour and attitudes of teams and their members in the wake of such a breach.  In a series of three manuscripts, the dissertation looks at the consequences of forgiveness for the person perceived to have broken a victim’s trust (the transgressor), and for the teammates who observe the breach and the response that follows it.  Forgiveness is described as playing two important roles.  For transgressors, we describe forgiveness as a favour, drawing on social exchange theory to argue that forgiveness triggers reciprocal helping directed at both the victim and the team at large.  And for teammates, we argue that forgiveness serves as a powerful signal, communicating the cohesion and efficacy of the group.  These predictions are tested experimentally with a laboratory study of transgressor-victim dyads (Chapter 2) and of transgressor-victim-teammate triads (Chapter 3), and a series of two vignette studies from the perspective of teammate observers (Chapter 4).  Focusing on the linkages between forgiveness and justice, each study considers the interaction between forgiveness various transgressor-initiated and victim-initiated attempts at restoring justice, including apologies, punishment, and restorative justice practices.  Chapter 5 discusses the mixed support found for our predictions, considers how the limitations of our studies might be addressed, and introduces a series of directions for future research.</description>

   <title>Windows of opportunity: the timing of dispersal events influences zooplankton community response to environmental change in Subarctic ponds</title>

   <description>Theoretical and empirical work has shown that community diversity and composition can be influenced by both local conditions and dispersal from a regional species pool. This may be especially true shortly after environmental disturbances, because perturbations can provide spatial or temporal niche opportunities for dispersers to establish. Theory predicts that after environmental disturbances tolerant functionally-redundant dispersing species can establish in disturbed communities, maintaining local community diversity and ecosystem function; however, this model relies on the successful establishment of dispersers (i.e., the community must be invasible). Invasibility is expected to decline as time-since-disturbance increases because the local community can use freed resources and increases in abundance. Although studies have acknowledged that timing may influence invasibility, very few studies have focused on how dispersal timing influences the role of dispersal in community response to disturbance. My thesis was conducted to test the role of crustacean zooplankton dispersal timing in the establishment success, and subsequent influence on diversity and ecosystem function of dispersers. To assess this, a field mesocosm study was completed in Churchill, Canada to test the effects of disturbance (nutrients and salinity) and immigration timing (from 51 regional ponds/pools) on invasibility, local community structure and ecosystem functioning (i.e., chl-a). Results show that invasibility was initially high following disturbance, but decreased with time- since-disturbance as the resident community exerted priority effects over dispersers. As a result community diversity was most influenced by immigration when dispersers were added shortly after disturbance. Many coarse measures of diversity were resistant to disturbance, but community composition and the relative abundance of functional groups shifted, and likely influence ecosystem function (i.e., chl-a). When dispersers were added to disturbed communities ecosystem function was recovered to undisturbed levels. Overall, my results suggest that&#xd;
dispersal timing can influence the role of dispersal in communities and the ability of species to capitalize on windows of invasion opportunity will influence their ability to establish in favorable local patches.</description>

   <description>In the present study the light dependent biosynthesis of spherical red elemental selenium Se(0) granules (average size of 220 nm) by the cyanobacterium Synechococcus leopoliensis when exposed to high selenite concentrations for 9 days was investigated. The particles were identified as Se(0) by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis and were localized between the periplasmic space and the cell surface through light and environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM). The amount of selenite reduced to Se(0) increased with increasing culture density and less selenite remained in the cultures accordingly. Selenite treated cultures lost their characteristic pigments and turned from green to orange by day 5 and a concomitant increase in the buoyant cell density was observed over the treatment period. The potential abiotic and biotic reactions that may have produced Se(0) in the cyanobacteria are discussed.</description>

   <description>Forest encroachment has been documented across North America, from British Columbia to New Mexico, and is a growing concern due to loss of essential grassland habitat. Climate change, fire suppression, changes in grazing regimes, and differences in microclimate between topographic gradients are the main factors associated with forest encroachment into grasslands. Small-scale factors, such as competition and facilitation also play an important role in forest-grassland dynamics. I examined forest-grassland dynamics in southwest Yukon through dendroecological techniques and repeat image analysis. Dendroecological techniques were used to identify periods of tree encroachment, changes in age structure, pulses of tree establishment and possible correlations with climatic variables. Dendroecological results indicated that over the last 60-80 years, trees have invaded an average of 30 meters into grasslands on south-facing slopes and flat terrain in southwest Yukon. Ecotones on north-facing slopes appear stable with little advance into grasslands over the last 60 years. Results indicate forest encroachment varies across topography and between tree species. Repeat image analysis was also used to examine landscape changes over a 60-year time period near Kluane Lake. Forest encroachment was investigated using landscape metrics which characterized changes in grassland configuration across three time periods (1947, 1979, 2007) in a 10km2 area. Total grassland area decreased from 214.4 hectares in 1947 to 137 hectares in 2007 and coincided with extensive grassland fragmentation. One hundred and seventy grassland patches were identified in 1947 which increased to 270 patches in 2007. Although tree invasion was found across all topographic gradients, results complement dendroecological analyses with flat terrain and south-facing slopes experiencing the greatest loss of grassland. It is possible that the increase in trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) on south-facing slopes and flat terrain is due to warmer temperatures in the area. Aspen establishment coincided with warmer temperatures however further work is needed to identify the influence of changes in fire and grazing regimes. Although southwest Yukon grasslands are limited in distribution they are ecologically significant and provide habitat for unique assemblages of flora and fauna.</description>

   <description>Upstream social determinants of health (SDH) have become widely acknowledged as lying at the root of poor health outcomes in Canada and globally. Conditions of social disadvantage restrict access to both social and physical resources, limiting the opportunity to actively pursue a healthy lifestyle. The Commission on the Social Determinants of Health maintains that educating the public about the SDH is a key step towards population health equity. Educating adolescents may be the most efficient and effective route of SDH knowledge dissemination, as youth are in a stage of peak learning, and are also easily reached through health education curriculum delivered in secondary school. However, health curriculum in Ontario is lacking in SDH content, placing a much greater emphasis on individual, lifestyle behaviors, such as diet, physical activity, and sax sex practices. Identifying a gap in SDH knowledge within this population, and evaluating the benefits of SDH education, is required to advocate for health curriculum revision to include SDH material. This project is designed as both a research study and SDH educational intervention. Concept mapping exercises were used to determine students’ knowledge of the determinants of health and the SDH. The impact of short term SDH education on student retention of SDH material was also evaluated. Student concept maps indicated that students attributed their health primarily to physical determinants versus social determinants; 44% of maps contained no SDH content. Statistical analyses prior to delivering the SDH lessons indicated that students’ SDH knowledge varied by their relative socioeconomic status (SES). Post-lesson analyses indicated however that student SDH knowledge increased significantly, and final levels of SDH knowledge following the SDH lessons was unaffected by socio-demographic variables. Findings suggest that 1) there is an SDH knowledge gap in the adolescent population, 2) an inequity in adolescent SDH knowledge exists across socio-economic factors, and 3) that SDH education can potentially eliminate the inequity in SDH knowledge. Current Ontario health curriculum requires revision to include SDH material. Designing curricula to have an optimal influence on both student learning and adolescent health requires greater communication and collaboration from both educational institutions and health agencies in Canada</description>

   <description>Since its inception in April 2011, “SlutWalk” has grown from a Toronto-based rally and march against victim-blaming and sexual violence into a globalized movement spanning six continents. Given that its mainstream visibility is unprecedented for any contemporary feminist movement, SlutWalk represents a unique opportunity to examine representations of feminist politics in the Canadian mainstream news media. Drawing on the theoretical and methodological tools of feminism and cultural studies, I offer a contextualized reading and discourse analysis of the representations of SlutWalk across print, radio, and televisual media during its first nine months of press. On the surface, the media portrays SlutWalk in a fair and positive light, taking seriously its messages about police accountability, victim solidarity, and women’s liberation as key tenets for ending victim-blaming. Nonetheless, these “fair” messages are constituted by and constitutive of neoliberal, white supremacist, and postfeminist discourses of the “reality” of sexual violence, which undermine intersectional feminist efforts to eradicate sexual violence. I argue that mainstream media representations of SlutWalk reproduce a watered-down version of feminism and a decontextualized understanding of sexual violence that resonates most with white, heteronormative, educated women. Overall, I suggest that the mainstream visibility of SlutWalk is possible only insofar as its representations steer clear of any substantive critique of patriarchal violence as it articulates with racism, heterosexism, and institutional violence. Average media consumers of stories about SlutWalk are most likely afforded a sense that “managing” sexual violence and “liberating” women might be achieved within the existing status quo and through a sole focus on (white) women. In conclusion, I reiterate the need for intervention and engagement with the mainstream reproduction of discourses about feminism, and offer suggestions for how this might be achieved.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Community Health &amp; Epidemiology) -- Queen's University, 2012-09-20 16:44:44.525</description>
   <description>Background: Previous research suggests that children living on farms have a lower prevalence of asthma compared to their more urban counterparts. Four potential explanations may underlie this association: personal factors, health care access, health risk behaviours, and the environmental explanation. &#xd;
Objectives: The objective of this thesis was to first compare the prevalence of asthma between children living on farms and those living in small towns. The second objective was to identify and compare potential risk and protective factors for childhood asthma in rural and farm environments. Finally, we interpreted the findings in light of the above explanations in terms of which is most likely to explain previously observed differences in pediatric asthma prevalence. &#xd;
Methods: We used cross-sectional data (n=834) from a 2003 study conducted in Estevan, Saskatchewan as well as cross-sectional data (n=2,259) collected as part of the Saskatchewan Rural Health Study in 2011. We determined differences in asthma prevalence and examined the distribution of potential risk and protective factors between farm and small town children. Using multiple logistic regression, we identified a number of potential risk and protective factors for both pediatric asthma and wheeze among these populations. &#xd;
Results: No differences in prevalence of asthma or wheeze were identified by farm and small town status in both analyses. Risk factors that were identified included: male sex, parental history of asthma, personal history of allergy, home dampness, being overweight or obese, premature birth, living in a single parent home, difficulty accessing routine healthcare, previous daycare attendance, having a mother that previously smoked, having mice in the home, having an air filter in the home and feeding livestock. Protective factors included: previous daycare attendance, having pets in the home and having a dehumidifier present in the home. Farm-specific protective factors included: filling or emptying grain bins, cleaning or playing in pens, and living on a grain farm.&#xd;
Conclusions: No differences in asthma or wheeze prevalence were identified between small town and farm children in these study populations. Findings primarily supported the environmental explanation for geographic differences in asthma prevalence identified historically, with modest support for the health care access explanation.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of four racialized, male, first-year, international students attending a university in southern Ontario and living in university residence. Through four one-on-one interviews, my qualitative study sought to uncover the challenges, needs, and opportunities of these students. In addition to cultural and academic adjustment, my study focused on how the participants preserved their masculine and cultural/religious identities in a Western university. A secondary purpose of my study was to examine how these four international students experienced living in university residences, what challenges they faced, and how their specific needs were met.&#xd;
Four themes emerged from the interviews. First, the participants outlined their difficulties adjusting to Canadian university culture. While some enjoyed the transition to Canada, others found adjusting their cultural identities challenging. Second, these participants struggled to adjust to the academic rigour and workload during their first year at university. Despite the demands of university academics, the participants generally welcomed the freedom and flexibility of university life, which allowed them to create their own work schedules and engage in their social lives. Third, the participants maintained their masculine and cultural identities, to more or lesser degrees, despite being immersed in the social and cultural norms of Canadian university life. While some felt isolated within Queen’s University because of their different cultural and masculine identities, overall, these participants valued their own identities and resolved to preserve them. Finally, the participants discussed the benefits and challenges of living in university residences. While residences tended to provide the participants with a sense of community and belonging, sometimes it was challenging living in a loud and hectic environment.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Education) -- Queen's University, 2012-09-19 18:09:53.088</description>
   <description>Portuguese-Canadians have historically faced disadvantages in the Canadian education system (Coelho, 1973, 1977; Fonseca, 2010; Morgado, 2009; Noivo, 1997; Nunes, 1999; Ornstein, 2000, 2006; Santos, 2006). While there have been studies conducted into this phenomenon, these disadvantages remain relatively unexplored by the research community and unknown to mainstream society. Furthermore, many of those studies have focused primarily on the various manifestations of the problem of educational disadvantage and have not explored the specific programs or practices adopted by the community to address these issues. &#xd;
&#xd;
Community based educational organizations have been shown to assist in the cultural adjustment process of immigrant youth. These organizations provide youth with the necessary cultural capital to allow them to construct high academic and vocational aspirations, and to cope with the various discouraging experiences they may have in schools (Bielenberg, n.d; James, 2005; James &amp; Haig-Brown, 2001; Zhou, 2005).&#xd;
The purpose of this study was to describe a community-based tutoring and mentoring program and to examine the stakeholders' perceptions of the program's impact on the Portuguese-Canadian students whom it serves, to respond to the educational disadvantages this group faces.&#xd;
This program was established by members of the Portuguese-Canadian community in Toronto as a reaction to data outlining this group's educational disadvantages. Document and transcript analysis provided a rich description of the program and revealed how the program impacted the students whom it served. Specifically, this program supports its students during transitions, helps to address negative schooling experiences, and fosters their acquisition of English. This ultimately results in improvements in these students' academics, social skills, and self-esteem and is having an overall positively impact on their attitudes and perceptions of education.</description>

   <description>Arbitration is one of the oldest legal systems of solving disputes, albeit, it was simple and without any power to enforce the outcome of the tribunal. In modern ages, arbitration has transformed to a more complicated and sophisticated system of solving international commercial disputes. &#xd;
In recent decades, enforcement of tribunal award benefited from various conventions like New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (1958). However the enforcement still has few difficulties. One problem is related to the enforcement of the award in different countries. Based on Article V (2(b)) of New York Convention, countries can prohibit enforcement of award if it is against public policy of that country. This broad definition has created many problems especially in some Islamic countries in Middle East due to frequent use of this defense.&#xd;
Islamic countries in Middle East have tried to implement new arbitration legislations from western countries in order to acclimate themselves with modern International commercial and political relations. However facing biased actions from western countries toward their cultures, have made these adaptations more challenging. &#xd;
Considering the claim of both parties, one should not forget the strong influence of culture in International relations as it defines many actions and concerns of society. Ignoring this issue can create many problems and hostile atmosphere between nations that even affect International commercial arbitration enforcements. &#xd;
Knowing the significance of effect of culture, it is essential for many lawyers, scholars and practitioners to study and learn more about culture and norms of other countries. Multi-cultural countries like Canada and commercial hubs like Dubai can facilitate understanding different cultures by creating cultural and legal centers.</description>

   <description>In this project, by adding selected co-substrates and by incorporating optimum pre-treatment strategies, four experimental phases were conducted to assess the enhancement of biogas production from anaerobic co-digestion using wastewater treatment plant sludge as the primary substrate.&#xd;
    In the first phase, the feasibility of using municipal organic wastes (synthetic kitchen waste (KW) and fat, oil and grease (FOG)) as co-substrates in anaerobic co-digestion was investigated. KW and FOG positively affected biogas production from anaerobic co-digestion, with ideal estimated substrate/inoculum (S/I) ratio ranges of 0.80-1.26 and 0.25-0.75, respectively. Combined linear and non-linear regression models were employed to represent the entire digestion process and demonstrated that FOG could be suggested as the preferred co-substrate. &#xd;
    The effects of ultrasonic and thermo-chemical pre-treatments on the biogas production of anaerobic co-digestion with KW or FOG were investigated in the second phase. Non-linear regressions fitted to the data indicated that thermo-chemical pre-treatment could increase methane production yields from both FOG and KW co-digestion. Thermo-chemical pre-treatments of pH=10, 55°C provided the best conditions to increase methane production from FOG co-digestions.&#xd;
    In the third phase, using the results obtained previously, anaerobic co-digestions with FOG were tested in bench-scale semi-continuous flow digesters at Ravensview Water Pollution Control Plant, Kingston, ON. The effects of hydraulic retention time (HRT), organic loading rate (OLR) and digestion temperature (37°C and 55°C) on biogas production were evaluated. The best biogas production rate of 17.4±0.86 L/d and methane content 67.9±1.46% was obtained with thermophilic (55°C) co-digestion at HRT=24 days and OLR=2.43±0.15 g TVS/L•d. &#xd;
    In the fourth phase, with the suitable co-substrate, optimum pre-treatment method and operational parameters identified from the previous phases, anaerobic co-digestions with FOG were investigated in a two-stage thermophilic semi-continuous flow co-digestion system modified to incorporate thermo-chemical pre-treatment of pH=10 at 55°C. Overall, the modified two-stage co-digestion system yielded a 25.14±2.14 L/d (with 70.2±1.4% CH4) biogas production, which was higher than that obtained in the two-stage system without pre-treatment.&#xd;
    The positive results could provide valuable information and original contribution to justify full-scale investigation in a continuing research program and to the field of research on anaerobic co-digestion of municipal organic wastes.</description>

   <description>As an important structural component in CANDU reactor, the pressure tube, made of coldworked Zr-2.5Nb, experiences a neutron flux under high pressure and elevated temperature during the reactor operation. Notches, existing as defects in the pressure tube, are usually the location where stress concentration and crack initiation happens, which seriously degrade the performance of the pressure tube. However, the concentrated stress at the notch area is expected to be relieved by thermal creep, reducing the possibility of crack occurrence.&#xd;
In this study, synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments were conducted to collect the lattice strains near the notch in both irradiated and unirradiated Zr-2.5Nb samples which had experienced a thermal creep process for different time periods. Strain maps of the notch area were created for each sample. Stress relaxation over the time is discussed for both parallel and perpendicular to the loading direction and also compared between {10 -10} and {0002} orientations. A FE model was set up for the unirradiated materials, which was verified by the experimental results.&#xd;
This work provides an understanding of the stress relaxation near a notch in Zr-2.5Nb and the stress/strain distribution during the thermal creep, which provides valuable information on the assessment of the reactor operation.</description>

   <description>Prior to signal demodulation, blind recognition of the modulation&#xd;
scheme of the received signal is an important task for intelligent&#xd;
radios in various commercial and military applications such as&#xd;
spectrum management, surveillance of broadcasting activities and adaptive&#xd;
transmission. Antenna arrays provide spatial diversity and increase channel&#xd;
capacity. This thesis focuses on the algorithms and performance analysis of&#xd;
the blind modulation classification (MC) for a multiple antenna receiver configuration.&#xd;
&#xd;
For a single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) configuration with unknown channel amplitude, phase, and noise variance, we&#xd;
investigate likelihood-based algorithms for linear digital MC. The existing&#xd;
algorithms are presented and extended to SIMO. Using recently proposed blind estimates of the unknown parameters, a&#xd;
new algorithm is developed. In addition, two upper bounds on the classification performance of MC&#xd;
algorithms are provided. We derive the exact Cramer-Rao Lower Bounds (CRLBs) of joint estimates of the unknown parameters for one- and two-dimensional amplitude modulations. The asymptotic behaviors of the CRLBs are obtained for the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) region. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of the CRLB expressions and confirm that the expressions in the literature are special cases of our results. The classification performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the existing algorithm and upper bounds. It is shown that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing one significantly with reasonable computational complexity.&#xd;
&#xd;
The proposed algorithm in this thesis can be used in modern intelligent radios equipped with multiple antenna receivers&#xd;
and the provided performance analysis, i.e., the CRLB expressions,  can be employed to design practical systems involving estimation of the unknown parameters&#xd;
and is not limited to MC.</description>

   <description>Depression is the most common mental illness worldwide, and although aspects of the social environment, including social capital and neighbourhood disadvantage, have been linked to depression, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Debates within the social capital and neighbourhood disadvantage literatures have yielded mixed findings in studies of depression and an understanding of how social capital may differentially relate to symptomatology in men and women must be solidified. In the first manuscript of this thesis, I assess whether (1) network and psychosocial measures of individual social capital are each associated with depressive symptoms, and (2) the association varies according to whether the capital lies outside or inside an individual’s neighbourhood. The second manuscript investigates whether: (1) neighbourhood disadvantage has a stronger association with depression in women compared to men and (2) if specific social capital factors mediate the association between neighbourhood disadvantage and depression. Data came from the Montreal Neighbourhood Networks and Healthy Aging Study conducted in 2008. Data included telephone interview responses from 2624 adults from 300 census tracts in the Montreal metropolitan area. The CESD-10 instrument was used to assess depressive symptoms. Name and position generator instruments and self-reported questions were used to assess psychosocial and network components of social capital. Multilevel logistic regressions adjusted for a range of socio-demographic and economic characteristics. Manuscript 1 results indicated that core tie diversity as well as the psychosocial measures of generalized trust, trust in neighbours, and perceptions of neighbourhood cohesion may be beneficial to those suffering from depressive symptoms. Manuscript 2 results, stratified by gender, indicated that neighbourhood disadvantage was associated with depressive symptoms in women only and that perceived neighbourhood cohesion mediated this association. Core tie diversity, generalized trust and trust in neighbours were associated with depression in women but did not act as mediating variables. It is suggested that network and psychosocial, as well as general- and neighbourhood specific measures of social capital be included in studies of depressive symptoms. Health promotion initiatives meant to combat depression may wish to consider the gender differences in the design and implementation of neighbourhood or peer-based programs.</description>

   <description>Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen found in soil and aquatic environments that possesses a broad range of intrinsic antibiotic resistance mechanisms, including a highly impermeable outer membrane and several RND-type efflux pumps that export a number of clinically relevant antibiotic classes. Chronic P. aeruginosa infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients gradually develop high levels of resistance to antimicrobial therapy due to conditions that favour the acquisition and selection of numerous chromosomal mutations, the nature of which are poorly understood. To identify chromosomal contributors to aminoglycoside resistance a P. aeruginosa transposon mutant library was screened for increases in aminoglycoside susceptibility. Six genes of interest (pstB, lptA, faoA, amgR, PA0392, and PA2798) were identified, the deletion of which meaningfully decreased aminoglycoside minimum inhibitory concentrations in wild-type P. aeruginosa. Combinations of gene deletions were constructed to determine if any of these genes contributed to aminoglycoside resistance via a common mechanism or whether they operated independently to promote intrinsic aminoglycoside resistance. In all cases, double deletion had an additive impact on aminoglycoside susceptibility, suggesting that each gene of interest contributes to resistance through an independent mechanism. Deletions in pstB, lptA, faoA, amgR, PA0392, and PA2798 were introduced into pan-aminoglycoside-resistant CF-lung isolates where they dramatically compromised aminoglycoside resistance, indicating that these genes also contribute to acquired aminoglycoside resistance in chronic P. aeruginosa infections. A fluorimetric assay was developed to measure aminoglycoside-induced membrane depolarization using the voltage sensitive probe DIBAC4(3). Gentamicin-induced membrane depolarization was found to be substantially increased in the amgR, pstB, and PA0392 mutant strains when compared to wild-type P. aeruginosa. These increases in depolarization paralleled declines in cell viability as measured by a gentamicin killing assay, suggesting that the cytoplasmic membranes of these mutant strains are more sensitive to the membrane perturbing effects of aminoglycoside-induced mistranslated proteins, and supporting a role for the disruption of the selective barrier of the cytoplasmic membrane in the bactericidal activity of the aminoglycosides. This study describes novel contributors to intrinsic and acquired aminoglycoside resistance in P. aeruginosa, and highlights the importance of membrane functions in resisting these activities.</description>

   <description>Older adults who stay physically and mentally active appear to have better cognitive function compared to their less active counterparts.  In fact, those who perform either regular exercise or cognitive training (CT) can maintain and improve their cognitive functioning, even in their later years.  Resistance training (RT) causes an increase in specific hormones that are responsible for improved brain functioning; however, many questions about how these hormones respond to RT are unanswered.  Understanding how these hormones respond to RT can help researchers and clinicians create optimal training programs for older adults.  Research shows that combining exercise and CT may be better for the brain compared to either activity performed alone; however, nobody has looked at RT combined with CT.  We believe that combining RT and CT where CT is performed when an individual’s hormones are highest (right after RT) could have a big effect on brain function in a short period of time.  This work represents a two-part study looked at: 1) how these hormones respond to a session of RT, and 2) the effect of combined RT and CT on cognitive function in older adults.  Our participants performed CT immediately after RT, 3 times per week for 8 weeks.  Specific hormones which are important for brain function were measured immediately before and for 2 hours after an acute bout of RT before and after 8-weeks of RT.  Cognitive function was measured before and after the RT training period.  Our primary findings were: 1) significant increases in brain derived neurotrophic factor immediately after RT and 2) participants cognitive function improved after 8 weeks of training. This is important because short-term combined RT and CT can lead to significant improvements in cognitive functioning.  Also, this work will allow researchers to begin designing exercise programs that can maximize the brain’s ability to change, even at an old age.</description>

   <title>Assessment of the Effects of Habitat, Harvest and Community Interactions on the Abundance of Walleye Sander Vitreus in Inland Lakes Throughout Ontario</title>

   <description>Walleye (Sander vitreus) is an important species to the recreational fishery throughout Ontario.  Fish community interactions between walleye and other species are rarely considered when establishing management targets which may lead to the creation of conflicting management objectives.  Other studies that have focused on competitive interactions between species have typically focused on interactions between two species in isolation of the remaining species within the fish community and considered only a small subset of lakes.  My study examined how the presence/absence of multiple species within the fish community affects the abundance of walleye across a broad spectrum of habitat conditions and fisheries.    A Schaefer model was modified by distinguishing carrying capacity into a habitat and fish community component to account for between lake differences in suitable habitat prior to testing for interactions.  Walleye catch-per-unit effort (CUEW, kg/net) was assessed in 140 Ontario lakes using the Fall Walleye Index Netting Protocol.   An all subsets approach was used to estimate parameters in a multiple regression.  Fish community and fishing pressure were significant predictors in explaining walleye abundance (adjusted R2=0.45, p&lt;0.001).  The presence of bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomeiu) were significant negative predictors in the top model (αbluegill = -1.54, partial r2=0.1; αsmallmouth = -0.28, partial r2=0.03).  In many studies, smallmouth bass have also been found to have a significant diet overlap with walleye.  These interactions present challenges when establishing management objectives for mixed fisheries.</description>

   <description>Field mapping and, structural, microstructural, and chronological analyses confirm the existence of a segment of the Gurla-Mandhata-Humla fault, an orogen-parallel strike-slip dominated shear zone in the upper Karnali valley of northwestern Nepal. This shear zone forms the upper contact of, and cuts obliquely across the Greater Himalayan Sequence (GHS). Data from this study reveal two phases of GHS deformation.&#xd;
Phase 1 is characterized by U-Th-Pb monazite crystallization ages (~26–12 Ma, peak ~18–15 Ma), consistent with typical Neohimalayan metamorphic ages, and the final stages of south-directed extrusion of the GHS. &#xd;
Phase 2 is characterized by south-dipping high-strain foliations and intensely developed ESE-WNW trending, shallowly plunging mineral elongation lineations, indicating orogen-parallel extension. Thermochronology of muscovite defining these fabrics implies that the area was cooling and experiencing orogen-parallel extension by ~15–9 Ma. Mineral deformation mechanisms and quartz c-axis patterns of these fabrics record a rapid increase in temperature from ~350°C along the shear zone, to ~650°C at ~2.5 structural km below the shear zone. Such temperature gradients may be remnants of telescoped and/or flattened isotherms generated during south-directed extrusion of the GHS.&#xd;
Overprinting ESE-WNW fabrics record progressive deformation of the GHS at lower temperatures. Progressive deformation included a significant component of pure shear, as indicated by symmetric high-temperature quartz c-axis fabrics and a lower-temperature vorticity estimate (~59% pure shear). A transition in c-axis fabrics from type I to type II cross-girdles at ~ 1.2 km below the fault could indicate a transition from plane strain towards constriction. Together, these data suggest orogen-parallel extension was occurring as a result of transtension. &#xd;
This study reveals a transition from south-directed extrusion of the GHS to orogen-parallel extension between ~15–13 Ma. Comparing these data with tectonic events across the Himalaya reveals an orogen-wide middle Miocene transition, coeval with the uplift of eastern Tibet. This is consistent with interpretations invoking radial spreading of Tibet and east-directed lower-crustal flow to explain orogen-parallel extension. Our study leads to the suggestion that a transition affecting mid- to lower-crustal processes may be responsible for the cessation of south-directed extrusion of the GHS and onset of east-directed lower-crustal flow.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Mathematics &amp; Statistics) -- Queen's University, 2012-09-24 10:24:22.51</description>
   <description>Controllability and stabilisability are two fundamental properties of control systems and it is intuitively appealing to conjecture that the former should imply the latter; especially so when the state of a control system is assumed to be known at every time instant. Such an implication can, indeed, be proven for certain types of controllability and stabilisability, and certain classes of control systems. In the present thesis, we consider real analytic control systems of the form $\Sgr:\dot{x}=f(x,u)$, with $x$ in a real analytic manifold and $u$ in a separable metric space, and we show that, under mild technical assumptions, small-time local controllability from an equilibrium $p$ of \Sgr\ implies the existence of a piecewise analytic feedback \Fscr\ that asymptotically stabilises \Sgr\ at $p$. As a corollary to this result, we show that nonlinear control systems with controllable unstable dynamics and stable uncontrollable dynamics are feedback stabilisable, extending, thus, a classical result of linear control theory.&#xd;
&#xd;
Next, we modify the proof of the existence of \Fscr\ to show stabilisability of small-time locally controllable systems in finite time, at the expense of obtaining a closed-loop system that may not be Lyapunov stable. Having established stabilisability in finite time, we proceed to prove a converse-Lyapunov theorem. If \Fscr\ is a piecewise analytic feedback that stabilises a small-time locally controllable system \mbox{$\Sgr:\dot{x}=f(x,u)$} in finite time, then the Lyapunov function we construct has the interesting property of being differentiable along every trajectory of the closed-loop system obtained by ``applying" \Fscr\ to \Sgr.&#xd;
&#xd;
We conclude this thesis with a number of open problems related to the stabilisability of nonlinear control systems, along with a number of examples from the literature that hint at potentially fruitful lines of future research in the area.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, I examine the case of the Canadian-based multinational mining corporation GreyStar resources Ltd. in Colombia. Angosturas is GreyStar’s large-scale gold mining project in the sensitive wet highland of páramo de Santurbán in the northeast of the Andes. Although GreyStar has undertaken explorations in this area since 1994, Colombia’s Ministry of Environment denied the environmental license to the company to start with extractions in 2011. I suggest that the government’s decision must be understood in the context of massive mobilizations against the project in large cities such as Bucaramanga and Bogotá as well as the principle of sustainable development (hereafter SD). The latter forms part of the 1991 Colombian constitution, and thus, through this legal presence, is considered to provide environmental protection in the country. Despite this government’s recent ruling, GreyStar (which renamed itself ‘Eco Oro’ after the 2011 decision) and other mining companies (e.g. Ventana Gold) have continued their quest to gain permission to begin with extractions in Santurbán. &#xd;
&#xd;
I explore why these continued attempts to persuade the government regarding extraction licensing is possible. In doing so, I critically investigate the principle of SD, which is central to the resolution by which the Ministry of the Environment denies the environmental license to Eco Oro (GreyStar). In other words, this thesis asks why SD allows for the classification of large-scale mining as a ‘common-good’ activity, which has negative implications on attempts to designate certain ecosystems (e.g. páramo) as common-goods on the basis that there are to be sustained as such, and therefore, an unequivocal moratorium on large-scale mining in these ecosystems is necessary. What and whose common-good does large-scale mining in sensitive ecosystems represent? I argue that in the scope of SD, commoditized nature is vulnerable to the volatility of markets and corporate profitability. This thesis is a criticism of SD and the limitations it places on hearing certain kinds of languages and discourses that resist the key assumptions of SD. The case study allows for addressing a gap in the existing literature, which is the distinctive situation of no legally considered ethnic minorities (e.g. small farmers, small miners, and the cities).</description>

   <description>The aim of this study was to assess the performance of thermal heating for the removal of chlorinated solvents from fractured rock. The study included a laboratory experimental program, a field pilot study demonstration and a mathematical modeling component. In the laboratory experimental program, thermal heating parameters, such as operational temperature, heating duration, and the corresponding degree of contaminant removal, were evaluated through a series of heating tests. To evaluate the effect of heating temperature and heating duration on the degree of contaminant mass removal, two different heating profiles were utilized during the experiments. Additionally, seven types of rock and two common contaminants were selected to evaluate the effect of thermal heating on different geological media impacted with different chlorinated compounds. In general, results showed that heating duration had the most significant effect on the degree of contaminant mass removal in post-remedy samples. Results showed that a higher porosity in combination with a lower organic content facilitates the removal of chlorinated solvents from the rock matrix. A Thermal Conductive Heating (TCH) pilot test was implemented by TerraTherm, Inc. at the former Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC) in West Trenton, NJ to assess the performance of TCH for the removal of trichloroethylene (TCE) and daughter products (i.e cis-1,2-dichloroethylene (DCE) and vinyl chloride (VC))  from fractured bedrock. Results showed that treatment removed 318.5 kg of TCE, DCE and VC, from the treatment zone, of which 62.6 kg were recovered from the rock matrix. A total of 63 % TCE, 65.8 % of DCE and 90.4% of VC were removed during heating. Finally, Semi-analytical solutions were derived to evaluate back diffusion in a fractured bedrock environment where the initial condition comprises a spatially uniform, non-zero matrix concentration throughout the domain. It was concluded that the time required to reach a desired fracture pore water concentration is a function of the distance between the point of compliance and the upgradient face of the domain where clean groundwater is inflowing. Hence, shorter distances correspond to reduced times required to reach compliance.</description>

   <description>For scientists, the accuracy of their results is a constant concern.  As the programs they write to support their research grow in complexity, there is a greater need to understand what causes the inaccuracies in their outputs, and how they can be mitigated.  This problem is difficult because the inaccuracies in the outputs come from a variety of sources in both the scientific and computing domains.  Furthermore, as most programs lack a testing oracle, there is no simple way to validate the results.&#xd;
&#xd;
We define a model for the analysis of error propagation in software.  Its novel combination of interval arithmetic and automatic differentiation allows for the error accumulated in an output to be measurable at runtime, attributable to individual inputs and functions, and identifiable as either input error, round-off error, or error from a different source.  This allows for the identification of the subset of inputs and functions that are most responsible for the error seen in an output and how it can be best mitigated.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model by analyzing a small case study from the field of nuclear engineering, where we are able to attribute the contribution of over 99% of the error to 3 functions out of 15, and identify the causes for the observed error.</description>

   <description>Leaf Area Index (LAI) is an important input variable for forest ecosystem modeling as it is a factor in predicting productivity and biomass, two key aspects of forest health. Current in situ methods of determining LAI are sometimes destructive and generally very time consuming. Other LAI derivation methods, mainly satellite-based in nature, do not provide sufficient spatial resolution or the precision required by forest managers. This thesis focused on estimating LAI from: i) height and density metrics derived from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR); ii) spectral vegetation indices (SVIs), in particular the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); and iii) a combination of these two remote sensing technologies.&#xd;
In situ measurements of LAI were calculated from digital hemispherical photographs (DHPs) and remotely sensed variables were derived from low density LiDAR and high resolution WorldView-2 data. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models were created using these variables, allowing forest-wide prediction surfaces to be created. Results from these analyses demonstrated: i) moderate explanatory power (i.e., R2 = 0.54) for LiDAR models incorporating metrics that have proven to be related to canopy structure; ii) no relationship when using SVIs; and iii) no significant improvement of LiDAR models when combining them with SVI variables. &#xd;
The results suggest that LiDAR models in boreal forest environments provide satisfactory estimations of LAI, even with low ranges of LAI for model calibration. On the other hand, it was anticipated that traditional SVI relationships to LAI would be present with WorldView-2 data, a result that is not easily explained. Models derived from low point density LiDAR in a mixedwood boreal environment seem to offer a reliable method of estimating LAI at a high spatial resolution for decision makers in the forestry community.</description>

   <description>“Despite the fact that memory in people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has been researched for over fifty years, there has been very little in the way of attempts to synthesize or codify the findings” (Boucher &amp; Bowler, 2008, p. xv).  It is the intent of this thesis to address this need specifically for episodic memory function in individuals with autism or Asperger’s syndrome.  A scoping review was conducted on episodic memory function in this population and the findings are used to: (1) produce an episodic memory profile for individuals with autism or Asperger’s syndrome; and (2) identify gaps in the existing literature for future areas of study.  The framework for the search criteria was based on Lind and Bowler’s (2008) claim of development of episodic memory being dependent on three cognitive abilities: (1) concept of self; (2) meta-representation; and (3) temporal cognition.  Implications for teaching practice were discussed in light of the findings.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Mechanical and Materials Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2012-09-24 16:52:28.032</description>
   <description>Transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) steels have excellent strength, ductility and work hardening behaviour, which can be attributed to a phenomenon known as the TRIP effect. The TRIP effect involves a metastable phase, retained austenite (RA), transforming into martensite as a result of applied stress or strain. This transformation absorbs energy and improves the work hardening rate of the steel, delaying the onset of necking.&#xd;
&#xd;
This work describes two distinct TRIP steel microstructures and focuses on how microstructure affects the RA-to-martensite transformation and the uniaxial tensile behaviour. A two-step heat treatment was applied to an aluminum-alloyed TRIP steel to obtain a microstructure consisting of equiaxed grains of ferrite surrounded by bainite, martensite and RA -- the equiaxed microstructure. The second microstructure was produced by first austenitizing and quenching the steel to produce martensite, followed by the two-step heat treatment. The resulting microstructure (labelled the lamellar microstructure) consisted of elongated grains of ferrite with bainite, martensite and RA grains. Both microstructural variants had similar initial volume fractions of RA. A series of interrupted tensile tests and ex-situ magnetic measurements were conducted to examine the RA transformation during uniform elongation. Similar tests were also conducted on an equiaxed microstructure and a  lamellar microstructure with similar ultimate tensile strengths.&#xd;
&#xd;
Results show that the work hardening rate is directly related to the RA transformation rate. The slower transformation rate, or higher RA stability, that was observed in the lamellar microstructure enables sustained work hardening at high strains. In contrast, the equiaxed microstructure has a lower RA stability and thus exhibits high values of work hardening at low strains, but the effect is quickly exhausted. Several microstructural factors that affect RA stability were examined, including RA grain size, aspect ratio, carbon content and spatial distribution of the phases. Two of these factors were characteristic of only the lamellar microstructures and led to higher RA stabilities: elongated RA grains and RA grains being primarily surrounded by bainite. The results were also compared with previous work on a silicon-alloyed TRIP steel to show that the aluminum-alloyed compositions could achieve similar, if not better, combinations of strength and ductility.</description>

   <description>In normal adult physiology, intestinal smooth muscle cells (ISMC) are characterized as contractile and non-proliferative. Inflammation induces permanent changes to the intestine including hypertrophy of the smooth muscle layer largely due to smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation. While the consequences of this hyperplasia are largely unknown, increased muscularis mass may present permanent challenges to organ motility.  Similar SMC hyperplasia is observed in other inflammatory pathologies including atherosclerosis and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) where SMC de-differentiate into a ‘synthetic’ phenotype and the mitogens responsible for hyperplasia have been well studied. However, there are limited investigations of SMC mitogens in intestinal inflammation. The identification of these factors may be of critical importance in the case of intestinal strictures, whereby recurring inflammation can lead to bowel obstruction requiring surgical intervention.  A novel, primary rat ISMC model was developed to identify the factors responsible for ISMC proliferation in vitro. Primary ISMC cultures are likely more representative of SMC in vivo than the commonly used late-passage cultures. As such, this primary ISMC model is valuable in the evaluation of mitogens involved in the onset of proliferation.  This primary ISMC model was used to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of potential mitogens including basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB. This work identified IGF-1 and PDGF-BB as ISMC mitogens. However, multiple lines of evidence indicated that PDGF-BB was a more potent mitogen and the involvement of PDGF-BB was subsequently examined in vivo using the trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) model of rat intestinal inflammation.  While control ISMC lacked expression of the PDGF-BB receptor (PDGF-Rβ), robust expression was observed within only 6 hr following the induction of TNBS inflammation. By Day 2, when ISMC proliferation in vivo is maximal, freshly isolated ISMC showed on-going PDGF-Rβ activation that was further increased by exogenous PDGF-BB.  Taken together, the conclusions from this work in vitro identify PDGF-BB as a potent ISMC mitogen in vivo. Further, this work establishes PDGF-BB and its receptor as potential targets in the medical treatment of intestinal stricture formation.</description>

   <description>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revolutionized the field of cognitive neuroscience as it allows researchers to noninvasively map brain function in response to stimulus or task demands. However, the acquisition of MR images generates substantial acoustic noise, so that imaging studies of speech, language and hearing are problematic. &#xd;
&#xd;
One proven solution for reducing acoustic noise in MRI scanners is the use of micro-perforated panels placed in the bore of the scanner.  They can be applied to existing scanners with minimal cost and are suitable for sterile environments.  Although these panels result in quantifiably lower noise levels, measured with microphones in an empty MRI, the improvement has not been quantified with a patient in the scanner bore, which dramatically affects the acoustic noise field.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis tested the reduction of noise inside the MRI environment using a previously designed micro-perforated acoustic absorber panel.  These panels resulted in quantifiably lower noise levels with a volunteer in the scanner bore, however the reduction was not sufficient for significant differences in volunteer perceptions. Volunteers were generally unable to perceive a difference in noise between scans with and without absorbers and no reduction of fatigue was observed.  Also no significant change in cortical activity was found between scans done with and without absorbers during an auditory function MRI study.  Further testing could include designing a micro-perforated acoustic absorber for a specific scan sequence for maximum attenuation.</description>

   <description>Providing opportunities for outdoor recreation and maintaining ecological integrity are primary management objectives for protected spaces in the public domain, but as visitation and visitor expectations change, a balance must be maintained between environmental and visitor use that is consistent with management goals.&#xd;
There is an increasing dependence on public participation in protected area management to compensate for an increasing budgetary gap between desired and actual management states. The Investigator explores how science, public perception, and collaborative relationships with stakeholders influence management planning and what the effect has been on management action. How has that balance between visitor use and environmental preservation objectives been affected?&#xd;
Three case study sites were selected in eastern Ontario: a national park, a provincial park, and a municipal forest. For each site, semi-structured interviews with staff and stakeholders were conducted, guiding legislation and supporting documents were analysed, and site observational evidence was collected. The data was analyzed using methodological triangulation and McCracken’s (1988) four-part method of inquiry.&#xd;
The results identified each site’s management goals and the management planning and action utilized to achieve those goals. The integration of environmental science and the role of public perception and participation are described as well as the nature of the management response. The discussion identifies management trends across the three governmental levels, characterising how ecological integrity and visitor use are managed, the impact of funding on management action, and the role and influence stakeholders have achieved at each site.&#xd;
Findings revealed trends from federal to municipal governance, principally: i) operational funding decreases; ii) the influence and dependence on public participation and stakeholder collaboration increases; iii) the importance of environmental preservation objectives decrease while ‘use’ associated objectives increase. Critically however, it was observed that when funding levels are below the threshold required to comply with stated management goals, protected area management becomes more reactive and tends to favour ‘use’ related objectives over environmental preservation objectives despite land managers’ best intentions.</description>

   <description>This dissertation demonstrates new methods for increasing the performance and scalability of high performance networking technologies for use in clustered computing systems, concentrating on Ethernet/High-Speed networking convergence.  The motivation behind the improvement of high performance networking technologies and their importance to the viability of modern data centers is discussed first.  It then introduces the concepts of high performance networking in a commercial data center context as well as high performance computing (HPC) and describes some of the most important challenges facing such networks in the future. It reviews current relevant literature and discusses problems that are not yet solved.  &#xd;
Through a study of existing high performance networks, the most promising features for future networks are identified.  Sockets Direct Protocol (SDP) is shown to have unexpected performance issues for commercial applications, due to inefficiencies in handling large numbers of simultaneous connections.  The first SDP over eXtended Reliable Connections implementation is developed to reduce connection management overhead, demonstrating that performance issues are related to protocol overhead at the SDP level.  Datagram offloading for IP over InfiniBand (IPoIB) is found to work well.&#xd;
In the first work of its kind, hybrid high-speed/Ethernet networks are shown to resolve the issues of SDP underperformance and demonstrate the potential for hybrid high-speed networking local area Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) technologies and Ethernet wide area networking for data centers. &#xd;
Given the promising results from these studies, a set of solutions to enhance performance at the local and wide area network level for Ethernet is introduced, providing a scalable, connectionless, socket-compatible, fully RDMA-capable networking technology, datagram-iWARP.  A novel method of performing RDMA Write operations (called RDMA Write-Record) and RDMA Read over unreliable datagrams over Ethernet is designed, implemented and tested.  It shows its applicability in scientific and commercial application spaces and is applicable to other verbs-based networking interfaces such as InfiniBand.  &#xd;
The newly proposed RDMA methods, both for send/recv and RDMA Write-Record, are supplemented with interfaces for both socket-based applications and Message Passing Interface (MPI) applications.  An MPI implementation is adapted to support datagram-iWARP. Both scalability and performance improvements are demonstrated for HPC and commercial applications.</description>

   <description>Abstract&#xd;
Women are usually represented as victims in the literature on conflict and conflict resolution. While women are indeed victims of violence in the context of conflict, this representation excludes the experiences of women who have joined and fought in illegal armed groups. Little is known about the lives of women who fight alongside men in illegal militarized organizations. These women are often overlooked during peace negotiations and in the design and implementation of Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration programs, affecting their conditions and experiences during the transition to civilian life. The Colombian conflict presents an important case study regarding the militarization of women in illegal armed groups, and the experience of demobilization, and is the focus of this dissertation. To address this case study, the concept of “militarized gender performativity” is advanced, drawing on the works of Cynthia Enloe and Judith Butler. In the Colombian case, both left–wing and right–wing armed groups have incorporated women into their ranks. This research elucidates the effects of non–state militarism on the social processes that produce and reproduce gender systems in two of Colombia’s illegal armed groups, uncovering how the FARC and the AUC construct, negotiate, challenge, or reinforce gender roles.  The research indicates that there are significant differences in the way this is done. Interviews with ex–combatants from the FARC and the AUC show that women’s sexuality plays a central role in the militarization of women combatants in both organizations, but there are specific policies that establish the nature of the relationships in each group. These differences represent distinct militarized femininities which maintain aspects of traditional gender relations while transforming others according to the needs of the organization in question. The transformation of gender identities in each of the armed groups reveals the performative nature of gender roles in a militarized context.</description>

   <title>The Progress of Discipline: An Examination of Safe Schools Policies in Ontario's Education System (1999-2011), From the Politics of Exclusion to the Conditions of Inclusion</title>

   <description>In 2001 the Progressive Conservative government led by Mike Harris (1995-2002) implemented an authoritative discipline regime in Ontario schools that epitomized the law and order values of contemporary neoconservative rule in the Canadian context. Central to the character of this regime was the enforcement of safe schools through the exclusion and punishment of some of the most vulnerable students. In 2005, the Ontario Human Rights Commission initiated a complaint against the Ministry of Education, alleging that the discipline policies were disproportionately and adversely affecting racialized students and students with disabilities. In response, in 2007 the Liberal government led by Dalton McGuinty (2002 - present) introduced what it called progressive discipline policies. These policies reflect therapeutic values of early intervention and support, offering incentives for students to remain actively involved and engaged with the school community. This shift, from an authoritative to a progressive mode of discipline, is less an indication of a successful political effort to implement equitable discipline policies in education; instead, it is more an indication of the repositioning of these policies within neoliberal relations of power. I argue that progressive discipline policies do little more than change the forms through which marginalization and exclusion are carried out in Ontario schools.</description>

   <description>Migratory birds face the distinct challenge of travelling between widely separated and environmentally distinct areas for their breeding and non-breeding periods. They may be faced with different pressures at different points in their life cycle, and a solid understanding of the drivers of individual fitness and population demography is crucial to understanding the ecological and evolutionary trajectories of their populations. In this thesis, I combine long-term data and experimental manipulations to study migratory patterns and arrival dynamics, density dependence, and reproductive behaviour in a long-distance migratory bird, the American redstart.&#xd;
First, I show that non-breeding season weather is associated with redstart phenology on the breeding grounds. Greater winter rainfall corresponds to earlier arrival and egg-laying dates at both the population and individual level, indicating that individual birds may be able to adjust their phenology in response to conditions in winter. Furthermore, I demonstrate these associations independently at two breeding populations at opposite sides of the redstart breeding range and their corresponding putative non-breeding areas: greater rainfall in Jamaica and Mexico was associated with advanced redstart phenology in Ontario and Alberta, respectively. Second, I performed a manipulation experiment to delay the arrival of male redstarts to the breeding grounds. I show that delayed males suffer reduced fledging success in comparison to early-arriving males that bred early or late, but equivalent success in comparison to males that arrived and bred late. These results provide evidence against the importance of either timing or individual quality, but instead suggest that other aspects of quality, namely mate and territory quality, may be important factors driving the success of early-arriving males. Third, I examine the consequences of density dependence for reproductive success and mating behaviour in a population of redstarts for which I showed density-dependent population growth over a period of 11 years. Greater breeding density, both at an annual scale and at a local scale, was associated with reduced success and greater paternity loss. Overall, my findings contribute to a broader understanding of the selective pressures and regulatory mechanisms acting on migratory birds, from the individual up to the population level.</description>

   <description>High-speed particle dispersion research is motivated by the energy release enhancement of explosives containing solid particles.  In the initial explosive dispersal, a dense gas-solid flow can exist where the physics of phase interactions are not well understood. A dense particle flow is generated by the interaction of a shock wave with an initially stationary packed granular bed. The initial packed granular bed is produced by compressing loose aluminum oxide powder into a 6.35 mm thick wafer with a particle volume fraction of 0.48. The wafer is positioned inside the shock tube, uniformly filling the entire cross-section. This results in a clean experiment where no flow obstructing support structures are present. Through high-speed shadowgraph imaging and pressure measurements along the length of the channel, detailed information about the particle-shock interaction was obtained. Due to the limited strength of the Mach 2 incident shock wave, no transmitted shock wave is produced. The initial “solid-like” response of the particle wafer acceleration forms a series of compression waves that coalesce to form a shock wave. Breakup is initiated along the periphery of the wafer as the result of shear that forms due to the fixed boundary condition. Particle break-up starts at local failure sites that result in the formation of particle jets that extend ahead of the accelerating, largely intact, wafer core. In a circular tube the failure sites are uniformly distributed along the wafer circumference. In a square channel, the failure sites, and the subsequent particle jets, initially form at the corners due to the enhanced shear. The wafer breakup subsequently spreads to the edges forming a highly non-uniform particle cloud.</description>

   <description>The exhibition “Terrance Houle &amp; Adrian Stimson: Exploring Indigenous Masculinities” showcased the performance art of Terrance Houle (Blood/Ojibway) and Adrian Stimson (Siksika) at the Union Gallery in Kingston, Ontario from March 20th to March 22nd, 2012. Both artists used the occasion to interrogate how Indigenous identities are constructed and perceived. The artists’ interaction with the audience and the space of the gallery itself acted to destabilize lingering colonial beliefs about Indigenous identity. This thesis explores how the Kingston performances investigate the historical construction of Indigenous masculine identities. Through the artists’ own embodiment of historical knowledge (both colonial and Indigenous knowledges) and their interaction with the audience and gallery space, the performances challenged and reimagined colonial perceptions of Indigenous masculine identity as a singular, static form. The performances served to translate alternative knowledges about Indigenous men and models of Indigenous masculinity, a dynamic I analyze in this thesis as a larger set of tactics and effects available to artists decolonizing Indigenous masculinities.</description>

   <description>Dissolving multicomponent NAPL as a source of contamination in subsurface water is considered. In particular, two processes are analyzed with regard to how they alter inter-species concentration ratios at remote monitoring locations relative to inter-species molar ratios in the NAPL: nonlinear dissolution governed by Raoult’s Law and differential sorption during subsurface transport. An analytic solution for Raoult’s Law-governed dissolution is presented. Separately, it is shown how a variety of 1D analytic transport models for simple boundary conditions may be adapted to use arbitrary time-varying concentrations by use of some properties of Laguerre series. This is combined with the analytic solution so that Raoult’s Law-governed multicomponent NAPL dissolution may be employed as the boundary condition for analytic transport models. A new computer model implementing this technique in an environment of discrete, parallel fractures is presented, and its accuracy verified for specific conditions against an existing code. The new code is applied to a parametric study on the plume separation of PAH and phenolic compounds from the dissolution of creosote. Narrow fracture spacing as well as significant values of matrix organic carbon are seen as particularly conducive to separation of these types of plumes, which in some circumstances may be entirely disjoint. Concentration ratios downgradient are shown largely unrelated to concentration ratios at the source. Finally, a study of PCB speciation is undertaken in fractured rock with known parameters, for which a rigorous, least squares speciation approach is developed. Even at distances of 5 m from the source, given perfect information about the subsurface, it is found not possible to chemically fingerprint a source PCB mixture from a list of three absent a model of the weathering of the NAPL. Both the PCB and creosote studies demonstrate that forensic inference of source compositions from field data is unreliable and the need for coupled dissolution and transport models like the one developed here.</description>

   <description>The lateral septum is heavily implicated in anxiety regulation, with lesions or&#xd;
pharmacological inhibition of this region suppressing rats' defensive responses in various rat models of anxiety. My first objective was to explore the functional relationship between the lateral septum and its major afferent structure, the ventral hippocampus. Although these structures are extensively connected, it was not clear if they work in concert to regulate anxiety-like behaviours. This idea was tested using a pharmacological disconnection technique, whereby communication between these two structures was disabled by infusing the GABAA agonist muscimol into one side of the lateral septum and the contralateral side of the ventral&#xd;
hippocampus. Increases in open-arm exploration were evident when muscimol was co-infused into one side of the lateral septum and the contralateral ventral hippocampus. By contrast, open arm exploration was not altered when muscimol was co-infused into one side of the lateral&#xd;
septum and the ipsilateral ventral hippocampus. These results support the contention that the ventral hippocampus and the lateral septum regulate rats' open arm exploration in a serial fashion, and that this involves ipsilateral projections from the former to the latter site.&#xd;
My second objective was to further characterize the neuropharmacological aspects of lateral septal regulation of behavioural defence. The lateral septum contains high levels of NPY Y1 and Y2 receptor binding sites in the brain, yet little is known about their contribution in anxiety regulation at this site. Therefore, the second aim of my thesis was to characterize the contribution of NPY and its Y1 and Y2 receptor subtypes in the lateral septal regulation of anxiety in the elevated plus maze, novelty-induced suppression of feeding, and shock-probe burying tests. I determined that distinct NPY receptors differentially contribute to NPY-mediated anxiolysis in a test specific manner, with the Y1 receptor mediating NPY-induced anxiolysis in the novelty-induced suppression of feeding test, and the Y2 receptor mediating NPY13-36-induced anxiolysis in the plus-maze test. Taken together, the results from these studies reinforce the view that the regulation of anxiety involves a variety of different, yet overlapping neural processes.</description>

   <description>Shallow excavations through variable rockmasses in urban centers present significant design challenges, whether considering small diameter tunnels for utilities or large span underground caverns. In designing shallow excavations in urban environs, it is especially critical to minimize the impact of the excavation on surface. &#xd;
	In small diameter projects, minimal surface disturbance is often achieved by the employment of TBMs as the excavation method. While reducing the risk of surface subsidence due to displacements in front of the face, TBM progress is sensitive to variable ground conditions and the TBM design must be appropriately matched to the expected geology. Sufficient understanding of the geology and development of geological models are critical in the selection of an appropriate TBM and cutting tools. In this study, recent projects in Calgary, AB are used to highlight the challenges faced with using TBMs through sedimentary rock with distinct, variable units.&#xd;
	In larger scale projects, long term excavation stability is critical in the reduction of surface disturbance.  Due to the low confining stresses, structural failure is often the primary failure mode in shallow excavations, especially within fractured, heterogeneous rockmasses. In these cases, numerical methods are often used in excavation design. The ability of numerical methods to capture the expected failure modes of shallow excavations through layered rockmasses is explored, with an emphasis placed on the ability of support elements to reduce shear slip for increased stability. Passive bolt models are analysed using both 2D and 3D numerical models to adequately capture the behaviour of a passive support system in shear. The shortcomings of some current support models are discussed, and modifications are suggested.</description>

   <description>Depending on the role of software in everyday life, the cost of a software failure can sometimes be unaffordable. During system execution, errors may occur in system components and failures may be manifested due to these errors. These errors differ with respect to their effects on system behavior and consequent failure manifestation manners. Predicting failures before their manifestation is important to assure system resilience. It helps avoid the cost of failures and enables systems to perform corrective actions prior to failure occurrences. However, effective runtime error detection and failure prediction techniques encounter a prohibitive challenge with respect to the control flow representation of large software systems with intricate control flow structures. In this thesis, we provide a technique for failure prediction from runtime errors of large software systems. Aiming to avoid the possible difficulties and inaccuracies of the existing Control Flow Graph (CFG) structures, we first propose a Connection Dependence Graph (CDG) for control flow representation of large software systems. We describe the CDG structure and explain how to derive it from program source code. Second, we utilize the proposed CDG to provide a connection-based signature approach for control flow error detection. We describe the monitor structure and present the error checking algorithm. Finally, we utilize the detected errors and erroneous state parameters to predict failure occurrences and modes during system runtime. We craft runtime signatures based on these errors and state parameters. Using system error and failure history, we determine a predictive function (an estimator) for each failure mode based on these signatures. Our experimental evaluation for these techniques uses a large open-source software (PostgreSQL 8.4.4 database system). The results show highly efficient control flow representation, error detection, and failure prediction techniques. This work contributes to software reliability by providing a simple and accurate control flow representation and utilizing it to detect runtime errors and predict failure occurrences and modes with high accuracy.</description>

   <description>Articular cartilage accrual occurs predominantly during childhood and adolescence, with the magnitude, direction, and pattern of internal joint loads directing the cartilage growth. If any of these factors of the joint loading are abnormal, it can predispose these children to degenerative knee joint disease as an adult. To provide an estimate of the internal joint loads, a paediatric-focused, static optimization-based lower limb model was developed, compared to recorded sEMG, and analyzed for sensitivity to changes in ground reaction force and muscle attachment site.&#xd;
&#xd;
The model was found to provide consistent predictions of joint contact force predictions ranging from 0.01 to 0.35xBW with standard error of 8% to 17%, with the exception of left knee medial-lateral shear at 108%. Muscle force predictions related well to sEMG, with the standard error ranging from 14% to 36%, except for gastrocnemius lateral at 104%. The model was sensitive to variations in the ground reaction force vector, with a maximum deviation of 0.11 xBW determined as a result of a ±5% variation in GRF.&#xd;
&#xd;
The model was found to be sensitive to clinically relevant deviations in muscle attachment site. Maximum knee anterior shear was significantly changed (p &lt; 0.05) with a 1cm posterior quadriceps insertion deviation, maximum lateral shear with a posterior semimembranosus deviation, and maximum medial shear with a posterior or medial quadriceps deviation. No deviations caused statistically significant changes in compression. Statistically significant change in joint contact force could not be predicted based on changes in muscle moment arm, but could be indirectly predicted by the predicted muscle forces. &#xd;
&#xd;
The model’s uniform convergence and sensitivity to variations in input indicate that the model is sufficiently reliable and robust. This sensitivity suggests that the model is capable of adapting to altered loading conditions and musculoskeletal geometry, either due to deformity or corrective procedure. The model was therefore deemed to be a strong platform for developing clinically specific models for analyzing internal knee loads in a diverse paediatric population.</description>

   <description>Although we have developed modes of governance of religious diversity to accommodate the weak level of religious pluralism which characterized Western societies until recently, it is not clear that these modes of governance can meet the challenges raised by the new and deeper form of religious diversity characterized by a growing gap between the self-understandings of religious and secular citizens as well as by an increasing number of religious groups due to contemporary patterns of immigration. &#xd;
	Freedom of conscience and equality between the adherents of different churches have historically been secured by a separation between state and religion. However, contemporary political theorists disagree about the shape that this separation should take. Some defend a model of institutional pluralism which requires the state to equally support and recognize different religious groups by providing them with the means to set up their own pervasively religious social institutions. Others put forth a restrictive secularist model according to which religion should be privatized. There should be a strict separation between the public and the religious spheres to ensure that no religion is privileged or disadvantaged by the state. &#xd;
However, I argue that both approaches fail to meet the challenges raised by the arrival of new religious minorities within Western societies. Accommodation of religious diversity through separate institutions is not required by equality and freedom of conscience. Moreover, since it favours institutional segmentation along religious lines, it fails to provide favourable conditions for the integration of new immigrant groups. Strict secularism requires that religious expressions be severely restricted in the public sphere and thus heavily limit freedom of conscience. Moreover, since the public sphere is never fully neutral, strict secularism fails to equally protect the freedom of new religious groups.  &#xd;
How can we then achieve the two apparently irreconcilable goals of integrating new minorities and of protecting their freedom and equal status? The thesis that I defend is that these goals can be reconciled by an approach of open secularism based on the reasonable accommodation of religious diversity within shared public institutions.</description>

   <description>Introduction: The Family Health Team (FHT) is an Ontario-based initiative that aims to provide primary care through multidisciplinary teams of healthcare professionals.  Little is known about variability between and within teams, and whether certain organizational characteristics are associated with quality of patient care.  Objectives: (1) To describe FHT-level organizational characteristics for seven FHTs in Southeastern Ontario. (2) To examine the role of physician-level organizational characteristics in predicting: (a) Up-to-date colorectal cancer screening and (b) episodic patient-centredness for patients within seven FHTs in Southeastern Ontario. Methods: This study employed linked datasets obtained from surveys of seven FHTs, 115 health care providers (including 41 family physicians) and 998 patients, as well as a chart abstraction.  Statistical analyses included performing subject-specific multilevel multivariate modeling.  Results: (1) FHTs varied on characteristics including length of time of practice operation, number of patients, existence of personnel policies, team makeup and team climate. (2) (a) Patient uptake of colorectal cancer screening was associated with average duration of regular routine visit OR=0.88 per minute (95% CI 0.83-0.94), patient gender male OR=2.00 (95% CI 1.22-3.28), general checkup in past 2 years OR=9.03 (95% CI 5.18-15.73), travel time less than or equal to 20 minutes OR=1.53 (95% CI 0.94-2.48), and usually see regular provider OR=0.40 (95% CI 0.19–0.87).  Patient uptake or physician recommendation of colorectal cancer screening demonstrated similar associations, with the absence of travel time and the addition of team climate (family physician and nurses) OR=5.88 (95% CI 0.98-35.24), patient occupational status employed vs. retired OR=0.49 (95% CI 0.23–1.02), patient occupational status not employed vs. retired OR=0.42 (95% CI 0.16–1.13), and patient smoking status never vs. ever OR=0.59 (95% CI 0.37–0.96). (b) Episodic patient-centredness was associated with patient born in Canada 0.1119 (95% CI -0.0040-0.2278), seeing regular healthcare provider today 0.1449 (95% CI 0.0426-0.2472), physician-patient gender concordance 0.1019 (95% CI 0.0128-0.1910), and appointment length 0.006929 (95% CI 0.003554-0.010304). Discussion: Further research is needed to examine predictors of the quality of patient care at the practice, physician and patient levels.</description>

   <description>Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) have been used as stem cell markers in a variety of tissues, including the breast. However, it is currently unknown whether ALDH family members participate in normal mammary development or breast cancer. In this study, we set out to elucidate a role for one such protein, ALDH1A3, in mammary luminal cell differentiation and tumorigenesis. We have identified three ALDH1A3 splice variants in breast cell lines, raising the question of whether alternative splicing contributes to cancer development by altering ALDH1A3 activity. We also observed impaired cell motility and defective differentiation in normal breast cell lines cultured in the presence of diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB), a general inhibitor of ALDH activity, suggesting that certain ALDH family members are important for these processes. Based on preliminary in vitro experiments monitoring morphology of breast cell line acini formation and differentiation, doxycyclin-inducible lentiviral TRIPZ-shALDH1A3 pools did not show any obvious defects in differentiation. In addition to this finding, ALDH1A3 mRNA expression levels in primary breast tumour samples (n=39) did not significantly correlate with age, histological grade or hormone receptor status (p-value>0.05). Overall, the results of this study suggest that while ALDH1A3 itself may not be directly involved in breast morphogenesis or cancer formation, other ALDH family members function to facilitate differentiation and cell motility, processes which are important both for normal mammary gland development as well as cancer progression and metastasis.</description>

   <description>Model driven development (MDD) is on the rise in software engineering and no more so than in the realm of real-time and embedded systems. Being able to leverage the code generation and validation techniques made available through MDD is worth exploring, and is the focus of much academic and industrial research. However given the iterative nature of MDD, the natural evolution of models causes test case generation to occur multiple times throughout a software modeling project. Currently, the existing process of regenerating test cases for a modified model of a system can be costly, inefficient, and even redundant.&#xd;
The focus of this research was to achieve an improved understanding of the impact of typical model evolution steps on both the execution of the model and its test cases, and how this impact can be mitigated by reusing previously generated test cases.&#xd;
In this thesis we use existing techniques for symbolic execution and test case generation to perform an analysis on example models and determine how evolution affects model artifacts; these findings were then used to classify evolution steps based on their impact. From these classifications, we were able to determine exactly how to perform updates to existing symbolic execution trees and test suites in order to obtain the resulting test suites using minimal computational resources whenever possible.&#xd;
The approach was implemented in a software plugin, IncreTesCaGen, that is capable of incrementally generating test cases for a subset of UML-RT models by leveraging the existing testing artifacts (symbolic execution trees and test suites), as well as presenting additional analysis results to the user.&#xd;
Finally, we present the results of an initial evaluation of our tool, which provides insight into the tool’s performance, the effects of model evolution on execution and test case generation, as well as design tips to produce optimal models for evolution.</description>

   <description>Decadal changes in the surface area of small ponds in the Kluane region, Yukon were quantified from remote sensing and dendrochronological techniques. Both dead and live shrubs from the genus Salix were sampled and cross-dated from a total of 28 pond ecotones in two different study areas. The rate of ecotone shrub colonization was calculated for each pond by determining the minimum age of Salix spp. in ten zones extending from forest edge to shoreline. Changes in the surface area of 20 ponds in each study area, for a total of 40 ponds, since 1948 were measured using multi-temporal remote sensing analysis. Measured changes were then validated using colonization rates derived from the dendrochronological analysis. Results were compared with meteorological records to elucidate the&#xd;
connection between climate change and shoreline dynamics. Ponds experiencing similar rates of ecotone colonization exhibited similar changes in shoreline&#xd;
position over the last 60 years. Ponds measured with remote sensing showed an overall decline in surface area since 1948; however, direction and extent of change varied within and between the two&#xd;
study areas. Colonization rates also varied within and between study areas. This corresponded to differences in pond ecotone population structure as well as relative extent and direction of changes in surface area, and supported the changes observed in the low-resolution remote sensing time series data. Changes in ponds tended to correspond to increases in annual temperatures which, when combined with a longer growing season and stable precipitation, may have accelerated evaporation potential causing ponds to decrease. The negative consequences of surface area decline are exacerbated by the potential increases in evapotranspiration and the much less extensive wetland system in southwest Yukon relative to other regions in the North. The successful implementation of&#xd;
remote sensing and dendrochronological techniques has value for remote areas that are sensitive to climate change, yet lack direct measurement of changing environmental conditions.</description>

   <description>Biennials, both historically and in the present, form a significant part of the contemporary art world. However, beyond simply acting as platforms for contemporary art, these extensive, recurring international exhibitions also facilitate complex dialogues involving a variety of agents, both cultural and political. With the inherently political nature of these exhibitions in mind, this thesis examines Canadian participation in the Venice and São Paulo biennials from 1951 to 1958. By examining what I identify as the triple purpose of the biennial - the exhibition of contemporary art, the facilitation of cultural diplomacy, and the creation and reinforcement of cultural nationalist narratives - this paper further explicates the National Gallery of Canada’s role in defining Canadian culture and the relationships between visual culture, cultural nationalism, cultural diplomacy and institutional politics in the postwar era. &#xd;
Drawing upon Judith Balfe’s conception of the utilization and manipulation of visual culture for nationalistic or diplomatic ends, I argue that participation in the Venice Biennale served as a means of reinforcing the presence of an NGC-defined culture of Canadian art to an international audience comprised mainly of artistic and diplomatic elite. Conversely, participation in the São Paulo Bienal served primarily as a conduit for the Department of External Affairs to project a positive image of Canadian culture to other nations and foster cordial relations between like-minded nations. I contend that a comparative analysis of Canadian participation in the two biennials highlights the complicated relationship between the NGC and the Department of External Affairs as well as the ideological adherence of both institutions towards liberalism and liberal democracy.</description>

   <description>The effects of climate change along with shifts in social demands have opened up commercial possibilities for new and innovative green technology. At the head of this trend is research into new technologies for Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) and Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs). These technologies would provide for more environmentally friendly transportation; however their current performance when compared to Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) Vehicles has led to slow adoption rates. One of the key factors that could help to increase the performance of HEVs and BEVs lies in improvement of the battery systems. Through proper thermal management of the batteries the range and performance of these vehicles can be improved, helping to increase the performance of the vehicles.&#xd;
This study looks at improving the thermal management of the battery system by generating more efficient cooling plates. These cooling plates are set between battery cells and contain channels that coolant is pumped through. Through optimization of these cooling channels, the efficiency of the cooling plates with regards to the average temperature and standard deviation of temperature of the battery cell can both be increased. The power required to run the cooling system can also be reduced by reducing the pressure losses associated with the cooling plate.&#xd;
Numerical optimization on three models of cooling plates was performed. The models were based on multi-inlet and outlet curved channel systems, with one model constructed using arcs and the other two using 90 degree angles. Results showed that improvements of up to 80% could be made depending on the objective functions when compared to an initial design through optimization, with straight channels providing 8% more efficient designs in terms of pressure losses over curved designs, and curved designs providing 6% more efficient designs in terms of average temperature. Analysis on the effects of varying the mass flow rate, heat flux and inlet temperature was also conducted to evaluate their effects on the optimized geometries.&#xd;
This study has practical applications in helping to develop new cooling plates for commercial use through implementation of the generated design features and optimization algorithms.</description>

   <description>Graduate students' teaching contributes to undergraduate education throughout North America (Park, 2004), the United Kingdom (Muzaka, 2009), Australia (Kift, 2003), and New Zealand (Barrington, 2001), particularly in first-year courses. Mandatory and voluntary training programs, courses, workshops, and certificate programs have been implemented centrally (Mintz, 1998) and departmentally (Ronkowski, 1998) to develop graduate students’ knowledge and skills and improve their teaching. Research assessing outcomes of these programs indicates improvements in individuals’ conceptions about teaching (Saroyan, Dagenais, &amp; Zhou, 2009), but limited impact on practice (Buehler &amp; Marcum, 2007). A potential explanation for this discrepancy is that current individual-focused support for graduate students is not sufficient; rather, teaching and teaching development are influenced by local disciplinary and institutional culture (Taylor, 2010; Trowler &amp; Bamber, 2005). Literature on graduate studies completion further indicates the role of informal supports in graduate students’ academic success (e.g., Lovitts, 2004). This mixed-method research sought to widen the traditional research focus regarding support for graduate students’ scholarly teaching by examining: (1) how support is characterized and described in official visioning documents, policies, and websites at a single institution; (2) how graduate students at this institution generally viewed department and institution-wide supports listed on past surveys, and (3) how current graduate students and supportive individuals from the same institution described available and desired supports. Four themes emerged during analysis of the survey and interview data: formal support, informal support, communication/collaboration, and feedback. These themes were sometimes echoed and sometimes absent in the official documents and existing literature on graduate students’ teaching, which primarily focused on formal supports. Throughout this research, support was explored within the contextual reality in which graduate students learned and taught by examining the sources of such support across the social ecological layers of sector, institution, department, courses, faculty members, peers, and the individual. By broadening the conceptualization of support beyond formal programming, a single social ecological layer, a small group of official support providers, or a one-time event, this study expands both the depth and breadth of possibilities for resource planning within institutions, and future research on teaching supports and graduate student experiences.</description>

   <description>Epidemiological studies have identified psychological stress as a significant risk factor in breast cancer. The stress response is regulated by the HPA axis in the brain and is mediated by glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signalling. It has been found that early life events can affect epigenetic programming of GR, and methylation of the GR promoter has been reported in colorectal tumourigenesis. Decreased GR expression has also been observed in breast cancer. In addition, it has been previously demonstrated that unliganded GR can serve as a direct activator of the BRCA1 promoter in mammary epithelial cells. We propose a model whereby methylation of the GR promoter in the breast significantly lowers GR expression, resulting in insufficient BRCA1 promoter activation and an increased risk of developing cancer. Antibody-based methylated DNA enrichment was followed by qPCR analysis (MeDIP-qPCR) in a novel assay developed to detect locus-specific methylation levels. It was found that 13% of primary breast tumours were hypermethylated at the GR proximal promoter whereas no methylation was detected in normal tissue. RT-PCR and 5’ RACE analysis identified exon 1B as the predominant alternative first exon in the breast. Tumours methylated near exon 1B had decreased GR expression compared to unmethylated samples, suggesting that this region is important for transcriptional regulation of GR. It was also determined that GR and BRCA1 expression was decreased in breast tumour compared to normal tissue. Furthermore, the relative expression of GR and BRCA1 measured by qRT-PCR was correlated in normal tissue but this association was not found in tumour tissue. From this, it appears that lower GR levels with associated decreased BRCA1 expression in tissues may be a predisposing factor for breast cancer. Based on these results we propose a role for GR as a potential tumour suppressor gene in the breast due to its association with BRCA1, also a tumour suppressor gene, as well as its consistently decreased expression in breast tumours and methylation of its proximal promoter in a subset of cancer patients.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Community Health &amp; Epidemiology) -- Queen's University, 2012-09-26 20:59:40.209</description>
   <description>Background: Shift work has recently been identified as a breast cancer risk factor, where meta-analysis has indicated an approximately 50% increased risk among long-term shift workers. However, additional studies with more comprehensive methods of shift work exposure assessment are needed to capture the diversity of shift patterns. The hypothesized mechanism for this relationship involves chronodisruption (altered circadian rhythms), where increased exposure to light at night during night shifts may decrease production of the cancer-protective hormone melatonin. Further, coordination of circadian rhythms, including melatonin production, is governed by the interactions of a set of central clock genes. Recent studies have suggested that variants in clock genes are associated with cancer risk at multiple sites, including breast cancer, although few studies have considered potential interactions with shift work. &#xd;
&#xd;
Methods: This thesis examined relationships of both shift work and clock gene polymorphisms (and their interactions) with breast cancer risk in a case-control study of 1,142 cases and 1,178 controls. The association between light exposure and melatonin production was also investigated in a longitudinal biomarker study conducted among 123 nurses working a two-day, two-night rotating shift pattern. &#xd;
&#xd;
Results: In the case-control study, an association between breast cancer and ≥30 years of shift work (OR = 2.20, 95%CI = 1.13 – 4.28) was detected, although no relationship with short (0 – 14 years) or medium (15 – 29 years) term shift work was observed. As well, variants in 14 clock-related genes were not associated with breast cancer and there were no apparent interactions with shift work history. In the biomarker study, both peak melatonin levels and daily change in melatonin levels were similar when nurses were working their day and night shifts. Further, on the night shift, a slight inverse relationship between light and change in melatonin was observed (p = 0.04). &#xd;

Conclusions: Taken together, these results contribute to the understanding of both the association between shift work and breast cancer, and the biologic mechanisms underlying this relationship. Since shift work is required for many occupations, understanding the mechanisms through which it impacts breast cancer is important to the development of healthy workplace policy.</description>

   <description>In this thesis, the redundancy resolution and failure analysis of Cable-Driven Parallel Manipulators (CDPM) are investigated. A CDPM consists mainly of a Mobile Platform (MP) actuated by cables. Cables can only apply force in the form of tension. So, to design a fully controllable CDPM, the manipulator has to be redundantly actuated (e.g., by using redundant cables, external force/moment or gravity). In this research, the redundancy resolution of planar CDPMs is investigated at the kinematic and dynamic levels in order to improve the manipulator safety, reliability and performance, e.g., by avoiding large tension in the cables that may result in high impact forces, and avoiding large MP velocities that may cause instability in the manipulator, or on the contrary, by increasing the cable tensions and the stiffness for high-precision applications. The proposed approaches are utilized in trajectory planning, design of controllers, and safe dynamic workspace analysis where collision is imminent and the safety of humans, objects and the manipulator itself are at risk. The kinematic and dynamic models of the manipulator required in the design and control of manipulators are examined and simulated under various operating conditions and manufacturing automation tasks to predict the behaviour of the CDPM. &#xd;
In the presented research, some of the challenges associated with the redundancy resolution are resolved including positive tension requirement in each cable, infinite inverse dynamic solutions, slow-computation abilities when using optimization techniques, failure of the manipulator, and elasticity of cables that has a significant role in the dynamics of a heavy loaded manipulator with a large workspace. Optimization-based and non-optimization-based techniques are employed to resolve the redundancy of CDPM. Depending on the advantages and disadvantages of each method, task requirements, the used redundancy resolution technique, and the objective function suitable optimization-based and non-optimization-based routines are employed. Methodologies that could combine redundancy resolution techniques at various levels (e.g., position, velocity, acceleration, and torque levels) are proposed.</description>

   <description>Exergames combine physical activity and entertainment in an effort to increase people’s motivation to exercise. Multiplayer exergames attempt to include the motivating aspects of group activity by allowing two or more people to play together. In most multiplayer exergames, a player’s in-game performance is limited by her physical abilities. Less fit players are demotivated by repeated losses to more fit opponents, while fitter players face a lack of competition from unfit opponents. This situation makes it difficult for people of disparate physical abilities to play exergames together.&#xd;
This research presents heart rate balancing, a novel player balancing technique to better support engaging experiences in multiplayer exergames. Heart rate balancing bases players’ in-game performance on their effort relative to fitness level rather than their raw power. More specifically, heart rate monitoring is used to set in-game performance based on how closely a person adheres to her target heart rate. Experiments with heart rate balancing show that the technique improves competition between players. A strong correlation was found between people’s perceived effort and their in-game performance with heart rate balancing. The degree to which players noticed the balancing mechanism varied depending on game type. However, heart rate balancing did not interfere with people’s ability to play exergames. These results indicate that the heart rate balancing technique is a promising approach for improving enjoyment and engagement in multiplayer exergames.</description>

   <description>On March 7 1963, some bombs exploded at a few military barracks in Québec. These blasts announced the start of a campaign mounted by the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ). The founders of Parti Pris responded in intellectual solidarity with the FLQ’s motives by publishing their first issue in October. By 1968, Parti Pris ceased publication. After the October Crisis in 1970, the FLQ was widely discredited. Although many Partipristes and Felquistes dispersed into more generalized circles of local activism and party politics, they defined, informed, and mobilized a new generation of Québécois towards national liberation between 1963 and 1970. During their time of influence, Partipristes and Felquistes consistently pointed to a Catholic morality in Québec that revered passivity as a root cause and symptom of their colonial oppression. Some historians have suggested they were aberrant apostles of rupture with Québec’s history and traditions. This sort of reading finds some basis in declamations of the radicals themselves. But this thesis argues that both Parti Pris and the FLQ were developments of, and not definitive breaks with, Québec’s Catholic tradition. By analyzing the writings of Partipristes Paul Chamberland, André Major, and Pierre Maheu alongside those of Felquistes Pierre Vallières and Francis Simard, it claims that no historical appreciation of their lives and generation can sidestep the Catholicism that shaped them as individuals and the social milieu to which they responded.</description>

   <description>Activation-tagging is a functional genomics technique where strong enhancers are inserted randomly into target genomes to over-activate endogenous genes. Phenotypes of interest can be selected for investigation of genetic factors contributing to the mutant phenotype. From initial screens of a population of activation-tagged potato, a mutant with chocolate-coloured tuber skin has been identified.  In this thesis, a novel sequence capture method for identifying T-DNA loci in activation tagged potato was used to characterize chocolate’s single T-DNA insertion locus. Transcriptome analysis of tuber periderm tissue was used to identify major processes occurring in the chocolate mutant. Our data suggest activation of a chitin-binding receptor-like kinase located 65 kb from T-DNA insert may cause activation of immune signaling pathways in chocolate. The present work explores a putative model of transcriptional and cellular responses involved in gain-of-function immune receptor activation. Selectively, these findings illustrate the periderm tissue as an important area of defense charged against biotic and abiotic stresses. Periderm development and anatomy are highly important for tuber storage. Further characterization of potato tuber periderm may contribute knowledge to model periderm systems and have implications for molecular breeding strategies to improve tuber storage quality.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Sociology) -- Queen's University, 2012-09-27 12:38:25.909</description>
   <description>Sociological explanations for human conduct usually place major ontological and epistemological emphasis upon either discursive or material relations without ever establishing or adequately specifying the validity of this dichotomy.  Early texts by the Critical Realist philosopher Roy Bhaskar address this forced separation by creating an integrated ontological and epistemological field that provides a more detailed and precise theoretical ordering to agents, objects, and entities.  Undertaking a developmental critique of Bhaskar’s arguments, this thesis extends Critical Realism’s role as theoretical ‘underlabourer’ and creates an expanded theoretical framework that balances discursive and material accounts.  Utilising the sophisticated analyses of the structure and operation of discourses found in the work of Michel Foucault alongside the innovative arguments for aleatory materialism developed by Louis Althusser, a critique is established that shows discursive, material, and social relations to be complex, immanent, and, importantly, mutually constitutive.  In each theory three core concepts of events, emergence, and the extra-discursive are shown to not only be present but also to operate as the main means of explaining social change.  The result of integrating Critical Realism, Foucault, and Althusser in this sympathetic but non-syncretic form is the generation of a non-reductionist materialism combined with discursive relations.  On this basis, social change is shown to be the result of restructured discursive and material relations of which human agents are only one part.  The thesis provides an illustration of the theoretical argument with an empirical component which examines the formation and decline of the British nuclear industry between its inception in the early 1950s to the year 2000.  The conclusion is that the form taken by nuclear energy is not entirely determined by any single one of political, economic, or scientific forces but is, instead, the product of multiple and complex interactions of immanent discursive and material relations that are, importantly, mutually reinforcing.</description>

   <description>Freshwater ecological issues are increasingly being recognized within the context of multiple stressors, even though relatively little is known about the limnological and biological consequences of the interactions between various environmental impacts.  Moreover, long-term monitoring data are often lacking. To help address these issues, the overall goal of this thesis was to use paleolimnological approaches to document how multiple environmental stressors have altered limnological communities in south-central Ontario lakes.  During the last two centuries, Ontario lakes have been subjected to varying intensities of different environmental impacts, including increases in shoreline residential development, forest clearance and regrowth, the deposition of strong acids via the atmosphere, invasion by non-indigenous species, and climate change.  I used multiple paleolimnological approaches to: 1) demonstrate how multiple natural and anthropogenic stressors have affected biological assemblages across lakes in the Muskoka-Haliburton region of south-central Ontario, and 2) reconstruct the limnological histories of four lakes from Algonquin Park  that have recorded the near complete extirpation of native crayfish species.  &#xd;
	In the Muskoka-Haliburton lakes, I assessed the extent of limnological changes that have occurred during the past ~15 years by resampling lakes from an earlier survey, using identical paleolimnological methods.  Limnological monitoring data document that, since 1992, the lakes have experienced declines in lakewater calcium and SO4 concentrations, while pH declined marginally; in contrast dissolved organic carbon, silica and Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen increased.  Marked regional increases in planktonic diatom taxa, including Cyclotella stelligera, Asterionella formosa and Fragilaria crotonensis, occurred in many lake systems, while colonial scaled chrysophyte algae have undergone a widespread decline in favour of unicellular forms (i.e., Mallomonas spp.), driven by interactions between resource limitation and climate change.&#xd;
	In the Algonquin Park study lakes, crustacean zooplankton remains revealed a marked decline in daphniid species with high Ca requirements, in favour of smaller Bosmina spp., while diatom and chrysophyte analysis suggest varying degrees of industrial acidification in the four study lakes.  The paleolimnological data suggest that the crayfish decline may have began prior to the long-term monitoring record, likely as a result of declines in pH and lakewater Ca related to atmospheric acid deposition.</description>

   <description>The quadrivalent (q-) human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is praised for its near perfect efficacy of 98% in the per-protocol population and minimal safety concerns. Adherence to the dosing schedule of 0, 2 and 6 months outside clinical trials has not yet been described. Furthermore, clinical trials were underpowered to detect rare, but serious, adverse events including convulsions, seizures and epilepsy in young girls targeted by American and Canadian national advisory committees.&#xd;
This retrospective cohort study followed Grade 8 girls eligible for Ontario’s HPV immunization program during the 2007/08 to 2010/11 campaign years. Using Ontario’s immunization and health databases, baseline characteristics, qHPV vaccination, dates of qHPV vaccination and diagnoses of serious neurological events were identified for each cohort member. The proportions of girls who initiated and completed the qHPV vaccine program were determined. Adherence to the recommended dosing intervals and for ‘time-to-series completion’ was calculated as the proportion of eligible girls whose number of days between doses complied with the recommended dosing interval. A self-matched, case only approach was used to estimate the age-adjusted rate ratio (RR) of neurological events in the 0-30 day period following qHPV vaccination. The primary study endpoint was a composite of the first occurrence of a convulsion, seizure or epilepsy. Secondarily, an epileptic seizure only endpoint was assessed, as were the influence of a number of predisposing risk factors.&#xd;
	 An overall uptake of 50.24% was observed, of which, 87.02% received at least three doses. Adherence to the recommended dosing interval was most difficult in scheduling of the second dose (70.80%). There was no increased risk observed for the primary endpoint in the 0-30 days following qHPV vaccination (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92-1.10). However, this association was modified in girls with predisposing risk factors for epilepsy. There was an increased risk observed for the epileptic seizure only endpoint (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.28-2.10).&#xd;
In Ontario, the overall uptake of the qHPV vaccine is low. Once initiated, series completion is high, with the majority receiving the vaccine in a timely manner. A risk for epileptic seizures following vaccination may be limited to girls with predisposing risk factors.</description>

   <description>Considering the increasing global prevalence of overweight and obesity and their propensity for disease, this study was undertaken in an attempt to optimize exercise prescription for this at-risk group by determining if the benefits associated with interval training occur in an intensity dependent manner. 19 sedentary, overweight males (Age: 22.7 ± 3.9 yrs, BMI: 31.4 ± 2.6 kg/m2, WC: 106.5 ± 6.6 cm) performed interval training for three weeks at either 70% or 100% of their peak work rate on a cycle ergometer. Aerobic capacity measurements, time to completion trials, muscle biopsies, and fasted blood samples were all performed pre and post training. Analyses of aerobic capacity and exercise performance demonstrate greater improvements made in the 100% compared to the 70% group, while measures of skeletal muscle oxidative capacity indicate equivalent changes between groups. Taking into account the similar increases in mitochondrial content in both groups and understanding the influence of both oxygen supply and demand in determining maximal oxygen consumption, the greater increases in aerobic capacity achieved by the 100% group may be the result of enhanced cardiovascular adaptations. These findings suggest that some of the health benefits associated with interval exercise may be intensity dependent. Therefore, there may be additional benefit to exercise at higher intensities.</description>

   <description>Normal intestinal functions are coordinated by enteric neurons within the enteric nervous system (ENS). In the embryonic and neonatal gut, enteric neuron survival is dependent on the expression of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) from its targets of innervation - the intestinal smooth muscle cells (ISMC). In the inflamed adult intestine, enteric neuron loss is immediately followed by ISMC proliferation, resulting in severe disruption of normal intestinal functions. Although GDNF can support the survival of postnatal enteric neurons, whether adult ISMC can secrete GDNF and support neuron survival is unclear. Results from qPCR analysis showed that freshly isolated adult ISMC have acquired the ability to express GDNF at the onset of proliferation, in vitro. Western blot analysis indicates that GDNF continues to be upregulated in ISMC at Passage 2 (P2), but its expression is decreased after long periods of proliferation at Passage 10 (P10). A neuron survival bioassay suggests that GDNF expression is correlated with enteric neuron survival. Results showed that P2 ISMC or conditioned media (CM) - but not P10 ISMC and CM, significantly increased enteric neuron survival. In subsequent experiments, the RET tyrosine kinase inhibitor vandetanib was used to block GDNF receptor-ligand interactions, and anti-GDNF neutralizing antibody was used to sequester soluble GDNF within the culture media. Both methods were successful at decreasing myenteric neuron survival. Furthermore, abolishing GDNF expression in P2 ISMC with GDNF siRNA also resulted in a decreased myenteric neuron survival. The above observations suggest that ISMC-derived GDNF is important in supporting myenteric neuron survival in vitro.</description>

   <description>Background: Work-related asthma (WRA) is under-recognized and early detection is associated with improved outcomes. The Work-related Asthma Screening Questionnaire (Long-version) (WRASQ(L)) is a 14-item tool designed to increase the detection of WRA in primary care.&#xd;
Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess whether the WRASQ(L) provided additional and reliable information on a patient’s likelihood of WRA, beyond what is collected in standard care, to explore the relationship of WRASQ(L) responses to clinical actions and to assess the use of the WRASQ(L) in the primary care setting.&#xd;
Methods: This was an intervention study involving two Ontario Primary Care Asthma Program (PCAP) sites assigned the WRASQ(L). Standard care for asthma patients in PCAP sites involved completing the Asthma Care Map (ACM), a clinical pathway which included seven WRA screening items. Consent to participate in this study involved completing an electronic WRASQ(L) at each visit for participants and prompted care providers to record details related to WRA investigations.&#xd;
Results: The study sample (N=37) was predominantly female (73.0%), with a mean age of 46.3 years (SD, 10.9). Use of the WRASQ(L) identified work-related symptoms, exposures and high- risk past occupations in 38% and 60% and 47% of participants, respectively, that were not identified in standard care. Two participants were newly-suspected cases of WRA during this study period. WRASQ(L) items demonstrated fair to moderate reproducibility, but estimates may have been subject to measurement error. Incorporation of the electronic WRASQ(L) in clinical care was limited by time constraints and technical factors, such as ease of use and flexibility of the application.&#xd;
Conclusions: The WRASQ(L) provided added information about possible WRA over standard care. Use of the questionnaire’s results by care providers in this study was limited due to barriers encountered in incorporating the use of the WRASQ(L) in clinical practice. Future directions include the validation of this tool in relation to WRA diagnosis. The WRASQ(L) has the potential to increase recognition of WRA, improving long-term health outcomes for those with WRA.</description>

   <description>The current studies addressed two questions regarding early social behaviour in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) that have not yet been directly explored.  In Study 1 we examined the hypothesis that impaired imitation in this group may reflect a diminished social motivation to engage, rather than a core deficit in imitation.  Young children with and without ASD engaged in imitation tasks during which controlled manipulations of reward (social and non-social) were administered for target behaviours.  Children with ASD displayed increased levels of imitation with the incentive of an external reward in comparison to when this reward was absent.  There was no differential impact of social versus non-social rewards.  Typically developing (TD) children performed similarly, irrespective of whether or not reward was administered.  We suggest that young children with ASD may be capable of imitating when appropriate incentives are present.  Study 2 explored the breadth of social challenges faced in young children with ASD by examining a later-developing domain of social functioning that may be compromised by early social difficulties.  We explored the tendency of children with ASD to engage in helping, sharing, and comforting behaviour in situations where the need for the prosocial behaviour was displayed and in perceptually similar situations where the need was absent.  Children with ASD displayed low levels of helping and sharing, but provided comfort at levels consistent with TD children.  For both comforting and sharing, children with ASD successfully discerned situations where a need was present from when it was not and adjusted their behaviour accordingly.  We suggest that children with ASD may require different ‘conditions’ to engage in social behaviours at the same level as their TD peers and suggest future research to this end.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Computing) -- Queen's University, 2012-09-27 23:41:46.455</description>
   <description>With the rapid proliferation of the internet, web browsers have evolved from single-purpose remote document viewers into multifaceted systems for executing dynamic, interactive web applications. In order to enhance the web browsing experience of users and to facilitate on-demand customizability, most web browsers now can be fitted with extensions: pieces of software that utilize the underlying web platform of a browser and provide a wide range of features such as advertisement blocking, safety ratings of websites, in-browser web development, and many more. Extensible web browsers provide access to their powerful privileged components in order to facilitate the development of feature-rich extensions. This exposure comes at a price, though, as a vulnerable extension can introduce a security hole through which an attacker can access the privileged components and penetrate a victim user’s browser, steal the user’s sensitive information, and even execute arbitrary code in the user’s computer. The current browser security model is inadequate for preventing attacks via such vulnerable extensions. Therefore, an effective protection mechanism is required that would provide web browsers adequate security while still allowing them to be extended.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, we propose a runtime protection mechanism for JavaScript-based browser extensions. Our protection mechanism performs offline randomization of an extension’s source code and augments the corresponding browser with appropriate modifications. The protection from malicious injection attacks is enforced at runtime by distinguishing attack code from the randomized extension code. Furthermore, for maximum backward compatibility with existing extensions, we propose a complementary static points-to analysis technique that can be invoked on-demand for assessing the security of dynamic code generation functions present in the source code of extensions. Our combined approach of runtime protection and static analysis is independent of the existing extension platforms, thus obviating the need of radically changing the platforms and requiring developers to rewrite their extensions. We implement our protection mechanism in the popular Mozilla Firefox browser and evaluate our approach on a set of vulnerable and non-vulnerable Mozilla Firefox extensions. The evaluation results indicate that our approach can be a viable solution for preventing attacks on JavaScript-based browser extensions while incurring negligible performance overhead and maintaining backward compatibility with existing extensions.</description>

   <description>The behavioural and neurological effects of excessive sucrose intake overlap with those of abused drugs, suggesting that sucrose bingeing should be categorized with addictive disorders. Behaviorally, a primary characteristic of drug addiction is compulsive responding, manifested as an inability to inhibit drug intake despite negative consequences. We examined whether excessive sucrose self-administration produces these behavioural patterns using a validated rat model of sucrose bingeing (Avena et al., 2008) and investigated potential neurophysiological correlates with brain slice electrophysiology. Rats (n = 8-16 per group) received 12 or 24 hour access to a 10% sucrose solution and food, while control groups received food only or a 0.1% saccharin solution with food, each day for 28 days. Sucrose/saccharin/food consumption and weight were recorded daily. Compulsive responding for sucrose was assessed one or 28 days after the final self-administration session using a conditioned suppression paradigm. Persistent responding in the presence of a cue (tone) predicting a negative outcome (0.5 mA footshock) was used as a measure of compulsive responding. Only rats given 12-hour access to sucrose developed a binge pattern of intake, in which solution consumption increased dramatically during the first hour of each session.  This group also developed compulsive responding for sucrose, exhibiting a reduced conditioned suppression effect following both one day and 28 days of abstinence. At a neural level, there was a switch in direction (from reduction to enhancement) in dopaminergic (DA) modulation of GABA synaptic transmission in the oval bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (ovBNST) of rats that developed a binge pattern of sucrose intake. This switch was similar to that recently observed in rats displaying enhanced motivation to self-administer cocaine. Therefore, excessive intermittent sucrose consumption produces compulsive responding and this shift from controlled to compulsive intake may involve the same neural mechanisms that underlie excessive cocaine self-administration.</description>

   <description>Transformations play a central role in Model Based Software Engineering. Similar to the development of other types of software, a transformation's specification and implementation does not necessarily remain static over the course of a project's lifetime; the transformation may develop incrementally and evolve. The goal of this thesis is to propose metrics that can be used to characterize the evolution of model transformations. To perform an initial demonstration of the metrics, this thesis considers an incrementally defined model transformation task. The transformation is implemented using two model transformation languages, a textual language and a graphical language, and metrics are extracted from the historical artifacts. &#xd;
&#xd;
The thesis defines a set of change metrics based on an abstract syntax difference model. Language feature metrics are also defined for both transformation languages. A process for extracting model-based change metrics and language metrics from the abstract syntax of the transformation languages is introduced. The applicability of the metrics in characterizing changes is demonstrated using exploratory clustering analysis on a transformation task. We show how, for this transformation task using both languages, metrics derived from the difference model result in clusters that reflect characteristics of individual changes, in contrast to clusters obtained with language metrics.</description>

   <description>The majority of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have milder airway obstruction and are not diagnosed in a timely fashion. Nevertheless, these patients are largely under-studied; this, despite new evidence of increased morbidity and mortality in this sub-population. Recent studies have highlighted the increased ventilatory requirements and abnormalities in respiratory mechanics as important features to explain the relatively reduced exercise tolerance and greater exertional dyspnea in these patients. However, it remains uncertain whether such abnormal mechanical factors actually limit exercise capacity in mild COPD. Accordingly, the objective of this study was to determine whether ventilatory constraints represent a primary factor in exercise limitation and increased dyspnea in this patient group. To determine the role of mechanical factors in exercise limitation in mild COPD, we selectively loaded the respiratory system by adding dead space (DS) to the breathing circuit. We compared ventilation, breathing pattern, operating lung volumes, and dyspnea intensity during incremental cycle exercise in 20 patients with GOLD stage I COPD (post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC=61±5%, and FEV1=95±11% predicted; mean±SD) and 20 healthy age-, sex- and BMI-matched subjects under two conditions, in randomized order: unloaded control (CTRL) or ventilatory stimulation by 600mL of an added DS. Compared to the CTRL condition, both healthy and COPD participants had small decreases in peak work rate and no significant increase in peak ventilation with the added DS. At the highest equivalent work rate of 60 watts, DS caused a smaller increase in tidal volume (VT) in COPD compared with healthy subjects (+0.26±0.29 vs. +0.56±0.22 L respectively, p&lt;0.01) with a correspondingly greater increase in dyspnea intensity (+1.8±1.8 vs. +0.2±0.6 Borg units, respectively, p&lt;0.0001). At peak exercise, COPD patients failed to significantly increase VT, reflecting the fact that end-inspiratory lung volume (EILV) could not increase with DS vs. CTRL (5.25±0.91 vs. 5.16±0.84 L, respectively, p=0.41). This contrasts the results in health where EILV increased with DS vs. CTRL (5.40±1.01 vs. 5.13±0.90 L, respectively, p&lt;0.05). We conclude that the lower exercise performance in mild COPD, compared with health, is explained by critical respiratory mechanical constraints which limit further increases in ventilation to support a higher metabolic load.</description>

   <description>T-joints are common in beam-column connections of steel frames, vierendeel girders and at mid-span of N-trusses. Strengthening the members of these structures increases the demand on the joints, which may require joint strengthening. This thesis examines different strengthening techniques of T-joints of RHS members.  In Phase I, the effectiveness of through-wall steel bolts is examined. This is accomplished by controlling the web outward buckling of the chord under the brace axial load. The study examined the effect of the number and pattern of bolts, as well as the web height-to-wall thickness (h/t) ratio of the chord, on strengthening effectiveness. Rectangular 203x76x(3.09, 4.5, and 5.92) mm chord members were tested. The 8 mm diameter steel bolts varied from a single bolt to 15 bolts of various distributions. The joint strength increased by 3.1%, 6.2%, and 29% for chords with (h/t) of 34, 45, and 65, respectively. The number and distribution of bolts had little effect on their effectiveness.&#xd;
	In Phase II, similar T-joint specimens were strengthened using adhesively bonded GFRP plates, 9.5 mm thick, of different configurations, and 2 mm thick high-modulus CFRP plates of equivalent stiffness. It was shown that strength gain increases significantly, from 9% to 38%, as (h/t) ratio of the HSS chord increases from 34 to 65. In thin-walled HSS (h/t = 65), retrofitting provided significant gains in strength but not in ductility. In thick-walled HSS (h/t = 34), retrofitting provided little strength gain, but enhanced ductility, especially with properly bonded plates extending on the brace. Generally, plates fractured under local bending or delaminated within plate layers while bond was fully intact.&#xd;
	In Phase III, selected configurations of the two retrofitting methods were used in additional T-joints with chord (h/t) ratio of 65, to study their effectiveness in presence of axial compression load in the chord. Two sustained load levels were induced in the chord, representing 45% and 80% of its full axial capacity. The transverse brace load was then gradually increased to failure. The through-wall steel bolts increased the joint capacity by 13% to 25%, depending on the chord’s axial load level, while the bonded GFRP plate increased the capacity by 38 to 46%.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Chemical Engineering) -- Queen's University, 2012-09-28 12:39:38.392</description>
   <description>A novel catalytic metal plate test reactor was designed, built and commissioned. The overall dimensions of the whole assembly were 215 mm long  75 mm wide  60 mm deep. A strip of stainless steel with dimensions of 150 mm long 15 mm wide  1.59 mm thick was partly coated with catalyst and sealed between the two reactor parts. The design provided a single channel flow pattern that could be easily modeled to extract kinetic parameters. A key feature of the reactor design was effective heat transfer to promote isothermal operation. A series of thermocouples was incorporated into the reactor to measure the temperature profile along the reactor.&#xd;
Performance of the reactor was verified using a well characterized commercially available Cu/Zn/Al2O3 catalyst from BASF. The goal of this experimentation was to determine the conversion, rate constant and activation energy for methanol steam reforming and compare these with previously published measurements.&#xd;
Methanol conversion was measured at slightly higher than atmospheric pressure at temperatures of 220, 240 and 260 °C. Steam to water ratio of feed was maintained at one during the experimental program. The feed rate of methanol was varied to obtain a catalyst to feed ratio   between 6 and 20 kgs mol-1. The composition of reformate and methanol conversion were studied with temperature and flow rate of the feed. An increase from 27.68 to 41.61% in methanol conversion was observed increasing the reaction temperature from 220 to 240°C.&#xd;
An irreversible first order rate constant was calculated using the experimentally measured conversion and space time. The apparent activation energy (Ea) based on a first order plug flow design operation was 96±4 k.J.mol-1 and agreed well with the values of 77-105.1 kJmol-1 reported in the literature.</description>

   <description>The bioeconomy, which would utilize biomass resources for the renewable production of energy, fuels, and products, has been proposed as a mechanism by which Ontario’s resource-dependent communities might be revitalized.  This thesis applies a knowledge economy framework to the establishment of a bioeconomy, with a strong focus on bioenergy as a first step, in Kingston and the surrounding region.  The knowledge economy approach was examined in relation to other measures of sustainability and security.  A series of 25 expert interviews informed an analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats on the topic of the knowledge-based bioeconomy study region.  The ability of the knowledge-based approach to assess the requirements of the bioeconomy was then evaluated using a statistical assessment of the study region based on Florida’s ‘creative economy’ framework, and this assessment was compared to key factors noted in the SWOT analysis.  Research findings indicate that basic necessities such as feedstock, technology and transportation routes are likely available across the study region.  However, key elements of the knowledge economy are absent particularly human resources in the ‘creative’ class.  The knowledge-based approach is not particularly well suited to capturing all aspects of the bioeconomy, as it overlooks physical geographical features, which may be better measured by other tools.  More focused policy with regard to renewable energy locally, provincially and nationally is seen to be important for advancing the bioeconomy.  Acting on opportunities and using regional strengths will insure a successful implementation of a knowledge-based bioeconomy that will provide the benefits of economic growth associated with knowledge economies.</description>

   <description>Characterizing the population genetic structure of a species can provide insight into isolating effects of local adaptation and genetic drift, and homogenizing effects of gene flow. The relative interplay between gene flow and genetic drift can indicate whether multiple conservation units are needed to preserve biodiversity. Baja California, Mexico is a biodiversity hotspot where many individuals are genetically differentiated from conspecific individuals breeding elsewhere. Cassin’s auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus), a zooplanktivorous seabird, breeds in colonies along the Pacific coast of North America. One subspecies, P. a. australe, is described from Baja California and another, P. a. aleuticus, is described from the rest of its range to the Aleutian Islands, Alaska. Many of the colonies throughout its range have been declining in numbers likely as a result of decreases in food availability in cold-water upwellings along the coast. The mitochondrial control region and eleven nuclear microsatellites were analyzed using programs based on coalescent and Bayesian theory to determine how the southern subspecies compares genetically to the main subspecies.&#xd;
	First, population genetic structure was characterized throughout Cassin’s auklet’s breeding range using pairwise genetic differentiation indices, hierarchical analysis of variance, statistical parsimony and Bayesian clustering methods. The two subspecies were genetically differentiated but individuals breeding in the Channel Islands were more genetically similar to P. a. australe individuals. Population genetic differentiation was not evident within the two genetic groups.&#xd;
	Second, gene flow between the two genetic groups was estimated using coalescent and Bayesian methods. Significant gene flow was estimated from the northern group (Aleutian Islands to Southeast Farallon Islands) into the southern group (Channel Islands to San Benito Island) but not from the southern group into the northern group since the time of divergence, possibly as a result of the non-breeding distribution. Results show that the two genetic populations diverged recently and the populations have experienced a recent population change in size. Restrictions in home range and foraging range may cause population genetic differentiation, resulting in two distinct management units. Genetic differentiation of the southern population provides support for Baja California and southern California being a biodiversity hotspot.</description>

   <description>The disproportionate incarceration of indigenous peoples in Canada is far more than a socio-economic legacy of colonialism. The Department of Indian Affairs (DIA) espoused incarceration as a strategic instrument of assimilation. Colonial consciousness could not reconcile evolving indigenous identities with projects of state formation founded on the epistemological invention of populating idle land with productive European settlements. The 1876 Indian Act instilled a stubborn, albeit false, categorization deep within the structures of the Canadian state: “Indian,” ward of the state. From “Indian” classification conferred at birth, the legal guardianship of the state was so far-reaching as to make it akin to the control of incarcerated inmates. As early iterations of the DIA sought to enforce the legal dominion of the state, “Indians” were quarantined on reserves until they could be purged of indigenous identities that challenged colonial hegemony. Reserve churches, council houses, and schools were symbolic markers as well as practical conveyors of state programs. Advocates of Christianity professed salvation and taught a particular idealized morality as prerequisites to acceptable membership in Canadian society. Agricultural instructors promoted farming as a transformative act in the individual ownership of land. Alongside racializing religious edicts and principles of stewardship, submission to state law was a critical precondition of enfranchisement into the adult milieu. When indigenous identities persisted, children were removed from their families and placed in residential schools for intensive assimilation. Adults and children deemed noncompliant to state laws were coerced through incarceration. Jails were powerful symbols of the punitive authority of the Dominion of Canada. Today, while the overrepresentation of Aboriginal persons in prisons is a matter of national concern, and critiques of systematic racism dismantle ideologies of impartial justice, the precise origins of indigenous imprisonment have not been identified. The DIA was so intimately invested in assimilation through incarceration that lock-ups were erected with band funds on “Indian lands” across Canada. Archival documents and the landscape of Manitoulin Island make this legal historical geographical analysis of assimilation through incarceration possible.</description>

   <description>Transformations of the various agricultural systems have been taking place in the coastal zone of Bangladesh. While some farmers continue to follow traditional practices, in recent years, others have become involved in massive shrimp cultivation, shrimp-rice cultivation, a rice-based improved agricultural system or a shrimp-rice-vegetable integrated system. All these types of agriculture are being practiced under highly vulnerable environmental conditions. The long-term livelihood, food security and adaptation of the coastal people largely depend on the sustainability of these agricultural practices. In this context, assessing the level of sustainability is extremely important and will be essential for developing future policy options in Bangladesh. &#xd;
This study attempts to examine the sustainability of agricultural practices in the coastal region of Bangladesh. A field study was carried out in 2011 in five villages of five upazilas in the mature and active delta areas of the country. The data were collected through in-depth questionnaire surveys, focus groups discussions, field observation, key informants and secondary materials. A comprehensive suite of indicators was developed considering productivity, efficiency, stability, durability, compatibility and equity of the coastal agriculture. The categories and the indicators were weighted using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to measure the sustainability level of five study sites. &#xd;
The integrated agricultural system (shrimp-rice-vegetable) of Dumuria appeared to be the most sustainable system among agricultural practices, and other integrated systems (rice-based improved agricultural system) of Kalaroa were also found to show a good level of sustainability. The massive shrimp cultivation system of Shyamnagar and Kaliganj appears to be least sustainable. A traditional agriculture system with some improved methods followed in Bhola Sadar also performed in a satisfactory manner, but there were limitations in terms of its location in the active delta. The level of the sustainability measured in this study allows for a comparison among agricultural practices of the five study sites. The information generated from the study may be used in formulating policies for this part of the country. Measuring agricultural sustainability in this way produces a useful summary of sustainability issues and also provides some vital learning experiences. &#xd;
A holistic and interdisciplinary approach is attempted in this study for assessing and comparing the sustainability level of coastal agricultural systems. It has the potential to become useful as one of the frameworks for sustainability assessment.</description>

   <description>A literature review of municipal solid waste landfill design was conducted to provide the knowledge base for development of an environmental decision support system (Landfill Advisor). Landfill Advisor integrates the current knowledge of barrier systems into a software program to assist in landfill design. The choices available for each liner component (e.g., drainage layer, geomembrane liner, compacted clay liner, geosynthetic clay liner) and their suitability for different situations (e.g., final cover, base liner, lagoon liner) are presented. Landfill Advisor covers both the design and related operational issues for municipal solid waste landfills, with consideration given to the interactions between components, operating conditions, and the natural environment with a view to maximization of long-term system performance. Unique to Landfill Advisor, the service life of each engineered component is estimated based on results from the latest research.&#xd;
	Original research is also presented on the risk of geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) desiccation in low stress applications such as solar ponds. Numerical modelling was undertaken using a thermo-hydro-mechanical model with parameters that were developed and verified by comparison to previously reported laboratory data. A parametric study was performed to establish recommendations for future investigation. The water retention curve of the GCL was found to have a significant effect on the conditions that are expected to cause desiccation. The temperature coefficient of the water retention curve was also found to have a significant effect, yet this parameter is not well defined. Poisson’s ratio was found to affect the risk of desiccation in proportion to the applied stress. As reported by previous researchers, the initial degree of saturation of a GCL was found to be important to desiccation; however, the effect is diminished at low applied stress.</description>

   <description>Living radical polymerization has proved to be a powerful tool for the synthesis of polymers as it allows for a high degree of control over the polymer microstructure and the synthesis of tailored molecular architectures. Although it has great potential, its use on an industrial scale is limited due to environmental and economical aspects. Nitroxide mediated polymerization is explored to bring this technology closer to adoption in commercial applications. &#xd;
One of the obstacles encountered using nitroxide mediated polymerization in microemulsion systems is the difficulty in controlling both the particle size and target molecular weight. Due to the nature of the formulation, a decrease in the target molecular weight is coupled to an increase in the particle size. For many applications, it is important to be able to design polymer particles with both specifications independently. Strategies to decouple these two properties and processing conditions required for targeting a range of particle sizes and molecular weights for n butyl acrylate latexes are presented. Furthermore, in an attempt to reduce the large amounts of surfactant typically used in microemulsions, these methods were explored at low surfactant to monomer ratios (0.2 to 0.5 by wt.) in order to reduce the costs associated with excess surfactant and post processing steps for surfactant removal (high surfactant levels also give poor water-resistance in coatings). Stable nanolatexes with particle sizes &lt;40 nm have been obtained by other groups using NMP in microemulsions with SG1 but have done so by using much higher surfactant to monomer ratios (~2.5 by wt.) and at much lower solids content (6 10 wt. %). In this work, molecular weights of 20,000 to 80,000 g∙mol-1 were targeted and stable, n-butyl acrylate microemulsions with particle sizes ranging from 20 120 nm were prepared at a solids content of 20 wt. % using much lower surfactant concentrations. Although numerous studies have shown the effects of process parameters on particle sizes and methods to control the molecular weight, the decoupling of the molecular weight and particle size effect in NMP microemulsions under these conditions has not been done to this extent.&#xd;
In copolymer systems, nitroxide mediated polymerization also provides an efficient method to synthesize well defined block copolymers. Random copolymers are widely used as protective colloids, but the use of block copolymers for these applications has not been well studied. It is unclear what effects do the importance of a narrow molecular weight distribution and purity of block copolymers have on their performance as protective colloids. In order to investigate this, a range of block copolymers with different properties would need to be synthesized for systematic analysis. The direct synthesis of polystyrene b poly(acrylic acid) copolymers of varying lengths and compositions was successful by use of nitroxide mediated polymerization in bulk and solution polymerization. The characterization of these amphiphilic block copolymers was explored by titration and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.</description>

   <description>The detailed observational analysis of three massive B- and O-type stars was carried out in this study in order to characterize their fundamental, magnetic, and variability properties. The bulk of the data acquired were obtained with the high-resolution ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter at the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope, within the context of the Magnetism in Massive Stars (MiMeS) project. Two of these stars (HR5907 and HD57682) are newly detected magnetic stars, discovered from observations acquired as part of the broader survey component of the MiMeS program, while the last star, ω Ori, was previously reported as magnetic in the literature.&#xd;
 &#xd;
The rotation periods of HR5907 and HD57682 were inferred from photometric, Hα emission and longitudinal field variations. A period of 0.508276 was inferred for HR5907, making this the shortest period, non-degenerate, magnetic massive star identified to date. Furthermore, ultraviolet and optical spectroscopy were combined to infer the fundamental properties of HR5907 and HD57682. Direct modelling of the Least-Squares Deconvolved line profiles and the longitudinal magnetic field measurements were used to infer the magnetic properties of HR5907, HD57682, and ω Ori. A detailed investigation of the newly obtained and archival polarimetric data of ω Ori revealed no convincing evidence for a magnetic field, despite evidence of variability in some emission quantities in this dataset, which had been previously attributed to a large-scale magnetic field. The strength and variability of the optical photospheric helium lines of HR5907 suggests that this star is He-rich, with a non-uniform distribution of its surface chemistry. Lastly, the emission variations in the hydrogen lines of HR5907 suggest this star hosts a highly-structured, rigidly-rotating,&#xd;
 centrifugally supported magnetosphere. Similarly, line profile variations throughout&#xd;
 the optical spectrum of HD57682 are attributed to emission variations caused by a&#xd;
 rotationally-modulated, dynamical magnetosphere.&#xd;
&#xd;
As magnetism in massive stars is a relatively rare and poorly-studied phenomenon,&#xd;
 these studies comprise the bulk of the detailed investigations of magnetic massive&#xd;
 stars carried out to date. The results of these investigations are also discussed in the context of addressing the current outstanding issues related to magnetism in massive stars.</description>

   <description>The public education system in Ontario, like many other education systems worldwide, is currently undergoing drastic changes effected by globalization. The globalization of education, which can be understood as “the worldwide discussions, processes, and institutions affecting local education practices and policies” (Spring, 2009, p. 1), has led to Ontario’s curriculum being used in over 20 schools located outside the province (Ontario Ministry of Education, 2011). Because these schools grant the Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD), students must satisfy the same graduation requirements as those students who attend secondary school located in Ontario. &#xd;
A requirement for graduation includes the successful completion of the Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test (OSSLT), a large-scale assessment intended to measure literacy. English Language Learners (ELLs) have more difficulty passing the OSSLT than their peers who speak English as their first language (Doe, Cheng, Klinger, &amp; Zheng, 2011; Fox &amp; Cheng, 2007). This issue is of particular concern to educators and students at these schools. Because the majority of these schools are located in China, my study focuses on ELLs in one school in China which uses the Ontario curriculum. The purpose of my study is twofold: 1) to understand how Chinese English Language Learners perceive the news report on the OSSLT, and 2) to understand how issues of culturally embedded knowledge affect their ability to take the test (the OSSLT) successfully. &#xd;
	I selected a qualitative research approach because the intent of this study was to understand the perspectives of Chinese ELLs. I conducted three focus groups with one class of ELLS in one secondary school in China.  I also used observations and analysis of written artifacts to triangulate the collected data.&#xd;
	The findings of this study revealed some challenges and perspectives on the OSSLT specific to Chinese ELLs. I conclude that the issue of cultural literacy is a key factor preventing Chinese ELLs from demonstrating their true level of literacy on the OSSLT.</description>

   <description>This project engages theories of settler colonialism, biopower, and the state of exception to analyze the operations of rights-based narratives of citizenship in relation to political dissent in Canada. I argue that a normalized state of exception founds the white supremacist, settler colonial state, bringing Canadian citizenship into being as a (white) racialized, (cis)gendered, and (hetero)sexualized construct. By examining “resistance narratives” about the Toronto G20 that emerged in the post-G20 climate, my work argues that, in treating the policing practices employed during the G20 as exceptional and in (re)producing the exaltation of white heterosexual cis-masculine citizens, these narratives normalize and reinforce the daily operations of the exception, which targets Indigenous, racialized, and other “Others” in Canada. Finally, my work critically engages with the space of the Eastern Detention Centre (EDC) as a temporary camp set up to detain G20 arrestees, and with the narrative of “Torontonamo” that emerged to describe and explain the EDC. Reading the EDC in the context of other spatial organizations of the exception in Canada, I argue that the “Torontonamo” narrative reasserts race thinking in relation to the normalized operations of the exception. In so doing, it (re)produces white citizen-subjects as the proper recipients of national and international human rights, while abandoning racialized populations to the space of the camp. Ultimately, my work writes against the hegemonic view of the Toronto G20 as an exceptional event in Canadian history. I contend that G20 policing practices were only a hyper-visible example of the normalized operations of the exception within settler colonialism.</description>

   <description>The focus of this thesis is the normative base of moral liability to defensive harm. Many argue that liability is what makes it morally permissible to seriously injure or kill in self-defense or in the defense of others. Authors such as Jonathan Quong and Jeff McMahan argue that liability not only has important implications for the individual morality of self-defense, but that it plays a major role in the principles of just war conduct. How you determine when someone is liable will have a significant impact on when someone can be harmed. In this paper, I focus on the question of what a person must do to be morally liable to defensive harm. More specifically, I take a close look at Jeff McMahan’s moral responsibility account of liability and argue that it is unsatisfying as an explanation of when and why a person is liable. I then argue that an evidence-based account of liability better captures our moral intuitions surrounding liability. I end by considering an argument put forward by Quong on why we should not support an evidence-based account of liability.</description>

   <description>In "Famine, Affluence, and Morality," Peter Singer urges citizens of wealthy countries to make immense personal sacrifices in order to assist the poor overseas.  Though Singer has moderated his view in recent years and now supports widespread tithing, the motivation remains the same.  By contrast, Immanuel Kant contends that the first right of humanity is freedom and that the purpose of a political order is to unite people into a rightful condition.  As part of this, taxes should be imposed in order to support the domestic poor - an obligation that does not extend across borders.&#xd;
&#xd;
Although their underlying assumptions are quite different, Singer and Kant’s concerns can both be addressed by a common solution: the creation of a global tax to support the poor, implemented by a global state.  Such an arrangement would permit substantial coordinated flows of aid to the needy (meeting Singer’s utilitarian concerns) while also ensuring that all people of the world are in a rightful condition with each other, thereby providing the justification for global social assistance (respecting Kantian deontology.)  This solution requires expanding Singer’s proposals and a revisionist reading of Kant that dismisses his arguments against the creation of a global state.  (Rawls’ support for a world of distinct states that support each other can also be dismissed, as his approach does not sufficiently connect political structures with personal duty, as Singer and Kant both do.)&#xd;
&#xd;
Though the final form of the solution is largely the same, Kant’s framework is superior: while Singer cannot eliminate the danger of becoming overwhelmed by duty, Kant’s focus on individual autonomy can guard against this.</description>

   <description>G.A. Cohen’s critique of John Rawls holds that it is insufficient to approach the problem of justice as one of principles governing laws and institutions alone. Instead, an appropriate social ethos must motivate the citizens to act from these principles in order to ensure that society is characterized by equality. The following will argue that Cohen’s concerns with Rawls are well-founded. However, even citizens motivated by a sense of justice will possess motives that are non-egoistic, yet inegalitarian in effect. Therefore, just citizens should not be expected to enact the same principles as just institutions.</description>

   <description>The objectives of the present study were: 1) to determine if there is a sex-based difference in lifting technique across increasing load conditions; and, 2) to examine the use of body size-adjusted tasks and back strength-adjusted loads in the analysis of lifting technique. Eleven male and 14 female participants (n=25) with no previous history of low back pain participated in the study. Participants completed freestyle, symmetric lifts of a box with handles from the floor to table height for five trials under three load conditions (10%, 20%, and 30% of their individual maximum isometric back strength). Joint kinematic data for the ankle, knee, hip, and lumbar and thoracic spine were collected using a two-camera Optotrak 3020 system (NDI, Waterloo, ON). Joint angles were calculated using a three-dimensional Euler rotation sequence and PCA was applied to assess differences in lifting technique across the entire waveform. A repeated measures ANOVA with a mixed design revealed no significant effect of sex for any of the PCs. This was contrary to previous research that used discrete points on the lifting curve to analyze sex-based differences but agreed with more recent research using more complex analysis techniques. There was a significant effect of load on lifting technique for six PCs of the lower limb (p&lt;0.005).  However, there was no significant difference in lifting technique for the thoracic and lumbar spine. It was concluded that, when load is standardized to individual back strength characteristics, males and females adopted a similar lifting technique. In addition, as load increases participants used more of a semi-squat or squat lifting technique.</description>

   <title>Functional Chemometrics: Automated Spectral Smoothing with Spatially Adaptive Splines</title>

   <description>Functional data analysis (FDA) is a demonstrably effective, practical, and powerful method of data analysis, yet it remains virtually unheard of outside of academic circles and has almost no exposure to industry. FDA adds to the milieu of statistical methods by treating functions of one or more independent variables as data objects, analogous to the way in which discrete points are the data objects we are familiar with in conventional statistics.&#xd;
The first step in functional analysis is to “functionalize” the data, or convert discrete points into a system represented most times by continuous functions. Choosing the type of functions to use is data-dependent and often straightforward – for example, Fourier series lend themselves well to periodic systems, while splines offer great flexibility in approximating more irregular trends, such as chemical spectra.&#xd;
This work explores the question of how B-splines can be rapidly and reliably used to denoised infrared chemical spectra, a difficult problem not only because of the many parameters involved in generating a spline fit, but also due to the disparate nature of spectra in terms of shape and noise intensity. Automated selection of spline parameters is required to support high-throughput analysis, and the heteroscedastic nature of such spectra presents challenges for existing techniques. &#xd;
The heuristic knot placement algorithm of Li et al. (2005) for 1D object contours is extended to spectral fitting by optimizing the denoising step for a range of spectral types and signal/noise ratios, using the following criteria: robustness to types of spectra and noise conditions, parsimony of knots, low computational demand, and ease of implementation in high-throughput settings. Pareto-optimal filter configurations are determined using simulated data from factorial experimental designs. The improved heuristic algorithm uses wavelet transforms and provides improved performance in robustness, parsimony of knots and the quality of functional regression models used to correlate real spectral data with chemical composition. In practical applications, functional principal component regression models yielded similar or significantly improved results when compared with their discrete partial least squares counterparts.</description>

   <description>The purpose of this thesis was to examine changes in the expression of translation regulatory proteins following both an acute bout of endurance exercise and chronic muscle contractile activity. In experiment 1, female Sprague-Dawley rats ran for 2 h at 15 m/min followed by an increase in speed of 5 m/min every 5 min until volitional fatigue. Red gastrocnemius muscle was harvested from non-exercised animals (control), immediately following cessation of exercise (0 h) and after 3 hours of recovery (3 h). Compared to control, rpS6 mRNA was elevated (p &lt; .05) at both 0 h (+32%) and 3 h (+47%). Both eIF2Bε (+127%) and mTOR mRNA (+44%) were higher than control at 3 h, while eIF4E decreased (-24%) immediately following exercise (p &lt; .05). Phosphorylation of mTOR (+40%) and S6K1 (+266%) also increased immediately post-exercise (p &lt; .05). In experiment 2, female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent chronic stimulation of the peroneal nerve continuously for 7 days. The red gastrocnemius muscle was removed 24 h following cessation of the stimulation. Chronic muscle stimulation up-regulated (P &lt; .05) mTOR protein (+74%), rpS6 (+31%), and eIF2α (+44%, P &lt; .07), and this was accompanied by an increase in cytochrome C (+31%). Phosphorylation of rpS6 (Ser235/Ser236) was increased (+51%, P &lt; .05), while mTOR (Ser2448) and 4E-BP1 (Thr37/46) did not change. These experiments demonstrate that acute and chronic endurance contractile activity up-regulate the mTOR signalling pathway and mitochondrial content in murine skeletal muscle. This up-regulation of the mTOR pathway may increase translation efficiency and may also represent an important control point in exercise mediated mitochondrial biogenesis.</description>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Cultural Studies) -- Queen's University, 2012-09-30 23:49:58.642</description>
   <description>In this thesis I argue that anarchism, as a political philosophy and social movement practice committed to resisting all forms of oppression and domination, needs to place colonialism more clearly and consistently at the centre of its analysis of interlocking systems of oppression. I argue that colonialism has largely been absent as a system of domination and oppression within anarchist theory and practice, with the exception of a small number of theorists and activist groups. My contention is that an anti-colonial orientation needs to be further encompassed in part because of anarchism’s commitment to resisting all forms of oppression and domination, but also because anarchist movements carry out and theorize resistance against the backdrop of settler colonial realities and on Indigenous lands. This thesis contributes to these aims by seeking to expand and push further work done on anarcha-Indigenism that examines the possible points of contact and resonance between anarchist and Indigenous politics, philosophy and action. &#xd;
&#xd;
I conceptualize anarcha-Indigenism first as a ‘third space’, following post-colonial theorists, and extend this concept towards an ‘n-dimensional’ space of meeting, where theoretical perspectives can come to engage with one another. This space consists of points of contact and resonance chiefly between Indigenist, anarchist and feminist theory and practice, but also extends to any perspective that might meet the core commitments of anarcha-Indigenism, namely resistance to all forms of oppression and domination. Within the ‘n-dimensional’ space of anarcha-Indigenism I examine the possibilities of anti-colonial research methodology, solidarity relationships between settlers and Indigenous peoples, engagements between anarchist and Indigenous feminisms and contemporary manifestations of anti-colonial anarchist resistance against the 2010 Vancouver Olympics and the Toronto G20. These successive chapters seek to make anti-colonial interventions into anarchist theory and practice as well as further develop the richness of anarcha-Indigenism and its complexities. Overall, I argue that anarcha-Indigenism, as an ‘n-dimensional’ space of meeting can further resistance to all forms of oppression and domination, and has the ability to make anti-colonial interventions into anarchist theory and practice specifically.</description>

   <title>Higher Brain Neurons Succumb to Acute Stroke-Like Insult While Lower Brain Neurons Strongly Resist</title>

   <subject>Stroke Neurophysiology Anoxic Depolarization</subject>
   <description>Thesis (Ph.D, Anatomy &amp; Cell Biology) -- Queen's University, 2012-10-02 17:59:20.589</description>
   <description>Pyramidal neurons (PyNs) in ‘higher’ brain are highly susceptible to acute stroke injury yet ‘lower’ brain regions better survive global ischemia, presumably because of better residual blood flow. Here we show that projection neurons in ‘lower’ brain regions of hypothalamus and brainstem intrinsically resist acute stroke-like injury independent of blood flow in the brain slice. In contrast `higher` projection neurons in neocortex, hippocampus, striatum and thalamus are highly susceptible. In live brain slices from rat deprived of oxygen and glucose (OGD), we imaged anoxic depolarization (AD) as it propagates through these regions. AD, the initial electrophysiological event of stroke, is a depolarizing front that drains residual energy in compromised gray matter. The extent of AD reliably determines ensuing damage in higher brain, but using whole-cell recordings we found that all CNS neurons do not generate a robust AD. Higher neurons generate strong AD and show no functional recovery in contrast to neurons in hypothalamus and brainstem that generate a weak and gradual AD. Most dramatically, lower neurons recover their membrane potential, input resistance and spike amplitude when oxygen and glucose is restored, while higher neurons do not. Following OGD, new recordings could be acquired in all lower (but not higher) brain regions, with some neurons even withstanding multiple OGD exposure. Two-photon laser scanning microscopy confirmed neuroprotection in lower, but not higher gray matter. Specifically pyramidal neurons swell and lose their dendritic spines post-OGD, whereas neurons in hypothalamus and brainstem display no such injury. Exposure to the Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitor ouabain (100 μM), induces depolarization similar to OGD in all cell types tested. Moreover, elevated [K+]o evokes spreading depression (SD), a milder version of AD, in higher brain but not hypothalamus or brainstem so weak AD correlates with the inability to generate SD.&#xd;
In summary, overriding the Na+/K+ pump using OGD, ouabain or elevated [K+]o evokes steep and robust depolarization of higher gray matter. We show that this important regional difference can be largely accounted for by the intrinsic properties of the resident neurons and that Na+/K+ ATPase pump efficiency is a major determining factor generating strong or weak spreading depolarizations.</description>

   <description>Professional furniture movers must carry objects of all shapes, sizes and weights. When carrying boxes between a house and the moving van, professional movers will carry boxes two different ways. The first way is holding the box in their hands in front of their body, and the second way is holding the box behind them and leaning forward so the box can rest on their backs while walking. The Mover’s Assistive Device (MAD) is an aid developed to decrease the effort of movers when carrying boxes and has been shown to reduce the amount of needed grip strength.&#xd;
The goals of this research were to compare the effects of technique (carrying in front or behind the body) as well as the effects of using the MAD on the way movers coordinate their 1) legs and 2) trunk and hips. Movement was tracked using a camera system and reflective markers attached to the participants. In study 1 ten male participants completed the four different carrying conditions on a treadmill. The different segments of the leg did not change coordination patterns between the front and back carries, however, the coordination was more stable (similar across all steps) in the front carry. When participants used the MAD, their legs moved in a more coordinated motion than when they did not use the MAD, and is considered to be useful in maintaining balance and control while carrying a box. In study 2 thirteen male participants completed the four different carrying conditions on a treadmill. The trunk and the hips did not change coordination between the front and back carries, but they became more coordinated when participants were wearing the MAD. A more coordinated motion between the trunk and hips is suggested to be beneficial to low back health.</description>

   <title>Imaging Spreading Depolarization in the Brainstem</title>

   <description>Within two minutes of global ischemia or focal stroke, a sudden loss of neuronal and glial membrane potential induces anoxic depolarization (AD) that propagates across gray matter of the cerebral hemispheres at 2-5 mm/min. It induces terminal neuronal damage, forming the initial ischemic core. In healthy gray matter, a milder version termed spreading depression (SD) does not cause tissue damage and generates the migraine aura, often a marching sensory deficit preceding the pain. AD and SD have been well studied in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices, but not the in the brainstem. We induced AD in coronal brain slices of mouse using oxygen/glucose deprived (OGD) saline. SD was induced by briefly elevating the extracellular K+ concentration. AD or SD propagation was imaged as a moving front of elevated light transmittance (LT) in cerebral and cerebellar cortices. Most ventral brainstem areas did not support AD or SD but in the dorsal brainstem some LT mini-fronts were observed in the superficial superior colliculus (SC), edges of inferior colliculus (IC), periaqueductal gray (PAG), tegmental nucleus (TN) and solitary nucleus (SolN). Their AD/SD characteristics were compared to those in the ‘higher’ brain regions. Although time of onset was not different, the present AD and SD propagated more slowly in brainstem gray matter. A non-specific glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenic acid (KYNA) successfully blocked the SD but not AD in PAG, TN and SolN. Two-photon laser scanning microscopy (2-PLSM) of live YFP+ mice brain slices showed that pyramidal neurons in ‘higher’ hippocamal CA1 irreversibly swelled and formed dendritic beads while neurons in the ‘lower’ mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus (Mes) of the midbrain-pons did not significantly swell or display any sign of injury.  Finally, dendritic beading was induced in intact mouse neocortex and hippocampus by cardiac perfusion with OGD saline or ice-cold saline. However, dendrites in the brainstem from the same mice showed no obvious beading. Taken together, our study supports the concept that most brainstem regions are comparatively resistant to AD/SD compared to the ‘higher’ regions of cerebral and cerebellar cortices.</description>

   <description>In the last decade mineable oil sands production in Canada has grown rapidly. Constraints on the planning and design processes employed by surface mining oil sands operations vary in distinct ways from other commodities mined by both hard and soft rock open pit methods.  The unique waste handling needs, including tailings disposal, of contemporary oil sands mining requires specific planning considerations.&#xd;
&#xd;
It is the purpose of this research to analyze and document a conventional hard rock, metal mine planning system, and contrast this with the unconventional mine planning system used by oil sands mines.  Systems activity models of both the conventional and unconventional systems are developed in support of documenting and contrasting the two systems.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Constraints unique to oil sands mine planning are identified and their impact on the oil sands mine planning system are documented.  The impacts of challenging waste handling and storage requirements and a uniquely prescriptive regulatory environment defining mineable ore are identified as key constraints.&#xd;
&#xd;
The research concludes with a proposal for a new planning system to better support the planning of oil sands mines.  The proposed system respects the unique waste management considerations in oil sands planning and revisits the current regulatory approach to ensuring resource recovery. The proposed system is compatible with traditional approaches to economic analysis in open pit planning, and with emerging best practices to manage technical and economic uncertainty, improve project optimization, and develop robust mine plans.</description>

   <title>In Pursuit of Equality: Bringing Human Dignity to the Forefront of Section 15</title>

   <description>Thesis (Master, Philosophy) -- Queen's University, 2012-10-02 11:09:56.411</description>
   <description>While it is clear that section 15 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms should be read as prohibiting only of those violations of equality that amount to discrimination, it remains unclear how to determine what it means for a state to treat its citizens as equals, and more specifically, what constitutes discrimination. Thus, the idea of human dignity in section 15 the Charter has been, in many ways, groundbreaking in its recognition of the far-reaching impact of unequal treatment. There remains, however much scholarly dissension surrounding the concept’s meaning and use within section 15 equality jurisprudence. As a result, many have argued that the concept suffers from ambiguity and indeterminacy, thus creating an additional burden on equality claimants. This work advances the thesis that the concept of human dignity, understood in the objective sense as autonomy and self-determination, explains the nature and scope of the government’s obligation to show equal concern and respect, and offers us valuable guidance as to why certain types of unequal treatment are unfair and illegitimate. The concept can, I believe, help to delineate how equality is to be conceived, specified and realised under section 15 of the Charter. To make my case, I reject and show as flawed the Supreme Court of Canada’s interpretation and use of dignity in section 15(1) jurisprudence. Finally, in an attempt to demonstrate that the concept of dignity is relevant and necessary to an analysis of discrimination, I show that such a concept is in fact grounded in Sophia Moreau’s own illuminating account of the wrongs of unequal treatment.</description>
