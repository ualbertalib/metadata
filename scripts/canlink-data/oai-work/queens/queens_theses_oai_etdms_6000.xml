   <description>Renal fibrosis is a dominant pathological characteristic of progressive Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal-Transition (EMT), triggered by tissue damage, caused by renal inflammation, initiates and expands interstitial renal fibrosis. Renal fibrosis can, in turn, cause abnormalities in vitamin D and mineral metabolism, and therefore CKD patients are often vitamin D- deficient and hyperphosphatemic. Treatment of CKD patients with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3, the active form of vitamin D) has been shown to ameliorate fibrosis, but it can also cause hypercalcemia and possibly exacerbate vascular and soft tissue calcification. We have hypothesized that, due to the longer half-life of calcifediol, or 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25D3), and the feedback-controlled activation of this prohormone, treatment of renal fibrosis in a murine Unilateral Ureteral Obstruction (UUO) model would suppress renal inflammation and fibrosis without inducing hypercalcemia. We have treated UUO mice by subcutaneous injection of 25D3 and 1,25D3, and compared their effects on suppression of renal fibrosis, using histological and molecular parameters, for one or two weeks, and monitored various markers of fibrosis and inflammation. Treatment of UUO mice kept on a normal diet with 25D3 significantly suppressed the expression level of the major fibrotic and inflammatory markers without inducing hypercalcemia. If the animals were kept on a vitamin D-deficient diet, the expected anti-fibrotic effects of vitamin D treatment were not achievable. Also, through in vitro studies, the regulatory effect of the inflammatory and fibrotic factors TGFβ1, TNFα, and FGF23 in the presence and absence of 1,25D3, on the expression level as well as regulation of Cyp24a1 (the vitamin D catabolizing enzyme) promoter construct were examined. These studies revealed that TGFβ1 and FGF23 in the presence of vitamin D could induce synergistic upregulation of the Cyp24a1 mRNA, and Tnfα in the presence of vitamin D abrogated upregulation of the enzyme with 1,25D3. Further mutational analysis of the hCYP24A1 promoter confirmed the significant role of major DNA binding elements for the transcriptional effects of TGFβ1 and FGF23.</description>

   <description>This thesis problematizes truth-telling about historical injustices in the settler state context of Canada. Truth-telling, in the field of transitional justice, is a survivor-centred process that is typically facilitated by truth commissions to generate a new historical record about a previously denied historical injustice. Truth-telling and compensation are often coupled as reparations for an historical injustice. Within the transitional justice framework, these two measures fall under the “Right to Know” and the “Right to Reparation” respectively. Extending studies of (settler) governmentality (Foucault 2009; Monaghan 2013; Walters 2012) and theories of Indigenous resurgence and decolonization (Alfred 2005; Coulthard 2014; Simpson 2011a, 2016a; Tuck and Yang 2012), this research finds compensation works against the truth-telling of survivors by erasing key aspects of historical injustice within the records of the Canadian civil service. I make this broad argument through three sub-claims. First, I argue that compensation influences the development of new historical narratives. Through Japanese Canadian redress, I demonstrate how Canada’s Public Accounts re-articulates compensation to survivors as a benevolent act of government and trace such benevolence to (settler)colonial dispositions towards Indigenous populations. Second, through the Common Experience Payment to residential school survivors, I find that compensation application forms and program evaluations are two sites which produce silences about historical injustice and survivors by rearticulating these as service delivery to target populations and for all Canadians. Third, I contend that the liberal and nation-building transitional justice framework, within which reparations are being increasingly conceptualized for addressing Indigenous rights, is incommensurable with reparation in the form of decolonization, despite efforts to articulate it as such. This thesis offers insight into the rationalities of government that are used to address the historical injustice claims of survivors and sounds a voice in the space of the silences which compensation processes produce in the records of the Canadian civil service.</description>

   <description>The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of surface texturing for improving the tribological performance of metal-ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) bearing systems during intermittent stop-dwell-start (SDS) motion. Numerical and experimental studies were conducted to analyze the role of texture parameters for hemispherical segments (dimples) on the tribological characteristics of two lubricated surfaces in contact, with the objective to minimize contact stress in the polymeric component.&#xd;
&#xd;
A finite element study was undertaken to determine the effects of three texture design parameters: dimple diameter, d, dimple centre-to-centre spacing, c, and contact area radius, a. Results indicated that lower stress values were evident in the region between dimples. When dimple features were distributed with the centre-to-centre spacing from 20% to 60% of the dimple diameter, the polymeric contact stress was reduced by 10%-45% compared to the average stress without texturing.&#xd;
&#xd;
In a second study, a computational technique was proposed to calculate the desired dimple stress, σd, for given contact region radius, a, average applied contact load, F, dimple diameter, d, and dimple spacing ratio, c/d. It was demonstrated that an efficient dimple texture design could be realized through an optimal combination of the texture spacing ratio, contact region radius and dimple diameter. It was observed that the contact stress in the plastic region is only dependent on the dimple spacing ratio, c/d, for a given load. However, dimple stress increased as the dimple diameter is enlarged for a fixed contact area and spacing ratio, c/d.&#xd;
&#xd;
In the final study, a method to fabricate textured surfaces is described that uses hot embossing. The protocol was optimized to produce textured test samples that achieve 95.6% of their target dimensions. Pilot studies of pressure distribution under quasi-static load using a flat cylindrical punch show trends consistent with model predictions. &#xd;
&#xd;
The results from this work have clinical relevance in the selection of dimple dimensions and lubrication fluid for application in total joint arthroplasty design. However, future studies should consider the effects of lubricant fluid viscosity and the change in material properties of UHMWPE with hot embossing.</description>

   <title>Analysis of Radio Spectral Indices in the CHANG-ES Galaxy Sample</title>

   <description>The spectral index of a galaxy provides insight on the processes occurring within the galaxy, and can give hints to how the cosmic ray electrons propagate through the galaxy. Band-to-band spectral index maps provide a method for seeing features within a galaxy that are not visible in the in-band spectral index maps due to the increased signal to noise ratio. With data from the CHANG-ES project 126 observed band-to-band spectral index maps have been made from the 35 galaxies in the sample. These maps are created by taking advantage of the matching resolutions of the C-array&#xd;
L-band and D-array C-band data sets, as well as the B-array L-band and C-array C-band sets. The band-to-band spectral index maps assume a straight line in log space from the L-band to the C-band, thus increasing the signal to noise ratio in the maps but ignoring any curvature within the bands. Further, using the method by Vargas et al. (2018), thermal prediction and non-thermal band-to-band spectral index maps have been created for 22 of the 35 galaxies in the CHANG-ES sample. This is the largest set of spatially resolved maps of its kind.&#xd;
From this set of maps we have concluded that the spectral index steepens towards the edges of a galaxy as the cosmic rays propagate away from their source and experience energy losses. We find that nearly all of the galaxies have a mean non-thermal spectral index that falls within the observed range of -0.5 to -1.1. We have also produced some of the clearest images of the jets in NGC 660 that have ever been seen. These jets are not even visible in the total intensity radio maps. The maps produced for this thesis will be released to the public for further analysis in an upcoming data&#xd;
release by the CHANG-ES collaboration.</description>

   <title>Negative Feedback-Seeking in Depression: Examination of Maladaptive Schemas and Rumination as Cognitive Mechanisms, and the Prospective Prediction of Interpersonal Stressful Events</title>

   <description>Coyne’s (1976) interpersonal theory of depression describes a process through which depressed individuals communicate with others such that aversive aspects of their interpersonal behaviour can exacerbate or maintain their depression. Swann’s self-verification theory (Swann, 1983; Swann, 1987) proposes that one such behaviour, negative feedback-seeking (NFS), is the solicitation of negative self-relevant information from others that confirms their negative self-views. Research has demonstrated an association of NFS to depression; however, the cognitive structures that account for this relationship have yet to be empirically tested. In the context of an interpersonal laboratory stressor, the first goal of the present study was to examine the mediating role of rumination and negative self-schemas in the relation of depression to NFS in a sample of 61 participants with diagnosed major depression and 61 non-depressed participants. The second goal was to improve our understanding of how NFS prospectively contributes to negative outcomes – specifically, to interpersonal stress and the exacerbation of depression. Participants underwent a diagnostic interview to determine depression status, and they completed measures of NFS, rumination, negative self-schemas, and depressive symptoms. Participants returned to the lab three months later to complete a contextual interview retrospectively assessing stressful interpersonal events in the interim three-month period and to re-assess depressive symptoms. The results showed that particular negative self-schema domains (i.e., Impaired Limits; and Over-Vigilance &amp; Inhibition) mediated the depression-NFS relation. Rumination was not a significant mediator; however, rumination interacted with the Impaired Limits domain to moderate the significant mediation of Impaired Limits on the relation between depression and NFS, such that the mediation was significant only at moderate and high levels of rumination. With respect to negative outcomes of NFS, the present study did not find that NFS prospectively predicted interpersonal stress, nor did depression (a diagnosis of major depression or baseline depressive symptoms) significantly moderate the relation. Finally, consistent with the hypothesis, NFS significantly prospectively predicted increases in depressive symptoms over time, and these relations were significantly moderated by interpersonal stress exposure. These results are discussed in relation to the findings of previous studies and with regard to limitations of the current study.</description>

   <description>Migmatite-cored gneiss domes in the Himalaya are valuable structures that expose the mid-crust, allowing for the investigation of tectonic and structural processes governing the evolution of the Himalayan orogen. Located in NW Nepal, the Gurla Mandhata core complex exposes the Himalayan Metamorphic Core (HMC), a sequence of high metamorphic-grade gneiss, migmatite, and granite, in the hinterland of the Himalayan orogen. Sm-Nd isotopic analyses indicate that these rocks have both Greater Himalayan sequence (GHS) and Lesser Himalayan sequence (LHS) protolith affinity. In-situ U-Th/Pb monazite petrochronology coupled with petrographic, structural, and microstructural observations reveal that the core complex is composed solely of rocks in the hanging wall of the Main Central Thrust (MCT). Rocks from the core complex record Eocene Eohimalayan and late-Oligocene to early-Miocene Neohimalayan metamorphic pulses (U-Th/Pb monazite age peaks of 40 Ma, 25-19 Ma, and 19-16 Ma) along with a pre-Himalayan Ordovician pulse (ca. 470 Ma). The combination of Sm-Nd isotopic analysis and U-Th/Pb monazite petrochronology demonstrates that both GHS and LHS protolith material is captured in the hanging wall of the MCT and experienced Cenozoic Himalayan metamorphism during south-directed extrusion in west Nepal. Monazite ages do not record metamorphism coeval with late Miocene east-directed exhumation, demonstrating that peak metamorphism and generation of anatectic melt in the core complex had ceased prior to the onset of hinterland orogen-parallel extension at ~15-13 Ma. The geometry of the Gurla Mandhata core complex requires significant hinterland crustal thickening prior to 16 Ma, which is attributed to ductile HMC thickening and footwall accretion of LHS protolith material associated with a ramp-flat MHT geometry below the core complex. The Gurla Mandhata core complex shares many structural and tectonometamorphic characteristics with the North Himalayan domes. This thesis demonstrates that isotopic signatures such as Sm-Nd should only be used to characterize lithotectonic units and structural features across the Himalaya in conjunction with supporting petrochronological and structural data. Further, this thesis highlights the necessity for clear definitions of Himalayan metamorphic rocks that can differentiate between their protolith and tectonometamorphic characteristics.</description>

   <description>The production of biofuels through fermentation has become increasingly important due to the need for sustainable energy sources.  The fermentation processes of ethanol and n-butanol, by Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Clostridium acetobutylicum, respectively, suffer from end-product inhibition, hindering final product concentrations, volumetric productivity, and product recovery. To alleviate these limitations, in-situ product removal (ISPR) methods can be implemented, via two-phase partitioning bioreactor (TPPB) technology.  This work used a polyelectrolyte absorbent phase, poly(vinyldodecylimidazolium bromide) [P(VC12ImBr)], in TPPB systems for the removal of the target molecules, ethanol and n-butanol, with focus on the latter due to more severe product inhibition and its greater promise as a biofuel.  &#xd;
P(VC12ImBr) was synthesized and characterized for ISPR implementation and was found to have a partition coefficient (PC) and selectivity of 1.1 and 7.2 for ethanol, and a PC of 6.5 and selectivity of 46 for n-butanol.  Characteristics of P(VC12ImBr) were found to be favorable for TPPB implementation, including its density, diffusivity for n-butanol, and complete biocompatibility with S. cerevisiae and C. acetobutylicum.  A differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) scan of P(VC12ImBr) found its melting temperature to be -17°C and a glass transition temperature above 200°C, which can be reduced by plasticization with water. Anion exchange between bromide in P(VC12ImBr) and sulphate and phosphate ions in fermentation medium was observed, however this did not affect its PC or selectivity.&#xd;
When implemented in ethanol and acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) ISPR fermentations, P(VC12ImBr) absorbed target molecules from the fermentation broth, however improvements relative to a control were observed only for the ABE fermentation with the mass fraction of sorbent used.  In the ABE ISPR fermentation there was greater substrate conversion and an increase in volumetric productivity of 76%.&#xd;
The water + n-butanol + P(VC12ImBr) ternary system confirmed P(VC12ImBr)’s preference for n-butanol by concentrating dilute solutions above its aqueous solubility limit.  To examine n-butanol absorbed by P(VC12ImBr), a 1.5 wt% n-butanol solution was concentrated to 25 wt% n-butanol, which was thermally removed and condensed to show phase separation. The ability of P(VC12ImBr) to concentrate dilute solutions of n-butanol above its solubility limit would allow for an improved n-butanol purification process.</description>

   <title>Post-Islamism Redefined: A Genealogy of Political Islam in Iran</title>
   <creator>Dokhanchi, Milad</creator>
   <contributor>Husain, Adnan</contributor>
   <subject>Political Islam, Iran, Governmentality, Shi'ism, Post-Islamism, Velayat-e Faqih, Gill Deleuze</subject>
   <description>Challenging the current academic conception of the term “post-Islamism,” this dissertation provides an alternative definition of the concept, having in mind the case of Iran. In contrast to Asef Bayat’s deployment of “post-Islamism,” as a secular rejection of an Islam that informs political consciousness, this dissertation, following Michel Foucault, situates Islamism within a larger genealogy, in order to investigate the relationships between religious and political traditions, from early Islamic eras to modern responses to an emerging Iranian state in the twentieth century. The dissertation specifically argues for a distinction between a statist Islamism and a non-statist understanding of Islam as a political ideology. To interpret this dynamic, Gill Deleuze and Felix Guattari’s characterization of non-statist “war machines” and centralist logics of the State Apparatus, is invoked to help explain how a modernist religious and political ideology and movement like Islamism developed before, during, and after the Islamic Revolution in 1979.  After defining Islamism, through a critical engagement with scholarship on political Islam, the dissertation provides an analysis of the early Islamic antipathy to statism that characterized the community and movement established by the Prophet Muhammad. The dissertation then applies genealogical analysis to the doctrine of velāyat-e faqih that authorized the clerical domination of the Islamic republic. It then examines the formation of the modern nation-state in Iran and the role Iranian Islamism played in its formation and asks questions about how Islamism as a war-machine turned into a State Apparatus. This dissertation then calls for a revival of Islamism and concludes that the consequences of the state appropriation of Islamism have come to necessitate new cultural and political movements which support religious approaches to politics, yet they resist identifying with Islam as an ideology of state domination.  This dissertation, calls the intellectual process of non-statist Islamist revival: post-Islamism.</description>

   <title>Exploration of New Applications of Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICPMS) to Fuel Cell Electrochemistry</title>

   <description>The electrochemically active surface area of catalysts in fuel cells can be increased using nanoparticles (NPs). To assess their stability, the mass concentration and the size of NPs, along with the portion that is dissolved, must be determined. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) allows ultra-trace analysis of solutions and, in single particle (sp) mode, can measure the mass of inorganic NPs in aqueous medium. In fact, if the shape, density and composition of the NPs are known, their masses can be converted into sizes, and a size distribution can then be readily obtained. This thesis presents simple ways to extend the capabilities of ICPMS for the analysis of electrolyte and NPs. &#xd;
Firstly, it demonstrates that spICPMS can accurately characterize synthetic 10-nm Pt NPs and that it nicely complements transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which provides the NPs shape from their two dimensional projection.  For a known shape, spICPMS measures the NPs size distribution much faster than TEM. Secondly, it introduces flow injection (FI) coupled to spICPMS, i.e., FI-spICPMS, which is then validated through the accurate characterization of 60 nm Au NPs standard suspension.  Thirdly, FI-spICPMS is applied for the first time to synthetic Ni NPs and its performance is compared to that of spICPMS, TEM and X-ray diffraction. FI-spICPMS is beneficial over spICPMS as it eliminates the need to measure the transport efficiency and the sample uptake rate in order to determine the mass of NPs. &#xd;
Fourthly, a correction factor to the transport efficiency is proposed to improve the accuracy of spICPMS based on conventional standard solution calibration for ICPMS instruments exhibiting a significant settling time compared to the dwell time used to measure NPs. The suitability of the correction factor is confirmed through the accurate analysis of standard Au NPs. &#xd;
Finally, for the first time, mono-segmented flow analysis (MSFA) is coupled to ICPMS to facilitate the analysis of volume-limited and corrosive samples: 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte collected during cyclic voltammetry under simulated fuel cell conditions and minute amounts of differentially glycosylated purple acid phosphatase glycoforms.  In the latter case, such amounts were insufficient for analysis by analytical service laboratories.</description>

   <title>How Can Game Developers Leverage Data from Online Distribution Platforms? A Case Study of the Steam Platform</title>

   <description>Developing a successful game is challenging. Prior work shows that gamers are extremely difficult to satisfy, making the quality of games an important issue. Prior work has yielded important results from mining data that is available on the online distribution platforms for software applications, helping practitioners save valuable resources, and improving the user-perceived quality of software that is distributed through these platforms. However, much of the work on mining online distribution platforms focuses on mining mobile app stores (e.g., Google Play Store, Apple App Store). Video game development differs from the development of other types of software. Hence, knowledge derived from mining mobile app stores may not be directly applicable to game development.&#xd;
&#xd;
In this Ph.D. thesis, we focused on mining online distribution platforms for games. In particular, we mined data from the Steam platform, the largest digital distribution platforms for PC gaming, with over 23,000 games available and over 184 million active users. More specifically, we analyzed the following four aspects of online distribution for games: urgent updates; the early access model (which enables game developers to sell unfinished versions of their games); user reviews; and user-recorded gameplay videos on the Steam platform. We observed that the choice of update strategy is associated with the proportion of urgent updates that developers have to release. Early access game developers can use the early access model as a method for eliciting early feedback and more positive reviews to attract additional new players. In addition, although negative reviews contain more valuable information for developers, the portion of useful information in positive reviews should not be ignored by developers and researchers. Finally, we proposed an approach for determining the likelihood that a gameplay video demonstrates a game bug, with both a mean average precision at 10 and a mean average precision at 100 of 0.91. Our approach can help game developers leverage readily available gameplay videos to automatically collect otherwise hard-to-gather bug reports for games. The results of our empirical studies highlight the value of mining online distribution platforms for games in offering practical suggestions for game developers.</description>

   <description>Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia affecting more than 33 million individuals worldwide. AF may lead to severe complications associated with disabling symptoms that can reduce health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and exercise performance. Catheter ablation (CA) is currently the mainstay of treatment for symptom amelioration and restoration of sinus rhythm (SR) in patients with symptomatic AF. However, despite improvements in HRQoL, it has yet to be elucidated whether functional improvements post-ablation are related to improvements in physical activity and the relation between arrhythmia burden, exercise volume and intensity remains uncertain.   &#xd;
Methods: Thirty-six patients with symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF undergoing catheter ablation were enrolled. Patients were provided with an accelerometer which recorded and transmitted physical activity over a 7-day period pre- and post-ablation. At baseline and 3-months post-ablation, a 48-hour Holter monitor was performed and a HRQoL survey using the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy-of-life (AFEQT) questionnaire was administered. At 3-months, recurrence was assessed using Holter monitoring and HRQoL evaluation was repeated. &#xd;
Results: Within this patient cohort, 28% were female (mean age 60±10). Of the 36 (60%) patients undergoing catheter ablation for their symptomatic AF, 30 (83%) had successful procedures and no recurrent episodes of AF/atrial flutter (AFL) or atrial tachycardia (AT) at 3-months follow-up, while 6 (17%) patients had unsuccessful procedures. Overall, there was an improvement in exercise volume and intensity for all patients who underwent catheter ablation, irrespective of procedural outcome. However, significant improvements in physical activity correlates were only observed in patients with successful procedures (p=0.03 and p=0.013 for total step count and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), respectively) at follow-up. Overall HRQoL at 3-months was substantially increased for patients without recurrences of arrhythmia (p=0.04) and not receiving antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy (p=0.03). AF type had a significant effect on exercise parameters (total step count p=0.005 and MVPA p=0.02) as well as echocardiographic parameters (LVEF p&lt;0.0001) at 3-months post-ablation. &#xd;
Conclusions: Amongst patients with symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF, successful treatment with CA led to significant improvements in exercise capacity and HRQoL. Further investigation is warranted to confirm these results in the long-term.</description>

   <description>Sculpture is an art form dating back over millennia. More recently, 3D digital sculptures are used in video games, movies, and manufacturing. Traditionally, sculptors have used their hands and tools to shape wood, clay, stone or metal into an art piece. Currently, digital sculpting is accomplished using two dimensional flat screens, mice and keyboards. In this thesis, our goal is to understand how best to combine traditional and digital sculpting interaction techniques. We developed a mixed reality sculpting tool, Virtutello, which allows us to explore this question.  Virtutello allows the user to use their hands to point and sculpt within a mixed virtual digital environment. As well, the user can physically move around the sculpture to see it from different perspectives. In an observational study of 20 participants, we found that users could be trained within thirty minutes and had a moderate degree of success in completing basic sculpting tasks.  &#xd;
We focused our investigation on three main research questions. First, a core of sculpting is the ability to touch and select areas of a sculpture. We investigate the success of two pointing techniques, the novel open-hand pointing and the traditional finger pointing. We found there is an advantage using open hand pointing while sculpting in a mixed reality application. Participants completed tasks faster and with a higher degree of success when using open-hand pointing. Participants also expressed they felt more in control and had less of a challenge while completing tasks using open-hand pointing. Second, operating in a virtual world allows the user to physically move around the sculpture. We investigate whether there is a cost to sculpting while standing versus sitting, finding there is no cost to accuracy and task completion time. Third, we investigated user’s behavior when given this freedom to physically move around the sculpture. &#xd;
We found that participants preferred to remain stationary while sculpting, regardless of whether they were sitting or standing. Instead of moving around to change their perspective, participants preferred to rotate the sculpture digitally in front of them.</description>

   <description>Conventional sources of energy like coal, gas, and oil are being depleted and renewable sources of energy are needed to meet ever-increasing energy demands. Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) like solar and wind can be potentially harnessed, however, high penetration of the RESs will introduce new challenges for the safe operation and control of future grids. To solve this problem, microgrids (MG) can be used to coordinate distributed energy resources in a decentralized fashion in order to ensure the reliability and efficiency of the local distribution network. Recently, there has been a great increase in the number of DC sources and loads leading to a need to develop DC MGs, which are more efficient and less costly. Despite the benefits of DC MGs, there are some challenges that need to be addressed in order to take full advantage of DC MGs and ensure the safe operation of the system under all operating conditions. This thesis proposes a decentralized control solution for energy storage systems (ESSs) in islanded DC MGs, namely a nonlinear adaptive droop controller. In the islanded mode of operation, the tight regulation of the DC-bus voltage is very challenging. The proposed decentralized control technique utilizes a nonlinear adaptive droop profile with adaptive parameters, which are able to regulate the DC-bus voltage tightly during various changes in loads/sources within a DC MG. The proposed controller does not need to identify between the charge and discharge operation modes. The adaptive control parameters can be determined by using three different strategies. In the first strategy, only one of two adaptive parameters in each mode of operation (charge and discharge modes) is unknown, which is determined from a look-up table. In the second strategy, a nonlinear Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) optimization technique is employed to derive the adaptive parameters. The proposed technique adaptively regulates the controller parameters according to the battery’s SoC and the DC MG voltage. In the third strategy, the fast charge and discharge voltages are assumed to be known. In this approach another droop controller, which is called the speed-droop controller derives the unknown parameters. The stability of the proposed control schemes is proven in this thesis, and the validity of the proposed schemes is proven through simulation and experimental results.</description>

   <description>To succeed and thrive in different environments, individuals can express plastic phenotypes, including life history traits, to ensure some level of fitness across conditions. As such, the plasticity of traits is central to understanding how individuals cope with the challenges associated with variable environmental conditions. Previous work has described how several traits relevant to fitness respond to different temperatures, but much of this work has focused on only one or a few traits and overlooked interactions between traits. Few have considered the effects of temperature on parental care – a highly flexible trait that can have important effects on fitness and might buffer offspring from environmental challenges. Here, we investigated the plasticity of life history traits, including parental care, in the burying beetle Nicrophorus orbicollis, which exbibits biparental care. We took an integrative approach to study how organisms cope with temperature variation. We conducted a captive experiment to characterize the family-level reaction norms of several life history traits across temperatures. We found that life history traits showed varying levels of plasticity, and some traits exhibited family-level variation in reaction norms, which might reflect underlying heritable variation in plasticity. We also found that parental care buffered some but not all effects of temperature on fitness in N. orbicollis. Contrary to expectations, offspring size did not change across temperatures. Our findings suggest that N. orbicollis cope with challenging warmer temperatures by reducing brood size to provide higher levels of care per larva such that offspring eclose at a similar size regardless of temperature. Taken together, our results show that life history responses to different temperatures reflect the incorporation of several reaction norms, which vary among families and have important fitness consequences.</description>

   <description>Au cours de ce travail, dans une première approche descendante, nous avons étudié la réalisation de cellules solaires multicouches évaporées à base de matériaux organiques : le pentacène et le PTCDI-C5. Nous nous somme servis de cela pour bâtir des cellules simple jonction bicouches et les caractériser. Ces cellules ont servi de modèle de référence à notre étude et démontrent des capacités en accord avec la littérature. Nous avons ensuite produit et caractérisé des cellules multijonctions en bicouches. Une rapide étude sur le comportement d’une couche d’argent d’épaisseur nanométrique a servi à déposer la couche de recombinaison de ces cellules. Nous nous sommes ensuite attelés à la réalisation de monocouches auto-assemblées sur silicium dans le but de développer des couches actives donneur-accepteur et de pouvoir les empiler par l’approche ascendante. Après avoir étudié les groupements d’accroche silanes et acide phosphoniques, nous avons investigué la réalisation de SAM de  (3-Triméthoxysilylpropyl) diéthylènetriamine (DETAS) sur silicium en tant que d’accroche pour les molécules actives. Nous avons mis en évidence la présence de liaisons hydrogènes aidant à l’organisation de la SAM grâce à des analyse ATR-FTIR. Nous nous sommes servis de cette SAM comme couche d’accroche pour la greffe une molécule photo-active le pérylène tétracarboxylique dianhydride (PTCDA). Les techniques de caractérisation par AFM, ellipsométrie et spectroscopie Raman nous ont servi à caractériser notre surface après la greffe de PTCDA.</description>

   <description>Vehicular crowdsensing aims to utilize the plethora of onboard sensors and resources on smart vehicles to gather sensing data in a large coverage area. Due to vehicles’ predictable mobility, roadside service providers can use vehicles’ announced trajectories to recruit vehicles to provide sensing data for a coverage area. Existing works have utilized optimization models to obtain optimal solutions. Heuristic recruitment algorithms aim to obtain an approximate solution which runs in polynomial time. In this thesis, we propose several heuristic recruitment algorithms for a variety of vehicular crowdsensing problem formulations. We first explore the temporal vehicle recruitment problem where we recruit vehicles all travelling in the same direction on one road over time. We propose a heuristic recruitment algorithm to compare to an existing optimal framework and heuristic, and achieve better coverage at lower recruitment costs than the existing heuristic. We also prove that the existing heuristic can be arbitrarily bad in the worst case. We then consider the spatiotemporal vehicular recruitment problem where we recruit from vehicles moving freely in a two dimensional space. We propose a new optimal framework for obtaining optimal solutions, as well as a heuristic which we compare to an existing heuristic. Our performance evaluations show that we outperform the existing heuristic in terms of recruiter utility as well as recruitment cost. We also propose a new variation of the vehicular recruitment problem that considers a two dimensional coverage area with certain subsets of area having increased priority. We propose both an optimal model as well as a heuristic for obtaining approximate solutions, which in our performance evaluations on small numbers of vehicles, achieves coverage near optimal at only slightly more expensive recruitment costs. Finally, we consider the heterogeneous or multi sensor vehicular recruitment problem, where vehicles have multiple sensor types and areas of coverage require a certain sensor type to be covered. We propose an optimal model and heuristic for this problem, and again show in performance evaluations that the heuristic returns solutions close to optimal in scenarios with small numbers of vehicles.</description>

   <title>Characterizing the Role of the RET Receptor Tyrosine Kinase in Colorectal Cancer</title>

   <description>RET is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that plays important roles in both normal development and cancer. RET has well-established oncogenic roles in thyroid cancer and growing evidence implicates RET activity in the development and progression of other tumor types, including pancreatic and breast cancer. RET is activated by interacting with its ligand, a member of the GDNF family, and a co-receptor, a member of the GFRα family. This tri-molecular complex activates RET-mediated downstream signaling pathways which promote a variety of cellular processes, including proliferation, migration, and survival. RTK-mediated activation of these pathways is an established method of colorectal cancer (CRC) development and progression to a metastatic phenotype. RET expression has been identified in CRC, however its role in this disease remains unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of RET activity in CRC. We first developed a novel in vitro method for generating and using 3D cell spheroids as a more physiologically representative assessment of cell behaviour compared to traditional 2D methodologies. We subsequently used this model in our study of RET-mediated CRC progression. We showed that RET activity in CRC cells promotes a more mesenchymal-like phenotype, and enhances cell proliferation, migration, and 3D invasion. We also assessed RET expression in two CRC patient cohorts. RET expression was correlated with malignancy and poor patient prognosis. Together, our data suggest an oncogenic role for RET in CRC which may be of future interest as a potential therapeutic target.</description>

   <description>Incense has been an integral part of Chinese culture since before the introduction of Buddhism in the third century B.C.E. A rise in the popularity of Buddhist practice marked an increase in the importation, production, and use of incense in China. Incense was used for everything from acting as an aid in the most mundane activities, like telling time, to accomplishing the most extraordinary activities, like helping Buddhist practitioners achieve instant enlightenment. Yet, despite incense being a seemingly integral part of Chinese history and culture the government has created a policy limiting the use of incense in Buddhist temples. “Tracing Incense: The Affective Power of Objects” asks the question: what can be gained by introducing new materialism and affect theory to religious studies research? Specifically, how can embodied, sensory observations of incense in four Buddhist temples in Shanghai enrich our understanding of contemporary Chinese Buddhism? There is scholarship discussing the role of material objects in religion, as well as scholarship introducing affect theory to religious studies but there is little to no writing that brings religious studies into conversation with both new materialism and affect theory to investigate what each theoretical model lends to the other and to the greater study of religion. To illustrate how material and affect based research can be helpful in developing the field of religious studies, I will share my observations of incense in four Buddhist temples in Shanghai that I gathered while conducting sound and smellwalks. I will analyze my data using concepts from new materialism and affect theory. I will move past my observations to think about the socio-political entanglements that incense, and Chinese Buddhism are enmeshed in. I will argue that the limitation of the use of incense in Buddhist temples in an effort to control, monitor, and reduce religious practices. “Tracing Incense: The Affective Power of Objects” will conclude by arguing that introducing new materialism and affect theory to religious studies offers new and exciting ways of learning about the complexities of lived traditions.</description>

   <description>Preferential flow pathways and hydraulic gradients along the hillslope-floodplain-channel continuum are dominant controls on the delivery of baseflow, stormflow and solutes to channels in temperate systems. Arctic systems are increasingly being shown to possess similar delivery mechanisms, however the topic is understudied, acutely so in the High Arctic. This work assesses the nature of delivery mechanisms in the High Arctic over the thaw season and in response to rainfall at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory (CBAWO). Two locations of persistent preferential subsurface inputs were observed over a 200 m section the study reach, one at the outlet of a previously active channel through the floodplain, and another at the outlet of a channelized sub-catchment. During baseflow, these inputs provided solute-rich, relatively cold water to streamflow. During stormflow, subsurface inputs remain active and in the case of the sub-catchment, there was evidence for increased flux of pre-event soil water. Over the 320 m study reach, heterogeneity in the nature of hydraulic gradients, in how gradients developed over the season, and in how gradients responded to rainfall was observed. Two monitored hydraulic gradients exhibited reversal of inferred flow direction; one due to rainfall and the other as the thaw season progressed.&#xd;
&#xd;
Economic feasibility of hydrological investigations concerning total dissolved solids and electrical conductivity (EC) becomes an issue when spatial and temporal scales increase, especially when the objective is to capture the variability inherent within aquatic systems. Chapin et al. (2014) presented a modified version of the Onset HOBO Pendant waterproof temperature and light logger with the ability to assess relative EC, however it was not dimensional EC (i.e. µS/cm). This work demonstrates these economical loggers can be calibrated and applied to quantify EC in the field with accuracies comparable to commercial loggers.</description>

   <description>The pursuit of creating valuable learning experiences for adolescents is a complex challenge. The purpose of this study is to explore the experiences of a group of disengaged and disenchanted adolescents. I identified a gap in the literature; youth are often only quoted for comments affirming that interventions have been beneficial. The present study seeks to fill this gap by representing as directly as possible the experiences of participants that relate to their motivation and engagement. To investigate the processes at work that contribute to the general decline in motivation that occurs in early adolescence (Gottfried, Flemming &amp; Gottfried, 2001; Harter, 1981; Whitlock, 2006), and that for some result in definitive disengagement with formal education, I used art elicitation to facilitate the communication of various experiences of school by one group of urban self-identified disengaged and disenchanted adolescents. The data were analyzed using traditional qualitative methods, as well as poetic inquiry, which offers aesthetic representations of reflexive research methods and meditations on significant themes and topics in the data. The visual and written data provide rich information about contemporary experiences of secondary school for the disengaged and disenchanted adolescent participants and inform a discussion of recommendations and personal discoveries.</description>

   <title>Damage Threshold of Near-Cross-Ply and Angle-Ply Tubes Used in Concrete Filled FRP Tubes Loaded in Flexure</title>

   <description>Concrete-filled fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) tubes (CFFTs) have been studied extensively, but a lingering question remains regarding the vulnerability of the exposed tube to accidental damage or vandalism.  In this thesis, the effect of damage induced in the tubes on the flexural strength of CFFTs is studied. Two commonly available types of tubes are explored, one with near-cross-ply having nearly orthogonal fibre arrangements, and one with large (±55°) angle-ply fibre arrangements. Eighteen CFFTs using the former tube and twelve CFFTs using the latter tube were tested in four-point bending, including undamaged control specimens to establish their full nominal strength (Mno). Full wall thickness cuts were introduced in the glass-FRP tubes in the circumferential and longitudinal directions, on both the tension and compression sides.  The cuts also varied in length, as a ratio of the outer perimeter πD, and their proximity to neutral axis was varied for one type of tubes.  It is shown that the most critical cut for both tubes is the circumferential one on extreme tension side. The reduced-to-control ultimate moment ratio (Mn/Mno) of the angle-ply CFFTs reduces almost linearly from 1.0 to 0.36 as the cut length increases from zero to 20% (πD). This is much less critical than in near-cross-ply CFFTs, where (Mn/Mno) drops sharply from 1.0 to 0.55 at a 2% (πD) cut, then gradually to 0.25 at a 20% (πD) cut. The maximum difference between angle-ply and near-cross-ply CFFTs seems to occur around the 10% (πD) cut, where (Mn/Mno) ratio of the near-cross-ply CFFT is only half that of angle-ply CFFT. As the location of a 3% (πD) circumferential cut shifted from extreme tension to an 80° angular location from the bottom of a near-cross-ply CFFT, (Mn/Mno) increased from 0.52 to 1.0. Longitudinal tension cuts caused (Mn/Mno) to drop linearly from 1.0 to 0.47 at a 22% (πD) cut length, which was similar for both tubes.  Compression side longitudinal and circumferential cuts were less critical with (Mn/Mno) being 0.8 to 0.9. For practical design purposes, a case study based on ultimate static strength showed that CFFTs similar to the ones tested in this study can tolerate a circumferential tension cut up to 30% (πD), for both tube types, before they have to be taken out of service or repaired.</description>

   <description>This contribution investigates the synthesis and characterization of nickel and nickel hydroxide-based materials with intended applications as electrode materials and electrocatalysts in clean, renewable energy technologies. A diverse range of nickel-based nanostructures are studied to identify candidates with high surface area and significant electrocatalytic activities towards the relevant hydrogen and oxygen redox reactions. The structures studied in this work include nickel hydroxide nanocages, nickel-based layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles, and nickel-based mesoporous metal oxides (MMO). To evaluate these materials, a complete characterization of the synthesized nanostructures is presented, comprising a combination of thermal analyses, surface science techniques and electrochemical analyses to gain a fundamental understanding of their chemical composition and structural features. Based on these results, we propose a tunable methodology for the preparation of nickel-based LDH nanoparticles including various historically relevant, hybrid nickel materials (i.e. Ni-Al, Ni-Zn, Ni-Fe, etc.). Tripodal ligands are applied in this technique to act as particle growth control agents, resulting in the successful isolation of nanoparticles as small as 30 nm and 15 nm (diameter), in the cases of Ni and Ni-Fe, respectively. Assembly of these nanoparticles into larger mesoporous structures was also performed using a soft polymer-templating method, and a comprehensive overview of this technique is presented. Successful conversion of hybrid nickel hydroxide nanoparticles to the corresponding mesoporous nickel oxide was confirmed by electron microscopy and electrochemical measurements. The foundation for further exploration of a vast series of nickel hydroxide and nickel oxide functional nanomaterials is established based on the novel research presented in this work.</description>

   <description>Other than at his birthplace in Pittsburgh Township, Ontario, and his lived-in community of North Bay, Ontario, Thomas Clarence Cummings (T.C.) is a relatively unknown presence in the collectivity of those who have contributed to the representation of Canadian identity at the community, regional, and national levels. Cummings left us a prolific number of statements in several media communicating how he perceived who we were as Canadians in the twentieth century. These are examined through an analysis of several stages in T.C.’s “life-path”: as a youngster on a farm in Pittsburgh Township and as a student in a one-room schoolhouse on Woodburn Road; as a young man in North Bay pursuing a career in education and the initiation of a life-long commitment to international travel; as a volunteer in World War II serving in Atlantic Canada; on his return to teach in North Bay and the resumption of his travels worldwide; as a retired teacher, an active artist, and social critic producing reflexive commentaries on society in a modern and post-modern world. In particular, Cummings’ journals, poems, and artwork are connected to his travels and his commentaries about our evolving Canadian identity and our relationship with a global society. His later allegorical paintings, poetry, and writings expressed his assessment of how Canadian society was being affected by modernity and globalization during his life-time. This thesis examines Cummings’ various messages to demonstrate his appreciation of the complexity of the social landscape in his time, and concludes with an assessment of the significance of his contributions in the context of current priorities and concerns in Canadian society today.</description>

   <description>Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death in women in Canada. Lumpectomy and brachytherapy are treatments of choice for early stage breast cancer, but the soft nature of the breast makes it difficult to deliver accurate treatment to the intended sites. Navigation systems offer improved accuracy, reduced cost, and reduced time requirement. Unfortunately navigation systems are still limited because anatomy can move relative to the body. This thesis makes three contributions to this area.&#xd;
&#xd;
In navigated lumpectomy, the tumour is tracked rigidly relative to a tracked needle. However, no rigid relationship exists and the needle can spin in place around the tumour, resulting in erroneous tracking. I propose a method to isolate different types of change in position and orientation, then apply it to computationally compensate for lack of a physical rotation constraint. A phantom study shows that this method improved tumour tracking by 15\% of its volume over the existing method. Fewer degrees of freedom are required, enabling smaller and more affordable hardware to be used.&#xd;
&#xd;
Navigated lumpectomy can rely on a technician's presence. This contributes to cost and crowding in the operating room. I propose to reduce reliance on the technician by delegating display-related tasks to a computer. Two methods are discussed - one to allow the surgeon to point an instrument to create their desired view, and one to automatically center the view on the target. Experiments show these methods eliminate over 100 manual interactions required by the technician in navigated lumpectomy.&#xd;
&#xd;
Beast brachytherapy is a technically-demanding soft tissue intervention that requires precise catheter placement. I propose an electromagnetic navigation system that consists of a tracked needle guide and a small sensor for catheter reconstruction. Phantom experiments show that needles can be placed more accurately when using the tracked needle guide compared to ultrasound guidance. Catheter reconstruction is shown to be accurate within 0.6 mm relative to computed tomography.&#xd;
&#xd;
In conclusion, I have made synergistic contributions toward navigation in soft tissue surgery and brachytherapy. These contributions have been demonstrated in various experiments for two different procedures.</description>

   <title>Access to Primary Health Care Services for Persons with Physical Disabilities in Rural Ghana</title>

   <description>Background: A growing body of evidence has shown that persons with physical disabilities experience substantial barriers in accessing primary health care (PHC) services in rural areas. Negative attitudes from health care providers and inaccessible health care facilities and equipment are common experiences that negatively affect access to quality health care for persons with physical disabilities. However, there is limited research that explores this issue in rural Ghana. Objective: I carried out this dissertation in three chapters to address this research gap. Chapter 3 synthesized published literature to understand the factors affecting access to PHC for persons with disabilities (PWDs) in rural areas globally. Chapter 4 explored the experiences of persons with physical disabilities in accessing PHC services in rural Ghana. Chapter 5 highlighted the perspectives of health care providers in delivering PHC services to persons with physical disabilities in rural Ghana. Method:  I employed framework synthesis and used framework analyses to analyze existing literature (chapter 3). I also used a qualitative descriptive design to conduct semi-structured interviews with 18 persons with physical disabilities (chapter 4) and 15 health care providers (chapter 5).  I used thematic analysis to guide the analysis of the interviews. Results: In chapter 3, I found that PWDs were unable to access PHC due to obstacles including the interplay of four major factors; availability, acceptability, geography and affordability. Chapter 4 revealed that participants shared their experiences under two overarching themes: limited facilities and lack of providers. Chapter 5 uncovered three major themes: challenges in providing health care; strategies in navigating the challenges; and positive experiences in providing health care. Implications: The information provided in this dissertation is potentially important to policy makers and PHC providers as it presents evidence on the barriers and facilitators to PHC access in rural settings. In particular, understanding this topic from multiple sources (existing literature, PWDs and providers) will be critical for policy design and client-centered service delivery in rural Ghana and potentially other low- and middle-income countries.</description>

   <description>This thesis presents a new control architecture tailored for single-phase Microgrids (MGs) operating in the islanded mode. The main feature of the proposed control architecture is its capability to improve the transient performance of the MG components, to have autonomous operation, to compensate for harmonics, and to offer a tight regulation of the voltage across the load. The presented control architecture includes a converter-level controller as well as a supervisory-level controller. The proposed converter-level controller is able to significantly improve the transient performance.&#xd;
The converter-level control includes new power estimator, which can accurately estimate the active and reactive power values very fast. Thus, the transient performance is significantly improved. In addition, the converter-level controller includes&#xd;
a new harmonic compensation system in order to deal with harmonics. The harmonic compensation system includes a hybrid load observer. The hybrid load observer is able to estimate both the harmonics component and the linear components of the load. Thus, the hybrid load observer allows the harmonic compensation system to detect, estimate, and compensate for various load harmonics and disturbances caused by nonlinear loads in MGs (e.g. synchronous and asynchronous harmonics, and DC components). The proposed harmonic compensation system can substantially increase the reliability of MGs in the islanded mode of operation where nonlinear/linear loads produce asynchronous/synchronous harmonics. The other main contribution of this thesis is a novel supervisory-level controller for power converters in MGs. The proposed supervisory-level control scheme further enhances the reliability and transient performance of MGs by providing predictive features to control systems. This predictive feature is produced by a new dynamic controller block, which sets the parameters for the grid-side controller and the ones for the source-side controller. The supervisory-level controller effectively harmonizes the source-side controller and the load-side controller in order to improve the transient performance and stability of MGs. The converter-level controller along with the supervisory-controller provide a very&#xd;
reliable solution for MGs in order to deal with nonlinear loads and perform precise power flow control. Mathematical analysis, simulation and experimental results verify the feasibility of the proposed control techniques and demonstrate their superior performance.</description>

   <description>The field of health promotion advocates a socioecological approach to health which addresses a wide variety of physical, social, environmental, political and cultural factors. Encouraging a holistic approach, health promotion examines many aspects of health and well-being, including physical, mental, sexual, community, social and ecological health. Despite this holism, there is a noticeable absence of discussion surrounding spirituality and spiritual health in the discipline of health promotion. For this thesis project, I was interested in exploring how leading scholars in the field of health promotion, in Canada, understand the place of spirituality in health promotion. Using the fourth edition of Health Promotion in Canada (Rootman et al., 2017) as my sampling frame of recognized leaders in the field, I conducted thirteen semi-structured qualitative interviews with authors from the book. Situated within a critical health promotion approach which utilizes methodologies aiming for social justice, equity and ecological sustainability, I intend to open up possibilities for centering spiritual epistemologies and other ways of knowing that have been marginalized, such as Indigenous understandings of health and wellbeing. I argue that by avoiding spirituality within health promotion frameworks and education, the secularism of health promotion and its underlying values of Eurocentric knowledge production and science remain invisible and rarely critiqued. The absence of spirituality in health promotion signifies the ongoing colonialism of the field. This must be addressed if health promotion is to respond effectively to the calls to action from the Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission (2015), and if health promotion is to fulfill its promise of being inclusive, relevant and effective.</description>

   <title>Novel Methods of Factor VIII Tolerance Induction in Hemophilia A Mouse Models</title>
   <creator>Georgescu, Maria</creator>
   <contributor>Lillicrap, David</contributor>
   <subject>Hemophilia A, Factor VIII, inhibitors</subject>
   <description>The most serious complication of factor VIII (FVIII) replacement therapy in hemophilia A (HA) patients remains the development of anti-FVIII antibodies (inhibitors). At this time, there are no methods to prevent inhibitor development and immune tolerance induction (ITI) therapy is difficult and expensive to administer. As such, novel approaches to establish FVIII tolerance are of great interest.&#xd;
The presence of pro-inflammatory signals during early FVIII exposure has been identified as a risk factor for inhibitor development. Here we demonstrate that in HA mice, administration of a corticosteroid to pharmacologically suppress such signals during initial exposure to FVIII leads to antigen-specific tolerance durable for a minimum of 18 weeks. This was associated with a short-term increase in the proportion of thymic regulatory T cells and changes in thymic genes responsible for immune regulation. &#xd;
Failure to establish central FVIII tolerance is also thought to contribute towards inhibitor development in HA patients. This process begins in the fetal period and therefore requires in utero exposure to the protein via transplacental transfer. Our data suggest that FVIIIFc, a novel fusion protein composed of FVIII and the Fc region of immunoglobulin G1, can undergo transplacental transfer in HA mice. However, the resultant in utero exposure offered minimal protection from inhibitor development later in life, and did so only in the context of HA mice that also lacked VWF. &#xd;
FVIIIFc has also been associated with decreased immunogenicity and improved ITI performance when compared to conventional FVIII. We provide a potential molecular basis for this observation by showing the ability of FVIIIFc to engage the inhibitory FcγRIIB receptor of FVIII-exposed murine B cells. The protein was also able to induce suppressive downstream signaling such as increased SHIP phosphorylation, decreased ERK phosphorylation and decreased calcium flux in FVIII-exposed but not naïve murine B cells.&#xd;
The work presented here provides preclinical evidence of three novel approaches to FVIII tolerance induction and increases our understanding of FVIII immunology.</description>

   <title>Modification of Polysaccharides and their Use as Pickering Emulsifiers in Oil/Water Emulsions, Miniemulsion, and Microsuspension Polymerization</title>

   <description>Emulsion and suspension systems are the basis for the formulation of a wide variety of products including pharmaceuticals, consumables such as food, personal care or cosmetics and commodity materials such as adhesives, paints or synthetic rubbers. These systems require surface active agents (surfactants) or emulsifiers to prevent phase separation. Conventional emulsifiers are derived from petroleum and can entail disadvantages such as ecotoxicity, skin irritation issues or formulation foaming problems, so the design of new emulsifiers that are biodegradable, non-toxic and, at the same time superior in performance, is worthwhile. Pickering emulsifiers (PE) obtained from polysaccharides are a promising new type of emulsion stabilizer and are the focus of this work. &#xd;
First, the hydrophobization of polysaccharide-based materials was investigated. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) were grafted with CO2-responsive polymers prepared by and grafted via reversible-deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP). The effect of the graft molecular weight on the graft density was investigated in detail and was shown to have a direct influence on the dispersion behavior of the grafted CNC. The results suggested that a particular pKaH, minimum graft density and graft length are required to effectively switch the CNC from a hydrophilic to a hydrophobic state. Graft molecular weights of ~5-10 kg/mol and graft densities between 2-6 x 10-2 chains/nm2 yielded CO2-switchable CNC which shuttled reversibly into the organic phase under N2 and into the aqueous phase under CO2. The modified polysaccharides were then employed to stabilize oil- water emulsions and in subsequent polymerizations. The surface and interfacial properties of the PE, the shelf life stability and droplet sizes of the miniemulsions were studied in detail. The chain length of the grafted polymer, the graft densities, the degree of substitution and the concentration of PE were correlated to the properties of the final Pickering emulsions. The type of initiator and type of PE was shown to directly affect the miniemulsion and microsuspension polymerization kinetics, polymer particle size, and molecular weight distribution. It was found that very small amounts of PE are required to give stable emulsions, which, along with the sustainability aspect, could make these materials highly attractive for industrial applications.</description>

   <title>An Examination of Personal Financial Literacy Teaching and Learning in Ontario High Schools</title>

   <description>The purpose of the study was to examine the experiences of current high school students, teachers, and high school graduates in Ontario regarding their experiences with personal financial curriculum and teaching at the secondary level, and to identify the ways in which this important educational experience may have helped prepare students to become financially literate. I sought to examine how helpful and productive financial literacy teaching and curriculum were at preparing students to confidently address personal financial issues they would inevitably face. I considered this overarching issue using a transdisciplinary lens from the perspective of the three stakeholder groups. Using a case study research design, the first of its kind in Ontario or Canada on this topic, I utilized interviews, artifacts, and surveys to uncover student and teacher experiential data across three high schools and two institutions of higher learning in southeastern Ontario. For the interviews and artifacts, there were 12 students and 12 teachers from three high schools. For the high school graduate surveys, there were 344 participants, drawn from one college and one university. Inductive thematic analysis was used for the interviews and artifacts; descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were used for the surveys, with some significance testing. The major findings were that current students and high school graduates perceived curriculum and teaching experiences as seriously lacking in effectively preparing them to be financially literate, and that a fundamental reorientation around transdisciplinary, student-led learning was key to transforming such learning into a more meaningful and valuable educational experience. The central finding from the teacher perspective was that such instruction should be mandated, properly supported and largely student-led; reaffirming the view that greater student learning, meaning and value were achievable with suitable enactment. Accordingly, the three stakeholder groups shared the view that curriculum and teaching in the area of personal financial literacy was largely absent and/or ineffective at meeting student interests and needs. With mandatory, properly supported, student-oriented (transdisciplinary) instruction, the potential exists for more effective and valuable learning, resulting in better equipped high school students that were properly prepared to successfully navigate financial issues and the path ahead.</description>

   <title>Screening Assessments for Aquatic Invasive Species Using Species Distribution Models</title>

   <description>Invasive species are a major cause of biodiversity loss in North American freshwaters. Once established, aquatic invasive species (AIS) can restructure food webs and change the abiotic or physical conditions of a water body. The ability of species distribution models (SDMs) to predict habitat suitability for AIS is of interest because they can be used to identify what species are likely to establish if introduced. Habitat suitability from SDMs could be used as a screening risk assessment to identify which species require more detailed risk assessments. However, SDM performance in areas that are spatially disjunct from their training has been understudied, specifically for aquatic species. I conducted two studies to assess the applicability of habitat suitability predictions created by SDMs to identify potentially invasive fish for further risk assessments. First, I compared the performance of three different SDM techniques (BIOCLIM, DOMAIN and, MaxEnt) for five different freshwater fishes (common carp Cyprinus carpio,burbot Lota lota, northern pike Esox lucius, lake trout Salvelinus namaycush, and brown trout Salmo trutta) when models were trained east of the Atlantic Ocean and evaluated in North America. DOMAIN models were best able to predict the potential distribution of fishes, but still broadly overpredicted the realized distribution of fishes. In areas with habitat conditions that were novel compared to training habitat conditions, predictions of habitat suitability were unreliable for all models.  Based on the information from my first study, I applied the DOMAIN SDM technique to 44 fishes considered an invasion risk to the Laurentian Great Lakes to determine if habitat suitability could be used to identify fishes that are unlikely to invade. No fishes could be removed from consideration as potential invaders based solely on habitat suitability because of large areas of novel habitat conditions. Using habitat suitability as a screening measure to select fishes for further assessment is a questionable process due to uncertainties when predicting in novel habitat conditions and broad overpredictions of fishes’ realized distributions. Instead, trends in habitat suitability should be used to help identify where pathways intersect high habitat suitability for many species.</description>

   <title>PDMS-Containing Polyurethane Forumulation for Anti-Smudge Coatings and Superhydrophobic Textiles</title>

   <description>Durable and transparent anti-smudge coatings that repel both water- and oil-borne contaminants have many potential applications.  Perfluorinated moieties were commonly used in the past to prepare water- and oil-repellant coatings, however these species are expensive and of significant environmental concern.   Further, organic solvents have been traditionally used to formulate such coatings, however such solvent-based coating formulations emit volatile organic compounds and are a safety hazard. &#xd;
First reported in this thesis is the development of transparent and durable water-borne anti-smudge polyurethane coatings.  These coatings are obtained by casting micellar solutions of a blocked polyisocyanate dispersed in water using a graft copolymer, polyol-g-PDMS, where the polyol backbone is water soluble and PDMS denotes poly(dimethyl siloxane).  On these coatings, small 5-µL droplets of various liquids such as cooking and engine oils have no problem to glide cleanly off at substrate tilting angles &lt; 5 °.  Artificial fingerprint liquids, inks, and paints readily shrink into tiny droplets after application on them and their residues after solvent evaporation are readily wiped off with a tissue.  Such waterborne coating formulations were also used to coat textile fibers, where they imparted superhydrophobic properties to the textiles.  For both systems, the challenges associated with switching from a solvent-based to a water-based formulation for the targeted coatings will be discussed.  The greenness of the coating formation process will also be highlighted for its practical value. &#xd;
In the future work, poorer water sliding behavior of NP-GLIDE coating (coatings bear nano-pools of grafted lubricating ingredient for dewetting enablement) will be improved with in-situ formation of free photo-cleavage PDMS chains.  Also, the effect of chain length of PDMS to anti-smudge properties will be systematically investigated.  Further, the robustness of these coatings will be tested.</description>

   <description>Aiming is the act of directing an action toward a target object, location, or direction. Many activities in games require aiming. In order for players to perform these activities successfully, they must be able to aim accurately. When an action is too challenging, the player can become frustrated. Players that are not able to aim accurately enough to perform an action well can be helped through in game systems called aim assistance algorithms. However, it can be challenging to identify how to appropriately assist players. Additionally, it can be difficult to determine how much assistance is required for individual players.&#xd;
We have developed a novel taxonomy to classify aimed actions in games. The taxonomy classifies an aimed action based on its immediacy, target interaction, and embodiment. The classification can be used to inform the design of appropriate aim assistance algorithms.&#xd;
We used this taxonomy to classify aimed actions in three games. Then, based on this classification we designed aim assistance algorithms for each game. We ran two experiments to evaluate these aim assistance algorithms by simulating players of varying skill levels. Our first experiment established a linear relationship between the level of assistance given to a player and their performance of an aimed action. This linear relationship allowed us to personalize our aim assistance algorithms for different skill levels.&#xd;
The second experiment compared the effectiveness of personalized aim assistance algorithms to giving all players the same level of assistance. Personalizing the aim assistance algorithms resulted in players finishing rounds of games with closer scores.&#xd;
This thesis highlights the importance understanding aiming so that players with different abilities can receive personalized support. Additionally, it also shows that personalizing assistance algorithms can result in more balanced game difficulty.</description>

   <title>Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarkers for Early Prostate Cancer</title>

   <description>Prostate cancer is diagnosed and treated primarily on the basis of histopathological assessment of biopsies and cancer extent. Unfortunately, this assessment, performed by pathologists on very small amounts of biopsy tissue, misrepresents patient’s true risk of having life-threatening cancer grade by as much as 50%. Hence there is an urgent need for robust diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers that can accurately identify patients with prostate cancer and stratify them according to the risk of developing aggressive disease state. We addressed this issue by focusing on DNA methylation, and PTEN and ERG protein markers in a large biomarker study. &#xd;
&#xd;
During this study we overcame several technical challenges associated with a typical biomarker discovery/validation approach such as cohort development and sample collection, and recovery of high-quality nucleic acids from archival tissues for proper testing of selected molecular features in downstream analysis. There is emerging evidence supporting a role of DNA methylation in initiation and progression of prostate cancer. We assessed DNA methylation levels at 15 loci using methylation-specific PCR and measured differences in their abundance levels in benign and cancer tissue samples. Several DNA methylation alterations were found to be highly cancer-specific, and a subset of them were significantly associated with prostate cancer grade group and biochemical recurrence.&#xd;
&#xd;
Loss of the PTEN tumor suppressor is a powerful prognostic biomarker in prostate cancer. However, the significance of tumour heterogeneity and partial PTEN loss are not clearly defined, nor are interactions between PTEN loss and the TMPRSS2-ERG fusions, the most common genetic aberration found in prostate cancer.  We investigated their prognostic utility using immunohistochemistry. PTEN loss, but not ERG fusion, was significantly associated with biochemical recurrence. In addition, quantitative assessment of PTEN protein loss showed more prognostic relevance than conventional binary assessment. By conducting thorough assessment of DNA methylation alterations, and genetic mutations involving PTEN and ERG, we provide necessary evidence needed to demonstrate the prognostic utility of these markers.</description>

   <description>This thesis is aimed at exploring new diverse approaches for improving the analytical performance of inductively coupled plasma (ICP) optical emission spectrometry (OES) with pneumatic nebulization (PN) or electrothermal vaporization (ETV).&#xd;
      First, a new infrared (IR)-heated PN system was developed to enhance sample transport efficiency and concurrently improve sensitivity, detection limit and plasma robustness of ICPOES. A cyclonic spray chamber was modified so as to insert an IR lamp heater inside it. The modified cyclonic (MC) spray chamber was heated up to 150 °C. Using a pre-evaporation tube (PET) between the MC spray chamber and the plasma torch was also investigated. Under optimum operating conditions, a 2-5 fold improvement in sensitivity and 2-7 fold improvement in detection limit were achieved for 26 elements compared to conventional PN at room temperature.&#xd;
      Second, the analytical performance of ICPOES was improved by IR heating of commercially available spray chambers using different types of IR heaters, namely ceramic block and ceramic beaded IR heaters. For 29 elements, the detection limit improved by, on average, 2-3 fold with the rope heater and 5-10 fold with the block heater. All IR-heated systems enabled the accurate analysis of a certified reference material (CRM) of waste water. &#xd;
      Third, the effect of IR heating of the top surface of a cyclonic spray chamber on the analytical performance of ICPOES was investigated. Upon IR heating (up to 150 °C), sensitivity and detection limit improved  by 3-5 fold and 4-12 fold, respectively compared to those with the same system at room temperature. The IR-heated system allowed the accurate multi-elemental analysis of two CRMs.&#xd;
      Finally, addition of H2, N2 or water vapour to the central gas flow of the plasma was assessed to enhance the analytical performance of solid sampling (SS) ETV-ICPOES. Sensitivity and detection limit were significantly improved upon sheathing the sample aerosol with H2, N2 or water vapour for 11 elements compared to those with conventional SS-ETV-ICPOES. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first published study of the effect of adding N2 to the central gas flow of the plasma on the analytical performance of SS-ETV-ICPOES.</description>

   <description>Solvent-borne acrylic resins are commonly used in automotive coatings formulations due to the superior characteristics they provide to the final products. Hydroxyl-functionality, incorporated by selection of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) or 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA) as monomers, is required to ensure that the low molecular weight chains produced by free radical copolymerization participate in the cross-linking reactions to form the final coating product. Hence, the knowledge of their copolymerization kinetic coefficients is vital for both process and recipe improvements.&#xd;
In the first part of this work, the pulsed laser polymerization (PLP) technique is paired with size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to provide kinetic coefficients for the copolymerization of HEMA with butyl methacrylate (BMA) in various solvents. These experiments provide insights into the influence of solvent type on the copolymerization reactivity ratios and composition-averaged propagation rate coefficients.&#xd;
In the second part of the study, small scale semi-batch reactions were conducted to investigate the influence of temperature, monomer composition and initiator content on the copolymerization of HEA with BMA. The effect of HEA content and copolymer molecular weight (MW) on resin performance was investigated by determining the amount and MWs of non-functional polymer that could be extracted after forming crosslinked films from the resins. Characterization of the extractable material by NMR, SEC, and by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) confirmed that the polymer extracted contained negligible levels of HEA. The experimental results were compared to Predici® and Monte Carlo simulations of the system</description>

   <description>This thesis consists of three essays that use dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models to study the interactions between the goods sector and the financial sector of the economy in the presence of search frictions in the asset market.&#xd;
In Chapter 2, I construct a real business cycle model with search frictions in the asset market to endogenize asset liquidity. In the model, asset liquidity depends on the probability of matching a seller with an appropriate buyer. In this way, an exogenous shock in the real sector can cause asset liquidity to fluctuate by changing the tightness of the asset market. In this chapter, I demonstrate the existence of steady states, and examine the properties of the equilibria.&#xd;
In Chapter 3, I used the model discussed in Chapter 2, together with productivity and liquidity  hocks estimated using a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) on U.S. data to investigate how asset liquidity and asset prices fluctuate in response to productivity and liquidity shocks, and how, in turn, these fluctuations magnify the impact of productivity shocks on economic activity. In addition, I compare the business cycle properties generated by the baseline model to models without search frictions in the asset market in order to assess the importance of search frictions. I find that productivity and liquidity shocks are equally important in explaining business cycles. The model also shows that productivity shocks generate pro-cyclical movements of hours worked and asset prices, which is not the case for liquidity shock.&#xd;
In Chapter 4, I compare two models with search frictions in the asset market that differ in terms of their assumptions regarding the supply and the demand sides of the market. Two factors discussed in the paper are adjustment costs and government bonds.  After calibrating the models, I find that the model with both adjustment costs and government bonds generates pro cyclical movements in asset prices. In addition, the inclusions of adjustment costs significantly enlarge the volatility of asset prices because the adjustment costs prevent the asset price from immediately regressing to the steady state.</description>

   <title>Confidence intervals and measures of significant change for KINARM Standard Tests</title>
   <creator>Early, Spencer</creator>

   <subject>KINARM</subject>
   <description>Neurological assessment plays a pivotal role in the overall diagnostic and prognostic process of patient care. The effectiveness of the various examinations and methods of neurological assessment are based on the accuracy and precision of the measure. In other words, a good assessment tool should properly reflect the participant’s abilities in any tested domain, while also providing the same score of those abilities over repeat assessments. Traditional neurological assessment tools are faced with many challenges when attempting to meet this criteria. This is primarily the result of many tools relying on the subjective decisions and rely on coarse rating scales in order for clinician’s in order that clinicians can maintain similar scores. A potential alternative is robotic technologies for neurological assessment. Overall, these robotic tools can provide a more objective and reproducible measure of participant performance, when compared to traditional tools.&#xd;
&#xd;
The purpose of this thesis was to assess participants on the KINARM standard tests with the goal of quantifying performance variability across repeat evaluations. Utilizing the KINARM exoskeleton robot, control participants were assessed twice with the maximum time between evaluations set at 1 week. The tasks are divided into 4 categories, motor tasks, motor-cognitive tasks, cognitive tasks, and one sensory task.&#xd;
&#xd;
The results of this thesis revealed confidence intervals smaller than the population interval in 99% of task parameters. Significant learning effects were more prevalent in cognitive and motor-cognitive tasks when compared to sensory and motor tasks. Confidence intervals for TaskScores, the global performance measure, ranged from 0.74 to 1.68 for all KINARM standard tests. Moreover, significant change cut-off values ranged from 1.03 to 2.36 with 55% of tasks shown to have significant learning effects over repeat assessment. &#xd;
&#xd;
These metrics will improve the interpretation of participant performance with respect to individual parameter scores. They also provide a solid framework for many future KINARM studies, most notably the emerging problem of reducing overall assessment time.</description>

   <title>Assessing long-term environmental trends in Ontario lakes that support Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush)</title>

   <description>Oxygenated habitats for Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush) are projected to deteriorate with climate warming. However, a paucity of long-term limnological monitoring data impedes the ability to determine if concentrations of end-of-summer volume weighted hypolimnetic oxygen (VWHO), a management-relevant metric of deepwater oxygen conditions, have changed and if so, what environmental variables are driving these changes. This research uses limnological and paleolimnological records to investigate long-term trends in VWHO and variables that influence VWHO in Ontario Lake Trout lakes across multiple spatial and temporal scales. An investigation of ~40 years of biweekly temperature-oxygen profiles collected from six lakes in south-central Ontario tracked recent (post-2010) increases in end-of-summer VWHO and in the amount of optimal Lake Trout habitat. These changes were driven by increases in both hypolimnetic volume and hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations. Using paleolimnology, the temporal scope of this thesis was extended to analyze environmental conditions in three Lake Trout lakes over the past 100–150 years. These data suggested primary production has increased independent of lake nutrient concentrations – a significant finding as current management strategies primarily rely on limiting phosphorus loading to prevent hypolimnetic oxygen depletion. To expand the spatial scope, sediment cores from four additional study lakes (seven lakes in total) were investigated. This included an analysis of sedimentary records from two basins within the same lake, which demonstrated the individual sensitivities of unique basins to localized stressors. Paleolimnological inferences from all seven study lakes indicated that most lakes have increased with respect to thermal stability, lakewater total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations, and whole-lake primary production over the past century. Meanwhile, only two of the study lakes appear to have undergone nutrient enrichment. These findings are significant as they emphasize the need to incorporate the combined influence of warming and rising TOC concentrations (in addition to limiting nutrient loading) into management strategies for coldwater fish habitat. Collectively, this research provides insight on temporal and spatial trends of environmental variables that can impact oxygenated habitat for Lake Trout. The observed VWHO increases (in both limnological and paleolimnological data) emphasize the complex influence of multiple environmental drivers on coldwater fish habitat.</description>

   <description>This dissertation is a study of Robert Lowth’s theorizing of the Hebraic sublime and its posterity in the second half of the eighteenth century. I begin with an exploration of Lowth’s description of the sublime across Lectures XIV-XVII, showing how, counter to his own claims about copying Longinus, the principle that underlies his sublime rhetoric— figurative dissimilarity—is the opposite of the principle that Longinus repeats several times in the Peri Hypsous. Whereas Longinus argues that figures and tropes should be used inconspicuously, Lowth argues from the Hebrew Scriptures that the conspicuity of the rhetorical construction is key to the excitation of the passions that follows the sublime encounter. Seeking to contextualize Lowth’s theorizing within intersecting critical, social and literary discourses, I investigate Lowth’s differing opinions of the concept of enthusiasm. Though he preached against it as a bishop in 1767, his earlier, positive images of enthusiasm in the Lectures reflect the influence of John Dennis’s Grounds of Criticism. Having contextualized Lowth’s theorizing, I turn to explore his influence on Christopher Smart and William Blake. Both poets, bearing a strong individual poetic vision, find in Lowth’s Lectures a sublime rhetorical toolkit as well as a model of prophetic authority. Their relation to Lowth can be traced on a trajectory: while Smart shares Lowth’s commitment to the church as an institution without his conservative theology, Blake uses biblical language and imagery but rejects both orthodoxy and the church as an organization. This trajectory ends with Percy Bysshe Shelley, who affirms the prophetic authority enabled by Lowth’s Hebraic sublime, but without the rhetoric he described nor the Christianity that motivated his study.</description>

   <description>Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have gained a tremendous amount of interest, due to their applications in display and solid-state lighting technologies. This interest mainly arises from the easy and inexpensive manufacturing processes for the fabrication of lightweight, transparent, flexible, and large-area devices. While OLEDs have now reached the stage of commercialization, there are still some serious issues associated with exciton-exciton and exciton-polaron annihilation mechanisms, which reduce their efficiency particularly under the high current densities required to achieve a high level of brightness. This phenomenon is known as efficiency roll-off. On the other hand, since most luminescent organic semiconductors are in principle four-level lasing systems, color-tunable and easy-to-manufacture optically pumped organic solid-sate lasers (OSLs) have attracted a lot of attention, due to their applications in biological sensing, spectroscopy, and data communication. However, highly demanded portable electrically driven continuous-wave (CW) OSLs (organic diode lasers) have not been realized to date. This is mainly because of the above-mentioned efficiency roll-off issue under the high current densities required to achieve lasing threshold in OLEDs.&#xd;
Visible-emitting trivalent lanthanide ions (Ln3+) are promising emitters for OLED applications. They are also known for their excellent lasing properties, owing to their long excited-state lifetimes, favoring population inversion in optically pumped plastic lasers and amplifiers. Furthermore, near infrared (NIR)-emitting trivalent lanthanide ions are important emitters in telecommunication applications in the 900-1600 nm spectral range. Despite the fact that lanthanide-based emitters have been studied in the NIR-emitting OLEDs, their efficiency is still much lower than in their visible-emitting counterparts. Moreover, like other types of OLED, lanthanide-based devices suffer from the aforementioned efficiency roll-off mechanisms. In the present thesis, we show enhanced efficiency from solution-processed NIR-emitting lanthanide-based OLEDs. We also demonstrate unprecedented low efficiency roll-off characteristics in both visible and NIR-emitting lanthanide-based devices.</description>

   <description>This thesis examines several topics relating to family background and educational achievement. Chapter 2 examines the influence of credit constraints and government policy on college choice and educational attainment in the United States. We propose a discrete dynamic programming model of human capital accumulation where agents make schooling, borrowing, saving, and work decisions. Structural parameters of the model are estimated using from the 1997 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97) and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). The fitted model underpredicts on a number of key dimensions, but provides a preliminary framework to explore counterfactual policies. These policy experiments indicate that college choice and completion are not influenced by changes to tuition levels, interest rates or grants. We find that the non-pecuniary benefits of attending private schools plays an important role in individual college choice. &#xd;
&#xd;
Chapters 3 and 4 analyze the test gap between ethnic minorities and white students in Canada with a focus on the Indigenous-white test score gap. In Chapter 3, we use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth to show that after controlling for a rich set of observables, students who self-identify as Indigenous perform 0.31 standard deviations lower on a standardized math test compared to their white counterparts. Counterfactual distributions from the decomposition method of Lemiuex (2002) suggest that the test gap between low performing students is more than eliminated after accounting for the differences in the returns to and levels of observable characteristics; however, a sizeable gap remains among high performing students. Chapter 4 further explores the timing of the emergence of the test gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous youth. We find that the test score gap emerges at 12 years of age, and, despite renewed attention to Indigenous education, the test score gap has not improved between 1994 and 2009.</description>

   <description>Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzers are ideally suited to pairing with renewable energy sources given the capability to operate at high current densities and transition between different potential loading.  To become commercially competitive however PEM electrolyzers require improvements in performance and cost reduction.  Much of the technology for PEM electrolysis has comes from PEM fuel cells, leaving room for improvement.  The slower reaction kinetics and highly corrosive environment at the anode due to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in particular requires research and development to increase efficiency.  This study focuses on the behavior of two-phase flow of oxygen in water as it relates to cell performance.  Optical visualization with a high speed camera was used to observe oxygen bubbles at the anode during PEM electrolysis.&#xd;
&#xd;
Images of oxygen bubbles in two-phase flow were successfully recorded using three experimental setups: a sample holder submerged in a water filled tank, a modified channel-less PEM electrolyzer cell and a modified PEM electrolyzer cell with optically accessible channels.  Image processing pathways were successfully developed using MATLAB and Fiji to study individual bubbles in all setups.  The channel-less electrolyzer setup operated at a much lower performance than standard PEM electrolyzer cells.  It is suspected that contact resistance reduces the electrochemical performance either as a result of the in-plane conductivity for the PTL being very high or large ohmic contact losses where the PTL contacts the current distributor.  The optically accessible channel design was able to operate at performances comparable to an unmodified cell and bubble images were captured in-situ to observe bubbly to annular flow regimes over a range of current densities.  This investigation showed that flow field channel aspect ratio is an important determinant to cell performance.</description>

   <title>Electrochemical Water Oxidation by Heterogenized Iridium-NHC Precatalyst</title>

   <subject>Heterogenized Water Oxidation</subject>
   <description>Hydrogen production from water splitting provides a potential source for clean energy storage. However, this process requires catalysts that can oxidize water to provide a source of electrons for proton reduction. Various molecular catalysts have been investigated based on their high activity and tunability, but their solubility and limited stability restrict their use in practical applications. Here, we reported a heterogenized iridium-NHC catalyst that can drive water oxidation reaction by electricity directly. The catalyst was prepared by two steps: first the NHC was immobilized on a gold surface, followed by reacting with [IrCp*Cl2]2. This strategy provides a convenient way to systematically evaluate catalysts under optimized conditions, potentially leading to new insights into electrochemical water oxidation processes and water oxidation catalyst design.</description>

   <description>The global economy must make a radical shift to lower carbon emissions to avert large-scale impacts from climate change. Fuels derived from widely available biomass such as macroalgae, have the potential to limit the CO2 impact of transportation by reducing the reliance on fossil fuels. 5-(Hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF) is a jet fuel precursor that can be produced from carbohydrates such as those available in macroalgal biomass. However, researchers pursuing the production of HMF from inexpensive carbohydrates have struggled to achieve high yields under economically sustainable conditions due to low yields and the formation of side-products such as organic acids and humic oligomers. Current methods for HMF preparation typically utilize reagents, reaction conditions and purification protocols that are not suitable for commercial biofuel production. In 2010, high-pressure CO2 was identified as a potential catalyst for HMF production. This thesis describes work done to improve the understanding of CO2-catalyzed HMF production. An initial study examined the effect of temperature, pressure and salt selection on CO2-catalyzed HMF production from glucose. It was found that an initial concentration of 1% glucose (in pentanol containing 10 mL of 10% CaCl2 solution) reacted at 200 oC under a pressure of 7 MPa of CO2 could produce HMF in a 64% yield. These same conditions were then applied to starch, xylan, and cellulose, and yields of 55%, 51%, and 22%, respectively, were obtained. Efforts were then made to improve HMF yield from cellulose by improving the reaction conditions and it was found that application of a temperature of 200 oC over 4 hours of reaction time gave the best yields (43% total furans), although the relationship between CO2 pressure and HMF production appears to be weaker than initially anticipated. Exploratory work was also done assessing the use of novel 5-HMF production methods, such as recycle-experiments and simultaneous production of the acetone adduct. Overall, this thesis work offers evidence that CO2-catalyzed production of 5-HMF and furfural from cellulose is possible, and assists in determining the best conditions for preforming this conversion.</description>

   <description>The mental abilities required to identify, understand, and respond to social information are broadly referred to as social cognition, and individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders display significant impairments in these abilities. Social cognition has been identified as a primary contributor to functional outcomes in psychosis, and represents a critical target for treatment and recovery. Although previous research has extensively examined the magnitude of social cognitive impairments across phases of psychosis using a variety of measures, the factors that contribute to social cognition are still relatively unknown, but may hold the key to improve our understanding of why these impairments arise and persist over time. Because traditional measures of social cognition place demands on neurocognitive and motivational resources, it was hypothesized these illness-related factors would be implicated in the social cognitive performance of individuals in the early stages of a psychotic disorder. In two studies, tasks of social cognition were experimentally manipulated to assess for the influence of cognitive biases and amotivation on performance in a sample of early psychosis patients (n = 35) and demographically-matched community controls (n = 35). Results from these studies demonstrated that jumping to conclusions, a cognitive bias common to psychosis, and extrinsic motivators during testing were directly associated with outcomes on tasks of social cognition, and that these factors were particularly relevant to the performance of the early psychosis group. These studies add to the existing literature on social cognition in psychosis by emphasizing the role of jumping to conclusions and amotivation, which may be informative for refining the theoretical model of social cognition and enhancing interventions designed to remediate these impairments. Moreover, the functional relevance of social cognition highlights the importance of ongoing research efforts using experimental designs to better understand the illness-related factors most strongly associated with social cognition in psychosis.</description>

   <description>The seven studies within this dissertation investigate the nature of transformational leadership. I consider whether transformational leadership is affective, whether it is multidimensional, and whether people perceive differences in the magnitude of transformational leadership. The first study tests the idea that the dimensions of transformational leadership have unique emotional valences. Studies 2, 3, 4, and 5 propose that followers’ ability to recognize emotion will affect their perceptions of transformational leadership; and examines whether individuals higher in emotion recognition are better able to identify and differentiate between the dimensions of transformational leadership. In Study 6, I manipulate the magnitude of transformational leadership to assess whether followers are able to perceive differences between small, medium, and large displays of transformational leadership. This study also tests whether follower emotion recognition and positive mood influence the identification of magnitude. Finally, Study 7 uses confirmatory factor analysis to test the validity of the multidimensionality of transformational leadership by examining its factor structure with followers’ emotion recognition and liking of their leader included in the model.</description>

   <subject>Métis cultural rediscovery</subject>
   <description>Abstract&#xd;
This paper begins with an Indigenous buffalo teaching. It is followed by aspects of my own story of Métis cultural rediscovery. My hope is this will provide insight into why I am undertaking this writing, as well as provide a means to share information. The hypothesis of this thesis indicates that there exists a gap in knowledge and approach in education which can lead to reduced participation and success from Métis learners. A core premise indicates reclaiming a healthy and prideful identity is beneficial for learning success for Métis, both in formal educational settings, as well as informal and lifelong learning endeavors. This thesis was designed to provide some understanding of the meaningfulness of reclaiming a Métis identity.&#xd;
The questions informing this study are: How does story provide insight on Métis learning? Considering Métis history, what are ways to strengthen Métis positive identity in formal education settings? &#xd;
What emerges from the author’s story that may broaden understanding of Métis learning and transformative mindset?&#xd;
Several themes were identified and discussed related to these questions. This thesis is organized around several chapters, each containing stories that weave in and out of the points I want to make about Métis identity, features lost and reclaimed, and education for Métis people.</description>

   <subject>Repeat Well Testing</subject>
   <description>Purpose: An estimated 4.3 million Canadians use private wells for daily water consumption, however well testing rates are declining, potentially resulting in an increased risk of exposure to groundwater contaminants associated with acute gastrointestinal infections (AGIs). Regular testing of well water is recommended to reduce the risk of consuming contaminated groundwater. &#xd;
Methods: This study used a large dataset composed of well testing and well construction data maintained by the government of Ontario. All tests conducted in southern Ontario between 2012 and 2016 were included. Log-binomial regression was used to investigate the association between SES and well water testing practices, with season and index test status included as covariates. Rurality, based on population density, was assessed as an effect modifier of this relationship.&#xd;
Results: The dataset contained information for 417,406 individual wells, 114,820 (27.51%) of which were tested during the study period, with two thirds (66.72%) of these sampled more than once. In urban (>400 people/km2) and peri-urban regions (>150 and &lt;400 people/km2), wells located in low socioeconomic status (SES) areas were 14% and 15% less likely to be tested compared to high SES areas (RR: 0.86 (0.78, 0.95) and RR: 0.85 (0.76, 0.94), respectively). In rural regions (&lt;150 people/km2), wells located in low SES areas were 13% more likely to be tested compared to high SES areas (RR: 1.13 (1.11, 1.15)). SES was not significantly associated with repeat testing in urban/peri-urban regions and was weakly associated in rural regions (RR = 1.06 (1.04, 1.07)).  Positive index tests were associated with a 17% increased likelihood of repeat testing when compared to negative index tests, while accounting for the effect of season and SES (RR = 1.17 (1.16, 1.18))&#xd;
Conclusion: Rurality and SES are important predictors of the decision to test a well, with index test status the most influential predictor of repeated well testing. Further research is required to assess the influence of SES at an individual level. These findings provide important information for public health agencies in the context of strategic and targeted water testing promotion.</description>

   <title>Investigating Selenium Usage Challenges and Reducing the Performance Overhead of Selenium-based Load Tests</title>

   <subject>Stack Overflow</subject>
   <description>Selenium automates the testing of web applications. Quality Assurance (QA) engineers usually write Selenium scripts to test the content that is rendered in a browser and simulate user interactions with the web content for web applications. Apart from test automation, Selenium is also used to perform load testing and web scraping tasks. Selenium has gained a great amount of attention from users as observed from the trend of Selenium-tagged questions on StackOverflow. In this thesis, we first explore the Selenium-related questions on StackOverflow to understand users' questions about Selenium, programming-language specific issues, browser-specific concerns and the difficult aspects of Selenium. Some of the notable findings from our empirical study are:  Questions about Python have become the most frequent and the fastest growing programming language related questions in Selenium, while questions on Java have become stable in recent years. We also find that Chrome tag is the most frequently used browser tag among other browser related tags associated with Selenium. Several users discuss performance issues in Selenium tests on StackOverflow. Prior work on Selenium also points out that Selenium tests are resource intensive. As Selenium needs to launch a browser for each instance (e.g., a client) of a test, it is usually very resource consuming to run a load test using Selenium as one would need to run thousands of user instances. We propose an approach to reduce the performance overhead of Selenium-based load tests. Our approach shares browser instances between user instances, thereby reducing the performance overhead that is introduced by launching many browser instances. The main contribution of this thesis is that our approach can significantly increase the number of user instances that can be tested on a test driver machine without overloading the machine. We improve the testing efficiency of Selenium-based load tests by at least 20%. The insights that we share in this work can help the developers of Selenium understand how Selenium is used in practice and how they can offer better support for Selenium. Further, software practitioners can benefit from our approach to reduce the performance overhead of Selenium-based load tests.</description>

   <description>RET is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) which is normally activated at the cell surface by glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factors and plays critical roles during embryogenesis. RET is expressed as two protein isoforms, RET9 and RET51, named for the lengths of their isoform-specific tail sequences. RET also acts as an oncogenic driver in several cancers, and its expression has recently been linked to aggressiveness in multiple tumour types. However, the specific contributions of RET to tumourigenesis are not yet well described. Here we demonstrate that expression of constitutively activated RET in thyroid carcinoma cells contributes to growth, survival, motility and invasiveness, and that loss of RET expression coincides with reduced mesenchymal gene expression with gain of epithelial markers. We showed that activation of wildtype RET in pancreatic adenocarcinomas enhanced directional motility and invasion, suggesting that expression of RET may contribute to invasion towards sources of ligand, such as peripheral nerves. We further showed that RET activation induced invadopodia formation, and that RET interacted with TKS5, an adaptor protein critical for invadopodia formation and function. We observed functional differences between RET isoforms, and demonstrated in both thyroid carcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells, that RET51 is more potent than RET9 in enhancing expression of mesenchymal genes, promoting invadopodia formation, cell polarization, cell motility and invasion. Together, our work suggests RET expression, particularly that of RET51, may be useful as a marker for tumour invasiveness in a number of clinically challenging cancers, and that RET may be a potential therapeutic target for treatment of these diseases.</description>

   <title>Investigation of Hydroisomerization Catalysts and Reaction Conditions to produce Branched-Chain Fatty Acids</title>

   <description>Fatty acids (FAs) from vegetable oils can be used as feed to produce renewable hydrocarbons and bio-lubricants. Naturally occurring FAs are, however, susceptible to oxidative attack and have operating temperature limitations due to poor cold flow properties. Converting FAs into saturated branch-chain isomers would alleviate these restrictions. Combining the hydrogenation and skeletal isomerization of C=C double bonds in FAs required to form saturated branch-chain FAs into one single hydroisomerization reactor would significantly reduce the complexity and costs of production of these renewable hydrocarbons. This project thus investigated possibility of hydroisomerization of oleic acid to produce saturated branched-chain FA isomers in a single reactor by developing and testing hydroisomerization catalysts. In this process, acidic solid surfaces promote isomerization reactions, while hydrogenation is catalyzed by active metals. Bifunctional Pt on H+-Beta zeolite catalysts were synthesized through incipient wetness impregnation and tested in a batch reactor. Hydroisomerization was unsuccessful as hydrogenation of double bonds was favoured over the competing skeletal isomerization reaction, resulting in a saturated straight-chain FA. The melting point of products increased from 13 °C to 62 °C. Due to these findings, preliminary exploration of effects on skeletal isomerization of oleic acid to form bc-isomers was instead investigated by omitting platinum. Reactions were conducted in the presence of N2 or H2 gas at varying pressures. Triphenylphosphine was added to some experiments to block the external acid sites of the zeolite, and deionized water was added as a co-catalyst. Four zeolites of interest, 12.5 silica-alumina ratio H+-Beta, 19 silica-alumina ratio H+-beta, SAPO-11 and MCM-41, were also tested. These zeolites represented varying pore sizes and acidity (Silica to Alumina ratio). It was shown that the pore size has a greater effect on catalytic activity than acidity. A maximum bc-isomer yield of 63 wt% was achieved with 5 wt% H+-Beta zeolite in oleic acid under a H2 pressure of 15 bar and reactor set-point of 280 ºC, stirred for 6 h in a batch reactor. Product analysis indicated that trans-isomers and lactones were also produced as by-products of the skeletal isomerization.</description>

   <description>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss in developed countries in those 50 years of age and older. Increased expression of the protein vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a large role in the onset and progression of the advanced, wet form of AMD. To deliver drugs to the posterior chamber of the eye to treat diseases such as AMD, intravitreal injections are performed. Due to the side effects associated with intravitreal injections, such as retinal detachment and hemorrhage, it is advantageous to reduce the frequency of injections required for treatment. This thesis investigates sustaining the release of drug through encapsulation in polymer microspheres coated with polyelectrolyte layers of poly-L-lysine (PLL) and hyaluronic acid (HA) with the potential for protein-triggered release using aptamers.&#xd;
	In this research, the feasibility of crosslinking HA with aptamer-containing DNA oligomers for protein-triggered release (for example, in response to VEGF in AMD) was evaluated and the crosslinking of HA layers by methods of click chemistry and through a carbodiimide reaction were compared. The lysozyme aptamer (used for proof-of-concept) in the DNA crosslinker retained its affinity for lysozyme, although lower binding occurred when incubated in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The lysozyme aptamer showed moderate specificity when incubated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) or chymotrypsin as the aptamer did not bind BSA, however there was slight binding when incubated with chymotrypsin.&#xd;
	The properties of the PLL/HA layers on calcium alginate microspheres affected the in vitro release of encapsulated model drug FITC-dextran (MW 10 kDa) into PBS. Coating microspheres with 3 polyelectrolyte layers consisting of PLL, HA crosslinked with poly(ethylene glycol) diamine at a 1:5 molar ratio of amine groups to HA carboxyl groups, and a final layer of PLL did not change the release profile of FITC-dextran in comparison to release from microspheres coated with un-crosslinked layers. Increasing the number of layers on the microspheres from 3 to 5 layers significantly decreased the amount of encapsulated FITC-dextran released. However, increasing the number of layers to 7 layers did not further sustain the release of FITC-dextran.</description>

   <description>Zirconium alloys are commonly used in nuclear reactor in-core components due to their good mechanical properties and low neutron-absorption cross-section. Especially for CANada Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) reactors, zirconium alloys serve as the main structural material for fuel channels. In order to ensure such Zr components operate safely, fracture analysis of Zr alloys has been widely studied. Considering the high cost and difficulties associated with using neutron-irradiated Zr specimens for fracture analysis, proton irradiated testing has been proposed to reduce the cost and maintain a good control of experimental conditions during irradiation. However, limited by the proton penetration depth, fracture testing on proton-irradiated samples needs to be conducted on thin foils which brings increased plastic deformation due to the low constraint.  This dissertation mainly focuses on conducting fracture testing with Zr foils. Combined with finite element modeling, scanning electron microscopy analysis, and digital image correlation analysis, the fracture behavior at a crack tip from both macroscopic strain analysis and microscopic dislocation motion analysis was achieved. &#xd;
The current study is comprised of three manuscript chapters. The Mode I fracture testing of Zr foils under plane-stress conditions is discussed in Chapter 3. Using conventional fracture testing combined with digital image correlation analysis, the J-integral, J-resistance curves and the singular strain field in front of a crack were all obtained. In Chapter 4, the dislocation evolution at the crack-tip field was analyzed during the crack initiation and propagation stages from a microscopic perspective. Both fracture toughness J-integral analysis and geometrically necessary dislocation determination indicate a single J-integral characterized crack-tip field may exist in Zr foils regardless of the large scale yielding condition. The crack propagation behavior was investigated from a crystallographic view in Chapter 5. Schmid factor analysis were compared with the geometrically necessary dislocation determination and relatively good agreement was observed. It was found that the crack is more likely to propagate along grains with c-axis close to the loading axis. A general discussion is given in Chapter 6, followed by a summary in Chapter 7.</description>

   <title>"It's Just a Sport. It's Just a Sport, Right?": The Reproduction of Class Privilege in Ultimate</title>

   <description>Invented in 1968, Ultimate is a self-officiating, non-contact, team sport played with a flying disc. Over the course of the past 50 years, Ultimate has rapidly gained popularity and is often cited as being among the fastest growing sports in the world (World Flying Disc Federation, 2015; USA Ultimate, 2015). Interestingly, because it requires no referees, is usually played mixed (co-ed), and can be inexpensive to play, proponents of the sport portray Ultimate as being a more accessible and equitable alternative to “mainstream” sports (Walters, 2008). However, despite these distinctive traits and this progressive rhetoric, as a committed member of the Ultimate community for the last decade, I’ve noticed a problem: Ultimate tends to be played only by an incredibly homogenous and privileged group of people. Further, Ultimate has only been studied by a handful of people (Hamish Crocket, Gerald Griggs, Lindsay Pattison, Andrew Thornton, and Kirsten Walters), none of whom have substantively addressed the Ultimate community’s apparent homogeneity and affluence. In this thesis, I address this issue by employing Pierre Bourdieu’s conceptual schema to analyse my five-month long ethnographic research project as a member of the Ultimate community in Kingston, Ontario. Specifically, I use Bourdieu’s notion of social class and his concepts of capital, habitus, and taste to analyse the seven interviews that I conducted with mixed Ultimate players and the field notes I took during several hundred hours of participant observation.  In doing so, I develop the argument that active participation in the Kingston Ultimate community functions to systematically maintain and reproduce the structural advantages of an already privileged group of people. I suggest, therefore, that Ultimate, a purportedly progressive form of recreation, is, in fact, a mechanism through which players distinguish themselves from “lower class” groups, thus (re)producing a particular social class identity that locates them at the top of the social hierarchy. I conclude this thesis by offering my recommendations for how individual Ultimate players and the entire Ultimate community might improve the accessibility and equity of our sport.</description>

   <title>Polymeric Ionic Liquid Compositions for In-Situ Product Removal Bioreactor Applications</title>

   <description>Although the biosynthesis of n-butanol and succinic acid can afford renewable fuels, solvents, and chemical intermediates, these bioprocesses suffer from the cytotoxicity of their end products, leading to reduced production rates. In-situ product removal using a two-phase partitioning bioreactor (TPPB) can alleviate this problem by sequestering reaction products in a secondary, non-aqueous phase. Effective sorbents for TPPB applications are biocompatible materials with a high thermodynamic affinity for the product, as quantified by partition coefficient (PC), and a preference for solute over water, as measured by selectivity (α).&#xd;
In this work, the absorptive capacity of imidazolium-based ionic liquids (ILs) are combined with the attractive physical properties of polymeric sorbents by synthesizing a range of polymeric ionic liquid (PIL) compositions. Careful measurements of PIL molecular weight, glass transition temperature (Tg) and crystallinity were followed by systematic studies of the effect of imidazolium cation substituents and counter-anions on PC and α for the n-butanol-water system. P[(VC12-linIm)(Br)] was identified as the most promising PIL n-butanol absorbent by virtue of a PCBuOH = 7.4 ± 0.3, and αb/w = 97 ± 7. An expanded study of the ternary PIL/water/n-butanol phase diagram was integrated with material balance equations for a solute recovery process to gain insight into the impact of polymer phase fraction, PC, α, feed concentration, and Tg on the recovery of n-butanol from dilute fermentation media.&#xd;
The final phase of the project exploited experience gained on the preparation and phase behavior of P[(VC12-linIm)(Br)] to prepare a hydroxide-functionalized PIL. The utility of this base-functionalized material to chemisorb succinic acid from dilute aqueous solution was demonstrated along with its resilience toward repeated regeneration and reuse.</description>

   <title>Neural Processing in Primary Motor Cortex and its Relationship to Contralateral and Ipsilateral Motor Actions</title>

   <description>The role of primary motor cortex (M1) in controlling movements has been a long-debated subject because M1 neurons have been shown to relate to many different aspects of motor control. A confounding issue is that different features of movement are inter-correlated so M1 activity related to one aspect of movement will correlate with other aspects of movement. In our first experiment, we circumvented this problem by recording from M1 neurons in monkeys across two different tasks with different kinematics and kinetics. In the first task, we applied forces to the arms in a postural task, and classified neurons into muscle-like groups based on their force preference. In the second task, the monkey reached to spatial targets and we found that the activity of each group of M1 neurons predicted the reaching directional preferences and activity patterns of their associated muscles. This suggests that M1 contributes to producing these patterns of muscle activity. The last projects explored how M1 activity can reflect information unrelated to motor patterns for the contralateral limb, such as motor patterns of the ipsilateral limb. Why does this ipsilateral-related activity not lead to contralateral limb motion? In our second experiment, we recorded from M1 neurons while we applied forces to each arm separately. We found that the torque preferences of M1 neurons were commonly different for ipsilateral and contralateral torque. The result is that M1 activity when generating ipsilateral shoulder flexor activity, would not lead to any increase in activity of any muscle group in the contralateral limb. In our third experiment, we recorded from M1 neurons while applying contralateral and ipsilateral forces at the same time. The resultant activity in M1 could be predicted by the response of the neuron during contralateral or ipsilateral torques alone, albeit scaled down in magnitude particularly related to the ipsilateral limb. The results of this thesis show that M1 is capable of producing patterns of muscle activity during voluntary motor tasks of the contralateral limb, but that other information can be simultaneously represented across the neural population.</description>

   <title>Is Daoism Green? Engaging Daoist Responses to Environmental Challenges in China</title>

   <description>This paper seeks to examine the role that Daoism is playing in environmental activism in China. It analyzes a variety of sources including academic literature, primary source material from Daoist groups and my own research from interviews and visits to Daoist sites. The research demonstrates that Daoism’s interaction with ecology in China can be understood in three specific ways. The first interaction is through Daoism’s relationship with physical space; specifically, the quality of the environment of surrounding temple spaces and the relationship that Daoists have to space and place. The second way to think about the interaction of Daoism and ecology is through the global environmental movement that aims to connect religious issues with environmental issues; we see this aspect most prominently in the CDA’s relationship with ARC. Finally, the third way to think about the relationship of Daoism and ecology is through the concept of the body, and Daoism’s unique understanding of the role the body plays in relationship to the natural world. Analysis of Daoism along these three modes of analysis highlights the complex and varied approach to ecology found throughout the Daoist community in China and emphasizes the multifaceted nature of the Daoist tradition while revealing the limitations of evaluating a religious tradition through the lens of the modern ecological standards. This analysis has implications for both environmentalism in China and Daoism as a living tradition.</description>

   <title>Page or Stage: Reading Shakespeare Comics as Performance</title>

   <description>While previous scholarship concerning Shakespeare comics has considered their pedagogical function as teaching tools to make Shakespeare more accessible or their role in preserving Shakespeare’s place within the popular culture, this dissertation argues that there is much to be gained by looking at Shakespeare comics through the lens of performance studies. This dissertation considers Shakespeare comics as “players in ongoing relationships” and examines the behavior of the adaptors, illustrators, and readers of Shakespeare comics as analogous to that of actors and audience members. In doing so, it illustrates the various ways in which Shakespeare comics engage both creatively and critically with the playwright’s work. It presents the Manga Shakespeare Romeo and Juliet as an example of a Shakespeare comic which offers an extensive character study that challenges its audience to question conventional readings of the playwright’s protagonists. It then considers the Manga Shakespeare Twelfth Night as an example of a Shakespeare comic which incorporates the reader into the narrative in a way that uses the play as an entry point into a broader commentary upon the social structure which the reader inhabits. And finally, it presents the issue of Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman series entitled A Midsummer Night’s Dream and the Kill Shakespeare series by Antony Del Col and Conor McCreery as examples of Shakespeare comics which speak to the place of the playwright and his dramatic works within the modern world and use the comic form to comment upon the exercise of adapting these works into new media. Through an examination of these works, this dissertation situates Shakespeare comics within four distinct but related traditions: the literary tradition to which Shakespeare belongs, the tradition of adaptation of Shakespeare’s dramatic works, the comics tradition, and the performance tradition.</description>

   <description>Proximity identification has been widely used in access control systems. These systems, in particular Passive Keyless Entry and Start systems (PKES) for high-end automobiles, allow drivers to unlock their vehicles by standing within one meter of the vehicle while carrying a legitimate key fob in their pockets. The PKES systems re¬quire zero interaction from a user since the vehicle is able to detect the presence of the key fob and verify its proximity, thereby allowing the user to have further access to the vehicle. However, due to the restricted processing capacity of the key fobs and the vulnerabilities of RFID technology, these systems may be prone to relay attacks. Some security videos show that thieves executed relay attacks to steal a luxury car in less than one minute. Previous literature findings also demonstrate that conventional PKES systems are vulnerable to attacks that exploit cryptographic techniques such as rolling code scheme and challenge-response scheme. &#xd;
&#xd;
&#xd;
In this thesis, we propose a Context-based Secure Keyless Entry System (CSKES) that adopts Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth 4.0) wireless communication technology and utilizes a wide range of contextual information including round-trip time, RSSI (Receiving Signal Strength Indicator), GPS (Global Positioning System) coordinates, and Jaccard similarity of WiFi APs (Access Points) in order to precisely identify the close proximity of a car to its corresponding key. This multi-feature proximity identification system is highly efficient to mitigate classic relay attacks. We first evaluate each security feature individually to demonstrate their reliability, stability, and rigidity in identifying the characteristics of the environment. Then we implement the proposed system in two parts: an app on iPhone and a simulation application on the laptop. We evaluate the system performance based on three classification models with a dataset collected from normal and abnormal use cases. The results show that the proposed Context-based Secure Keyless Entry System demonstrates great efficiency in identifying physical proximity and preventing classic relay attacks.</description>

   <description>Zirconium alloys are used broadly throughout the nuclear industry due to a combination of its mechanical properties, low neutron absorption cross section, and resistance to corrosion. Understanding the process of plastic deformation in these alloys is important both for predicting in-service behaviour in operating and accident conditions, as well as for optimizing the manufacturing of components.  This thesis presents a body of work based around using advanced materials characterization techniques to study the deformation properties of Zircaloy-2, and how those properties are dependent on the rate of deformation and the history of previously imparted deformation.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis is presented in a manuscript format, composed of four manuscript chapters.  Chapter 3 presents a series of experiments using x-ray diffraction to investigate the effect of changes in the direction of applied strain on the deformation mechanisms and mechanical properties of Zircaloy-2.    Chapter 4 introduces a technique for extending the analysis of conventional stress relaxation experiments to incorporate in situ x-ray diffraction data.  The technique is applied to Zircaloy-2 to demonstrate a dependence of the strain rate sensitivity and activation volume on crystallographic orientation.  Chapter 5 presents a newly developed Matlab computer code for calculating geometrically necessary dislocation density from electron backscattering diffraction data.  The code is applied to measurements performed on the samples from Chapter 3, and validated against an established state of the art technique for measuring dislocation density via x-ray diffraction.  Chapter 6 applies a polycrystalline plasticity model to the experimental data from Chapter 3 to quantify the dislocation density of the material and the work hardening parameters of the individual deformation mechanisms (the former of which is compared with experimental measurements performed in Chapter 5). Following the manuscript chapters, is Chapter 7, which summarizes the main conclusions of the manuscript chapters, discusses how they relate to one another, and provides suggestions for future work.</description>

   <description>The misregulation of epigenetic mechanisms has been linked to disease. Current drugs that treat these dysfunctions have had some success, however many have variable potency, instability in vivo and lack target specificity. This may be due to the limited knowledge of epigenetic mechanisms, especially at the molecular level, and their association with gene expression and its link to disease. Computational approaches, specifically in molecular modeling, have begun to address these issues by complementing phases of drug discovery and development, however, more research is needed on the relationship between genetic mutation and epigenetics and their roles in disease. Gene regulatory network models have been used to better understand diseases, however inferring these networks poses several challenges. To address some of these issues, a multi-label classification technique to infer regulatory networks (MInR), supplemented by semi-supervised, learning is presented. MInR's performance was found to be comparable to other methods that infer regulatory networks when evaluated on a benchmark E. coli dataset. In order to better understand the association of epigenetics with gene expression and its link with disease, MInR was used to infer a regulatory network from a Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC) dataset and was supplemented with gene expression and methylation analysis. Gene expression and methylation analysis revealed a correlation between 5 differentially methylated CpGs and their matched differentially expressed transcripts. Incorporating this information into a network allowed for the visualization of potential systems that may be involved in KIRC. Future analysis of these systems alongside the drug discovery and development process may lead to the discovery of novel therapeutics.</description>

   <description>Degradation of physical and mechanical properties of geomembrane (GMB) base liners in various geoenvironmental applications is investigated. This involved conducting immersion tests to simulate the ageing of GMBs on exposure to chemical solutions simulating field applications. The reduction in stress crack-resistance (SCR) due to physical ageing is examined. It is shown that a reduction in SCR was observed for a 1.5 mm smooth high density polyethylene (HDPE) GMB incubated in municipal solid waste (MSW) leachate and deionized water shortly after immersion to a value designated as SCRm and then stabilized until the end of the ~10-year study. The same GMB is incubated in air, high pH pregnant leach solution, and brine, and a similar reduction is observed in SCR to SCRm estimated by 50% of the initial SCR (SCRo). This early-time reduction in SCR is observed for other ten smooth HDPE GMBs and the mean magnitude of SCRm/SCRo is 0.37. A new definition for time to nominal failure (tNF) is introduced and assessed based on the time at which SCR=0.5·SCRm.This study investigates also the effect of texturing on the longevity of a GMB when immersed in a MSW leachate over a period ~3 years. The comparison of the textured/smooth portions of the HDPE GMB shows that texturing accelerated the OIT depletion by 40% (Std-OIT), but it does not affect the tNF assessed based on SCR. Finally, this study investigates the performance of 13 smooth GMBs when immersed in chlorinated water with concentration simulant to that in potable water reservoirs. A new degradation trend for GMBs stabilized with hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS) and immersed in chlorinated water is introduced. In this new trend, the degradation occurs in two stages. In the first stage, degradation of mechanical properties occurs before the depletion of antioxidants, then the mechanical properties stabilize for a lag time followed by a second stage of degradation until brittleness is reached. The comparison between the longevity of the 13 GMBs shows that the resin type and HALS contribute to a better resistance to degradation.</description>

   <description>BACKGROUND: Prevalence of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been shown to be high in correctional facilities. Testing for HCV begins with a blood test for antibodies followed by an HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) test to establish active infection. Receiving the RNA test is a required step in the cascade of care for HCV management.&#xd;
PURPOSE: This thesis had two main objectives. The first was to determine an association between the facility of first testing positive for HCV antibodies and the time to receiving the RNA test. The facilities of interest were community medical facilities, provincial correctional institutions, and federal correctional institutions. The second objective sought to describe the number of duplicate antibody tests performed at Public Health Ontario Laboratories (PHOL). Once an individual tests positive for HCV antibodies, subsequent antibody tests are considered redundant. &#xd;
METHODS: Both objectives used a subset of PHOL data that included all HCV tests performed at PHOL from 1999-2014. A Cox’s proportional hazards model was used to determine an association between the facility of first antibody test and time to receiving the RNA test while controlling for other variables. The second objective counted the number of antibody tests performed at PHOL after an individual had demonstrated HCV positivity.&#xd;
RESULTS: Individuals who first tested HCV-positive in a provincial facility took longer to receive an RNA test when compared to those first tested in the community or federal prison; females were longer to receive the test when compared to males (hazard ratio [HR]=0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.37, 0.49 provincial vs. community for females in 2009-2014; HR=0.56; 95%CI=0.51, 0.62 provincial vs. community for males in 2009-2014).</description>

   <title>Multi-Material and Multi-Joint Topology Optimization of 3D Structures</title>

   <description>In recent years, topology optimization has become a popular tool in automotive, aerospace and defense industries to generate novel clean slate designs. The most modern of these tools is multi-material topology optimization which is capable of simultaneously distributing material and selecting the optimum material within a design domain. However, a shortcoming of this method is that it cannot consider the practical joining of the inherently multi-component solutions. Since optimal joint design is dependent on optimal component design (and vice versa), it is argued that these aspects must be considered together to generate truly optimum multi-material designs. This limitation is addressed through multi- material and multi-joint topology optimization (MM/MJ  TO) which can generate optimal joint distribution and selection at the boundary of dissimilar materials. Two different gradient-based topology optimization methods will be presented which allow for 3D MM/MJ TO structural design. These are included in the form of two manuscripts. &#xd;
The first manuscript expands on the current state-of- the-art MM/MJ TO algorithm and investigates its efficacy in solving 3D problems. A new concept of tooling accessibility constraints will be introduced that has yet to be discussed in literature. This constraint limits the existence of welded joints in tooling inaccessible regions to ensure manufacturability. The capabilities of the algorithm were demonstrated with three academic complexity 3D numerical examples. Through this work, it was found that the algorithm required prohibitively large computational cost while producing sub-optimal solutions. While this method was the first to achieve MM/MJ TO, it was found to have limited scalability to complex industry-driven design problems. &#xd;
The second manuscript introduces a novel interpolation scheme for performing coupled MM/MJ TO which addresses previous limitations. By removing the need to decouple MM and MJ TO, the algorithm can solve a new set of physically meaningful problem statements while also reducing computational time. Unlike the previous method, the new interpolation scheme enables the material interface to morph, thus capturing the mutual dependency of component and joint design. Through four numerical examples, these capabilities are demonstrated on both academic and high complexity 3D problems.</description>

   <description>Species diversity and identity play an important role in determining community structure and regulating ecosystem processes. However, species interactions are often characterized by the mean effect or response, often ignoring intraspecific variation in trait expression. In this thesis, I examined the ecological consequences of intraspecific trait variation in Daphnia vertical position in plankton communities invaded by the presence of the invasive zooplankton predator, Spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus). In the first chapter, I assessed the factors influencing Daphnia vertical position response to Bythotrephes presence using a field survey of invaded and uninvaded lakes across a gradient of abiotic variables in south-central Ontario. In the second chapter, I examined the influence of Daphnia vertical position on Bythotrephes impacts on plankton communities using mesocosm experiments where I manipulated Bythotrephes presence and Daphnia vertical position. In the final chapter, I used mesocosm experiments to determine if differences in the vertical position of dispersing Daphnia influenced recovery in Daphnia populations invaded by Bythotrephes. Results from my field survey show that Daphnia vertical position response to Bythotrephes is species specific, with only D. mendotae and D. longiremis vertical position influenced by Bythotrephes presence. In invaded lakes, D. mendotae vertical position in dependent on water clarity and Bythotrephes density. Results from my mesocosms experiment suggest that Daphnia vertical position influences the type and magnitude of Bythotrephes impacts on Daphnia populations, resulting in indirect impacts on small cladocerans, large cladocerans and copepodids. Furthermore, differences in Daphnia vertical position in invaded mesocosms influenced algal densities, resulting in trophic cascades in mesocosms where more Daphnia were hypolimnetic. There was no effect of differences in vertical position of dispersing Daphnia on Daphnia populations invaded by Bythotrephes. Taken together, these results suggest that Daphnia vertical position response to Bythotrephes is species specific and that differences in Daphnia vertical position result in differences in Bythotrephes impacts on plankton communities in invaded lakes.</description>

   <description>The dissertation explores the Joint Protocol for Student Achievement (JPSA) through a series of four interrelated papers.  First, education data of 4,109 students were analyzed to understand the educational experiences of students living in out-of-home care (OHC) throughout Ontario during the year (2015–2016) the JPSA was released.  Analyses revealed that students in OHC had higher short-term absentee rates, suspension and expulsion rates, special education placement, and rates of school transfers compared to their peers in the general population.&#xd;
&#xd;
Second, a scoping review of scholarly and gray literature (N=69) was conducted to uncover the common components that support partnership working between youth-serving organizations.  The scoping review identified four key themes (strategic planning, institutional structures, client-level supports, and implementation and evaluation) that were further disaggregated into 16 common components which may support partnerships.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Third, a jurisdictional scan was completed to identify and compare partnership working agreements between education and child welfare sectors located across Canada using the common components of partnerships uncovered during the scoping review.  Including Ontario, five partnership protocols were uncovered. On average, protocols scored highly on factors related to strategic planning (80%), institutional structures (85%), and client-level supports (90%).  However, protocols fell short on factors relating to implementation and evaluation (50%).  &#xd;
&#xd;
Finally, interviews (N=21) were performed with education and child welfare partners in order to understand the perspectives and experiences of developing and implementing the JPSA.  Analysis of the qualitative data gathered from the interviews with education and child welfare stakeholders suggest that provincial working group played a critical role in designing the JPSA provincial template.  At the local level, participants found that designing regional JPSA’s helped to develop new relationships between sectors or formalize already occurring partnership practices.  Issues related to information sharing, implementation, and evaluation were also uncovered.  &#xd;
&#xd;
Recommendations for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers cover five key themes: (a) creation of new JPSA sections, (b) provision of implementation support, (c) development of information and data sharing structures, (b) development of capacity surrounding trauma-informed practice, (c) creation of common evaluation and performance measurement system.</description>

   <description>In this thesis I present three papers on "Implications of Firms' Interactions with Debt Markets".  Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the thesis.  Chapter 2 presents the paper "Does a Firm's Bond IPO have Implications for the Degree of Monitoring by Private Lenders?".  This paper looks at whether private lenders change their degree of monitoring of loans granted to a firm after the firm goes through a bond IPO.  I find that the degree of monitoring on private loans increases after a firm issues public debt for the first time.  Chapter 3 presents the paper "Is Cost of Equity a Function of Leverage?  The Case of Bond IPOs", a co-authored paper with Paul Dion.  In this paper, we investigate whether the changes that a bond IPO brings to the environment of the firm impact the riskiness of the equity of the firm.   We find that the changes in the information, monitoring and agency environment brought about by a bond IPO indeed influence the direction and magnitude of the change of its cost of equity.  Chapter 4 presents "Do Credit Default Swaps Impact Lenders' Monitoring on Loans?".  In this paper, I build on my examination of monitoring of loans by investigating whether lenders change the comprehensiveness and intensity of loan covenants after the firm's Credit Default Swap (CDS) starts trading.  The results provide solid evidence that lenders decrease their degree of monitoring on loans after the inception of a firm's CDS.  Chapter 5 concludes the thesis, summarizing the results of the core papers.</description>

   <description>Entry-to-practice competence frameworks and competency-based approaches to professional education are becoming increasingly popular in Canada and on a global scale. Although competency-based medical education has the potential to inform approaches to the development and assessment of competence across professional disciplines, there are contextual factors which make medical education unique. To date, few studies have compared how university-based professional education programs are using competence frameworks to guide teaching/learning and assessment in their own professional contexts. Consequently, the purpose of this qualitative case study was to explore how professional education programs at a mid-sized Canadian university are conceptualizing and operationalizing entry-to-practice competence frameworks. &#xd;
&#xd;
In Study 1, theoretical tensions between behavioural and integrated conceptions of competence were explored by comparing similarities/differences across ten professions’ entry-to-practice competence frameworks. In Study 2, an in-depth interpretive case study approach was used to explore how the assessment of competence is being operationalized in a highly resourced and work-integrated professional education program. Finally, in Study 3, an embedded case study was used to explore how nine different professional programs, with potentially fewer-resources and work-integrated learning opportunities, are approaching and perhaps problematizing the development and assessment of competence. &#xd;
&#xd;
Taken altogether, the findings of Studies 1, 2, and 3 suggest that how competence is conceptualized and represented matters and has the potential to shape how competence is developed and assessed at the program level. While limited in scope given the use of a single university, the findings highlight: (1) diversity in the approaches to operationalization being used across programs; (2) common attributes which can be used to classify the manner in which these programs operationalize the development and assessment competence; and (3) challenges with supporting academic faculty, who have academic freedom, to buy in to competence as a construct informing pedagogy and assessment. These findings can be used to inform policy and practice decisions about: (1) the role professional programs play in determining competence for entry-to-practice along professional pathways to licensure, and (2) programs’ intents for and approaches to operationalizing entry-to-practice competence frameworks in practice.</description>

   <description>Previous studies by Dr. Nicol showed the first direct in vivo evidence that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ normally suppresses environmental chemical 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-mediated breast tumour progression. Our lab also used mice with targeted knockout (KO) of PPARγ in mammary secretory epithelial (MSE) cells (PPARγMSE-KO mice) and their wildtype (PPARγWT) controls to show DMBA-treated PPARγMSE-KOs had significantly worse breast tumourigenic outcomes versus PPARγWTs; whereas, co-treatment with the PPARγ activating, antidiabetic drug rosiglitazone (ROSI) significantly improves tumourigenic outcomes in PPARγWT but not PPARγMSE-KO mice. I hypothesized activation of MSE-specific PPARγ signaling alters microRNA (miR) expressions to protect against breast tumour metastasis. My aims were to: 1) use enhanced PPARγMSE-KO mice strains to evaluate MSE-specific PPARγ-dependent miR changes in mammary tumours and correlate findings with metastatic events in vivo; and 2) identify PPARγ-dependent miRs that correlate with human breast cancer cell metastatic potential in vitro. To address aim one, PPARγMSE-KO or PPARγMSE-WT mice were crossed onto an enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) reporter mouse background to generate PPARγMSE-KO;EYFP+ and control PPARγMSE-WT;EYFP+ strains respectively, allowing for easy detection of MSE cells for miR profiling. PPARγMSE-WT;EYFP+ mice were treated with DMBA Only or DMBA+ROSI as previously described, and no significant difference was observed in overall survival (OS). Mammary tumours were collected from each treated group for evaluation of miR expressions. To address aim two, the human metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line was transduced to stably express PPARγ and generate both parental (MDA-MB-231parental) and PPARγ expressing (MDA-MB-231PPARγWT) cell lines. Metastatic potential was significantly decreased in MDA-MB-231PPARγWT versus MDA-MB-231parental cells, and following ROSI treatment. qRT-PCR expression changes of five miR targets implicated in tumourigenesis were selected for assessment, and revealed no significant differential expression between the treatment groups in either cell line for any of the miRs. Future studies assessing global expression changes will be critical to determine whether activation of PPARγ alters miR profiles to prevent breast cancer metastasis.</description>

   <description>The objective of this thesis is to validate existing specification protocols, to monitor the chemical and rheological properties of Bolivian, Canadian and Costa Rican samples after being environmentally exposed for a year and compare these with samples subjected to standard and modified protocols that simulate long-term aging in the material. The project focuses on the chemical changes obtained in the material after exposure to rigorous oxidation processes and its relation with the deterioration in the ability to release the distresses at low temperatures causing premature cracking and loss of pavement integrity. Within the chemical analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy were employed to quantify the degree of oxidation and corroborate the presence of metals originating from recycled engine oil bottoms, respectively. Rheologically, the samples were analyzed in the dynamic shear rheometer, the regular bending beam rheometer (BBR), and the Extended BBR (EBBR), to obtain information related to fatigue and rutting resistance, rheological behavior at low, intermediate and high temperatures, and measure the stiffness at low temperatures after prolonged conditioning times. The ductile failure analysis was carried out using the double-edge-notched tension protocol which provides information about the critical crack tip opening displacement parameter, which is related to fatigue resistance. Finally, using modulated differential scanning calorimetry, the change of the glass transition with the different aging states and different cooling rates is studied.&#xd;
The appearance of unsaturation and increases in oxygen content in the environmentally aged samples lack correlation with the methods that simulate long term aging in laboratory making it impossible to validate the standard protocols. It is necessary to correlate the changes in the chemical structure of asphalt, the susceptibility to the oxidation of its molecules and the performance in service of the material. Besides, it was found that the modification of the binder with REOB and subjecting the asphalt to blowing processes to comply with the specification causes the asphalt to accelerate its oxidation and directly affect its performance in service. Modifications of the existing protocols generated great benefits when it comes to correlating and conditioning the samples more realistically to their state in service.</description>

   <description>This dissertation analyzes the construction of discursive communities amongst authors, editors, and readers of early modern prose fiction through language, material texts, and reader response. It analyzes Thomas More’s Utopia (1516), William Baldwin’s Beware the Cat (ca. 1553), and Philip Sidney’s Old and New Arcadia (ca. 1582-1586) as examples of significant early modern English prose fiction texts, and studies tensions between fiction and non-fiction, and theories of various communication media. The study considers the ways in which these texts invite (or discourage) open-ended interpretation from the reader, and foster dialogic interaction between the reader and the text. By studying Thomas More’s Utopia and its English translation, the dissertation begins with an exploration of how the physical book can serve as a site for ideal discussion between texts, authors, and readers through the form of annotation. With William Baldwin’s Beware the Cat, the study looks at the potential negative implications of free-ranging discussion and interpretation, as Baldwin paints the spread of misinformation through conversation, and provides solutions through the form of critical reading of print. Lastly, the dissertation studies Philip Sidney’s consideration of these humanist dialogic structures in the two versions of the Arcadia, arguing that though initially Sidney was attracted to the potential of prose fiction in fostering communal discursive explorations of political and philosophical considerations, he ultimately revised the Arcadia to decrease its dialogism to avoid a perceived riot of voices. My research contrasts these authors’ theoretical approaches to dialogism with the practical ways in which stationers and editors encouraged and discouraged dialogic reading through the print elements of these books. In its final analysis, the dissertation considers how readers responded to these various textual and material framings in their annotations and studies the readers’ dialogical engagements. Overall, the dissertation delivers a three-pronged approach,&#xd;
focusing on literary analysis, material culture, and reader response through annotation, and traces invited and performed debates amongst writers, producers, and readers of texts and the conflicted ways in which early modern prose fiction grappled with questions of truth, dissemination of information, and civic discussion.</description>

   <description>Message Passing Interface (MPI) is the de facto standard for communication in High Performance Computing (HPC). MPI Processes compute on their local data while extensively communicating with each other. Communication is therefore the major bottleneck for performance. This dissertation presents several proposals for improving the communication&#xd;
performance in MPI.&#xd;
&#xd;
Message matching is in the critical path of communications in MPI. Therefore, it has to be optimized given the scalability requirements of the HPC applications. We propose clustering-based message matching mechanisms as well as a partner/non-partner message queue design that consider the behavior of the applications to categorize the communicating&#xd;
peers into some groups, and assign dedicated queues to each group. The experimental evaluations show that the proposed approaches improve the queue search time and application runtime by up to 28x and 5x, respectively.&#xd;
&#xd;
We also propose a unified message matching mechanism that improves the message queue search time by distinguishing messages coming from point-to-point and collective communications. For collective elements, it dynamically profiles the impact of each collective call on message queues and uses this information to adapt the queue data structure. For&#xd;
point-to-point elements, it uses partner/non-partner queue design. The evaluation results show that we can improve the queue search time and application runtime by up to 80x and 5.5x, respectively.&#xd;
&#xd;
Furthermore, we consider the vectorization capabilities of used in new HPC systems many-core processors/coprocessors to improve the message matching performance. The evaluation results show that we can improve the queue search time and application runtime by up to 4.5x and 2.92x, respectively.&#xd;
&#xd;
Finally, we propose a collaborative communication mechanism based on common neighborhoods that might exist among groups of k processes. Such common neighborhoods are used to decrease the number of communication stages through message combining. We consider two design alternatives: topology-agnostic and topology-aware. The former ignores&#xd;
the physical topology of the system and the mapping of processes, whereas the latter takes them into account to further optimize the communication pattern. Our experimental results show that we can gain up to 8x and 5.2x improvement for various process topologies and a sparse matrix-matrix multiplication kernel, respectively.</description>

   <title>Taste and Ambition: Dutch Artists and Their Collections of Works on Paper</title>

   <description>This dissertation is a study of Dutch artists as collectors of prints and drawings in the seventeenth century. The presence of works on paper in artists’ workshops and their use as visual reference tools and objects for inspiration is generally accepted, but the individual character of these collections is worth deeper consideration. In order to explore the maintenance of and motivations for artists’ collections of works on paper, my thesis draws on the history of collecting as broadly understood, and the often distinct fields of the history of print collections and drawing collections.&#xd;
&#xd;
The collecting of graphic arts was integral to the artistic process. In this thesis, I consider the historical context of this practice through a series of case studies that reconstruct the collections of Christoffel van Sichem the Elder (1546–1624), Adriaen van Nieulandt (1587–1658), Rembrandt van Rijn (1606–1669), and Peter Lely (1618–1680). These four artists’ practices varied dramatically from producing books and woodcuts made for wide circulation to royal patronage meant for the few, but they are united by their cultivation of works on paper collections. Their collections can be reconstructed with the help of inventories, sale records, the objects they owned, and their respective oeuvres. This thesis explores the different shapes and uses Dutch artists’ collections took in the seventeenth century, and how their content reflects both the tastes of the individual artists and the impact of the collecting and study of graphic art on the work they produced. By considering artists who were active at different points throughout the century, I demonstrate the continuation of collecting practices and provide insights into how artists’ collections changed over time. In doing so, I reveal the diverse ways in which these collections were built and used. Further, I argue that artists’ collections are reflective not only of professional practice, but also of individual taste, interests, and ambitions.</description>

   <description>My thesis situates recent black visual arts practices in the context of exhibition practices and art history. I undertake a content analysis of 10 years of black visual arts reviews in FUSE Magazine and perform a close read of Tau Lewis’ 2017 exhibition cyphers, tissues, blizzards, exile. Through the FUSE content analysis, I am able to explore how an artist’s gender and race influence if and how black arts are discussed in a Canadian context. In my exploration of Lewis, I find that in the exhibition, she—a black woman artist—uses opacity as an aesthetic strategy to avoid presenting her work in a traditional, consumable way. In both of these chapters, the ongoing absented presence of blackness in Canada frames my approach to the case studies.</description>

   <title>The effect of initial arteriolar transmural pressure on vasodilation at the onset of muscle contraction</title>

   <subject>transmural pressure</subject>
   <description>Muscle contraction initiates a rapid vasodilation (widening) of small blood vessels in the skeletal muscle called arterioles, increasing muscle blood flow, which is greater when the contracting muscle is below, compared to above heart level. The mechanisms responsible for this effect of arm position on blood flow are unclear. Below the heart, blood pressure is larger in the arterial system due to gravity (called transmural pressure). Arterioles vasodilate in response to a reduction in transmural pressure, termed myogenic vasodilation. During muscle contraction, transmural pressure is reduced. This thesis tested the hypothesis that there is an increased myogenic vasodilation and corresponding blood flow after release of forearm contraction if precontraction transmural pressure was higher, as it is below vs. above heart level. To test this hypothesis, participants laid supine with their arm placed ~20cm either above (low transmural pressure condition; L) or below (high transmural pressure condition; H) heart level. During a 2s forearm contraction of a handheld force transducer, the arm position was either maintained or changed to the opposite limb position. This was repeated for all four possible starting-ending position combinations (L-L, H-L, L-H, H-H). Comparing different starting position effects by measuring the response in the same ending position ensured that only differences in active vasodilation could contribute to differences in post-contraction blood flow. As expected, postcontraction blood flow response was greater when measured below vs. above the heart. However, within the same ending position, starting arm position did not affect the magnitude of blood flow during either the first or peak cardiac cycle post-contraction (i.e. LL vs. HL, or LH vs. HH; P = 1.00). Similarly, there were no differences in dilation of the arterioles (calculated as; forearm vascular conductance = blood flow ÷ local forearm arterial blood pressure). These findings REFUTE the hypothesis that a greater transmural pressure environment upon contraction would result in increased vasodilation. Secondary analysis determined that the higher post-contraction blood flow below vs. above the heart could be explained by greater local arterial blood pressure and/or greater mechanical distension of arterioles due to greater transmural pressure below the heart.</description>

   <title>Evaluating the Surficial Geochemical Expressions in Soil, and Tree Cores Surrounding an LCT Pegmatite at Pakeagama Lake, Ontario</title>

   <description>The Pakeagama Lake Pegmatite is a complex type, petalite subtype Li-Cs-Ta (LCT)&#xd;
pegmatite, located in Northwestern Ontario, Canada, at the border of the Berens River and&#xd;
Sachigo subprovinces of the Archean Superior Province. In order to quantify the surface&#xd;
expression produced by the pegmatite, A and B horizon soils and tree cores of black spruce&#xd;
(Picea mariana) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana) were collected throughout the Pakeagama Lake&#xd;
property. The &lt; 63 μm fraction of the soils were separated, digested, and measured using two&#xd;
different methods, a near total digest using HCl, HF, HNO3, and H2O2 (3-acid digest) and a weak&#xd;
acid leach (WAL) technique designed to leach adsorbed ions.&#xd;
For A and B horizon soils that have undergone the 3-acid digest, there is a poor&#xd;
relationship between the chemistry of the underlying lithologies, and the chemistry of the soil,&#xd;
indicating that the soil is primarily sourced from till. Locations with greater concentrations of Li&#xd;
and Cs, two pathfinder elements associated with LCT pegmatites, are correlated with greater Fe&#xd;
and Mg concentrations and lower Na and K concentrations. This suggests that Li and Cs&#xd;
concentrations are also controlled by the dominate clay mineral and will be greatest in areas&#xd;
with the most illite or vermiculite. Concentrations of pathfinder elements (Li, Rb, Cs, Nb) in B&#xd;
horizon samples that underwent a WAL are not significantly elevated in samples taken adjacent&#xd;
to the pegmatite relative to background values.&#xd;
Both black spruce and jack pine were sampled during the survey, based on availability.&#xd;
At nine sites, both species were sampled for comparison. In all elements but Cs and Nb, the&#xd;
chemistry of the two species were poorly correlated, even when Ca normalized, so tree species&#xd;
were considered as independent media for analysis. No relationships between the chemistry of&#xd;
the underlying bedrock and either of the tree species is noted, and Li/Ca, Rb/Ca, and K/Ca do&#xd;
not exceed background values, even when taken directly adjacent to the pegmatite.</description>

   <description>All species have limits to their geographic distributions and many range limits are stable over centuries, indicating a failure to adapt to conditions beyond the range edge. This simple observation contradicts copious evidence for the rapid and near limitless response to selection in single traits across diverse species. Phenology, the timing of life history events like mating and offspring development, is likely a strong determinant of species’ ranges on gradients of season length. Species colonising shorter growing seasons (increasing elevation, latitude) require earlier reproduction and more rapid offspring development. Range margins could then occur where phenological adaptation cannot keep pace with declining season length, or where doing so results in negative population growth rates. Despite its importance, we have a poor understanding of how phenology varies and whether it is locally adaptive towards range limits. I tested how phenology contributes to range limitation in Rhinanthus minor L. (Orobanchaceae), an annual plant, with a distinct elevational distribution in the Rocky Mountains, Alberta, Canada. I quantified clines in phenology, morphology, and fitness for three generations in naturally occurring populations across elevation to the upper range limit. I then tested whether observed clines in phenology were the result of differentiation by source season length or plasticity with a replicated reciprocal transplant experiment over two generations. Next, I quantified how local adaptation and population genomic variation and differentiation support competing hypotheses of range limitation. Finally, I quantified the extent to which selection shapes phenological traits across the gradient. I found substantial natural clines in phenology that arise primarily from strong co-gradient plasticity. Minimal differentiation by source season length for phenology, and limited local adaptation, was reinforced by low genomic diversity, and genomic differentiation patterns that did not follow the gradient. Controlling for individual quality, selection analyses on natural and enhanced phenotypic variation confirmed consistent and strong selection for early reproduction regardless of elevation. Together, my results suggest that a lack of genetic variation for phenology constrains elevational range expansion in Rhinanthus minor. Combining these diverse avenues of research, I provide one of the most complete assessments yet of phenology as a range limiting trait.</description>

   <description>This thesis develops and tests a mass estimation system for macroalgae using optical computed tomography. The system consists of a table with a fixed camera and backlighting, which rotates around a container of macroalgae to collect images from various points.&#xd;
&#xd;
The images capture the translucency along various light paths through the container. From the translucency measurements, computed tomography techniques are used to reconstruct the optical density at points on the interior of the container. The mass of the macroalgae is determined as a function of the total optical density.&#xd;
&#xd;
The system was evaluated in several tests which controlled optical densities using "mock algae" consisting of a number of paper strips within the container.&#xd;
&#xd;
Experiments found a linear relationship between the total optical density and the number of mock algae strips. However, the relationship was inconsistent across experimental trials, and the reconstructed volumes were blurry and inaccurate. Despite several tests and analyses, these difficulties remain unexplained at this time.&#xd;
&#xd;
While the system has some potential due to the strong linearity within sets, the inconsistencies and inaccuracies must be resolved before it can be considered a viable tool for estimating the mass of real algae in an acrylic hollow cylinder.</description>

   <description>This dissertation is about migrant Francophone mothers’ experiences of mothering in Kingston, Ontario. It exposes how elements of these women’s life-stories, namely mothering, migration, and minority language, intersect with experiences of places to orient their subjectivities, their material conditions and practices, and their future possibilities in various ways. These intersections of life stories and places shape particular configurations of identification, affiliations, marginalization, power, and powerlessness, and define how patriarchal and heteronormative notions of gender assert themselves in each mother’s life. Kingston is a mid-sized city with a vast Anglophone majority where Francophones comprise less than 5% of the population. Francophone presence is largely invisible and marginal except in designated French-language institutions (e.g. French-language schools). Most Francophones in Kingston are economic migrants and their family members, including military families, from Québec, elsewhere in Canada or abroad. I conducted life-story interviews with thirty-two Francophone mothers living in Kingston in 2016. I also interviewed fifteen women holding key positions in French-language services organizations from 2016-18 while sitting on two planning and advocacy committees for French-language services.&#xd;
Significant planes of differences that emerge from Francophone mothers’ stories are whether they came to Kingston as primary or as secondary migrants, their degree of fluency in English, and their affiliation with the military. These differences define each mother’s social power and inclusion, and her experiences of the institution of motherhood and its gendered imperatives. These differences also shape the degree to which the dominant structures of place in Kingston constrain mothers’ everyday geographies. Mothers ‘make do’ and ‘make with’ relationships and structures non-conducive to their mothering and linguistic needs, and they experience places as passages that facilitate or hinder the continuity of their particular projects and forms of being. Francophone institutions, although they can foster smoother passages for some mothers, also reinforce gendered roles around feminized social reproduction and cultural labour. Francophone mothers’ experiences of difference in Kingston, as migrants, mothers, and Francophones, shape the articulations of gendered norms and stories of motherhood, care and social reproduction, and cultural transmission in their lives, and how these norms and stories channel their subjectivities and possibilities.</description>

   <description>Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit unique optical and electronic properties that make them highly appealing to the scientific community. Like graphene, they have strong in-plane bonds allowing for easy fabrication of complex single layer structures or molecular heterostructures. In particular, MoS2 is a TMD semiconductor that displays emerging photoluminescence (PL) as it transitions from an indirect band gap with a bulk thickness to a direct band gap at few- to mono-layer thickness. Its potential to be used in novel nanoelectronics and optical devices necessitate a better understanding of its excitonic properties. One issue is the reported variability of PL and electron mobility in MoS2;  we aimed to investigate influential factors affecting our 2D material and to optimize our devices. We also study the effects of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) encapsulation on MoS2 membranes as they are reported to mitigate surface roughness, increase PL, and protect against degradation. In the current work, we report our exfoliation and membrane transfer technique: a modified mask aligner and dry PDMS transfer for assembly of heterostructures. We developed simple optical methods to quantify layer number, which we correlated with Raman spectroscopy, Atomic force microscopy, and PL spectrum analysis. We then compared layer number, h-BN encapsulated samples, and exfoliated vs. grown MoS2 via chemical vapour deposition (CVD). We found red shifted PL peaks with increasing layer number and in CVD-grown MoS2, indicative of fewer defects in exfoliated devices. Also, PL intensity increased with decreasing layer number. We further discuss the lithographic process used to integrate monolayer samples into a bottom-gated field effect transistor, followed by their field effect mobility and resistance trends.</description>

   <description>The spread of Lyme disease continues to be a severe public health concern in Ontario, Canada due to rising temperatures. Several previous studies have modelled the extent and rate of risk increase at provincial and national scales using climate-based population modelling of the black-legged tick. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the applicability of this approach at a regional and health unit scale with high-resolution remotely sensed (RS) temperature data and GIS-based habitat suitability data. These data are input into a tick population model to calculate the basic reproductive number (R0), an indicator of reproductive success in a given environment. Monthly average RS land surface temperature data from 2008 to 2017 are used as model inputs to evaluate R0 values in eastern Ontario, and 8-day average RS land surface temperature data from 2016 to 2017 are used to evaluate R0 values in the Kingston, Frontenac, and Lennox &amp; Addington health unit region. It is found that there was an overall increase in R0 over eastern Ontario, up to a maximum rate of change of 0.28 ticks which survive to reproductive age per tick per year. The rate of change of R0 is not significantly impacted by elevation based upon local regression analysis, but is impacted by land cover type. Model outputs are validated using Lyme disease exposure information collected by Public Health Ontario. At the health unit scale, tick host density is varied according to habitat suitability to evaluate its impact relative to temperature. When host density is accounted for, urban areas become less suitable and forested areas become more suitable. This study provides increased insight into Lyme disease risk modelling at the regional and health unit scales, and the impact of tick host dynamics on habitat suitability at the health unit scale.</description>

   <description>Java is one of the most popular programming languages currently in use, and many modern applications and websites are programmed using Java. In this work, we examine how Java language features are actually used by programmers in a large set of open source Java applications. The analysis is carried out on a dataset of fifty-one open source Java applications, consisting of 64,557 files. We analyze our dataset using a parser written in the TXL source transformation language, which extracts and counts the use of both syntactic features and public Java library classes and interfaces in Java applications. Our study is designed to assist language designers in understanding how to evolve Java by concentrating on improving the most frequently used features, removing the most rarely used features, and identifying opportunities to improve Java public libraries to better serve programmers. As a side effect, our results can also help to improve language artifacts such as grammar and documentation.</description>

   <description>Empathy and caring are the foundations upon which the fundamentals and principles of nursing practice are grounded, and help to delicately balance scientific knowledge and humanistic behaviours. Three nursing organizations in Canada: 1) the Canadian Nurses Association (CNA), 2) College of Nurses of Ontario (CNO), and 3) Registered Nurses Association of Ontario (RNAO), through a code of ethics, professional practice standards, and best practice guidelines, advocate for the delivery of safe, ethical and empathetic nursing care. Caring relationships in nursing, based on trust, respect, professional intimacy, and evidence contribute to therapeutic nurse-patient relationships. &#xd;
	Unfortunately, many nursing students are unable to develop therapeutic relationships based upon their internal working models (IWM) formed in childhood. Depending on the consistency of care received in childhood especially during times of stress a relatively stable pattern of low attachment avoidance and low attachment anxiety develops. Whereas, inconsistent care can lead to high attachment avoidance where individuals present as uncaring, emotionally distant, and self-reliant, while individuals with high attachment anxiety fear rejection, abandonment, and worry others will be unavailable or unresponsive to them.  The purpose of this study was the testing of a theoretical model linking attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety to empathy, the mediator variable, and caring. &#xd;
	This cross-sectional survey of 192 baccalaureate nursing students in a collaborative nursing program in Ontario were sampled and a theoretical model was tested using latent variable structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques. The final analysis revealed a relatively good fit of the data to the hypothesized model (X2 =129.30; p &lt;.01; df = 57; X2/df = 2.26), high GFI (.92), high TLI (.92), high CFI (.94), and an acceptable RMSEA (.07).  Higher caring was significantly correlated with empathy while attachment avoidance was negatively correlated with empathy. The model demonstrated there was no direct effect between attachment avoidance and caring while empathy fully mediated the relationship between these constructs. These findings suggest new evidence in understanding attachment avoidance indirectly affects nursing students’ caring abilities through empathy. From these results, nurse educators’ empathy and caring toward nursing students may have an impact on students’ IWM, empathy, caring and therapeutic relationships.</description>

   <description>Cognitive remediation is an efficacious treatment for schizophrenia that focuses on enhancing neurocognitive abilities and improving community functioning. However, there is currently no gold-standard cognitive remediation therapy and different approaches have produced varying results on cognitive and functional outcomes. One of the major barriers preventing cognitive remediation from being recommended in treatment guidelines has been limited generalization of cognitive improvement to functional improvement. Although results have been inconsistent, executive functioning may be more closely related to community functioning than other domains of neurocognition. The objective of the current dissertation was to examine the efficacy of cognitive training that specifically targets executive functioning for individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. In Chapter 2 data are presented from a randomized, double blind trial examining a brief two-week executive functioning intervention compared to a sham training condition. Compared to sham training, executive training significantly improved EEG alpha and theta band synchronization during working memory tasks, and neuropsychological measures of working memory and executive functioning. In Chapter 3 data are presented from a randomized, double-blind trial examining brief executive function training compared to training of perceptual abilities on measures of neurophysiology, neurocognition, and functioning. Perceptual training improved the EEG mismatch negativity more than executive training immediately post-treatment however, the effect did not persist 12-weeks post-treatment. At 12-week follow-up, executive training significantly improved EEG theta power, neurocognition, functional competence, and case manager rated community functioning to a greater extent than perceptual training. Executive training may be a more efficient cognitive enhancing treatment than other cognitive remediation techniques, and treatment effects generalize to community functioning better than alternative cognitive training approaches.</description>

   <description>This Ph.D. is an ethnographic-activist-based project. It first examines the genealogy of popular nationalist-statist and religious enforcements of postcolonial cisheteronormativity in Egypt through the examination of two case studies, the Cairo 52 case in 2001 and the transgendered case of Sally Abd Allah in 1982. It then presents my fieldwork, which documents my ethnographic narrators’ resistance to these narratives. Specifically, my fieldwork investigates the neocolonial/neoimperial conditions that inform the circulatory geopolitical relationship between Islam and queerness in non-Western societies such as franchise-colonial Egypt and settler-colonial U.S./Canada, in an age where sexual and gender diversity is a hallmark of neoliberal ‘secular’ modernity, whose advent historically exposed Arabs, North Africans, and Muslims, if not all non-Europeans, to a plethora of false competing dualisms, such as secular/religious and heterogeneity/homogeneity, as well as discourses such as homonationalism (al-qawmiyyat al-mīthlīyat) and pinkwashing (al-ghaseel al-banafsajiy). My fieldwork participants offer decolonial, gender-based, readings and formulations of queerness through their diverse and complex experiences, which evade the apparent tidiness of European feminist and narrow LGBTIQA categories that characterizes most Western/non-Western political queer scholarship. While the spiritual initiatives of diasporic queer Muslims clarifies the urgent need for a radical, decolonial, reinterpretation of Islam, the revolutionary participation of queer Egyptians in the so-called ‘Arab Spring/Islamist Winter’ offers crucial challenges to both discourses on gender/sexuality in the Middle East and academic and activist literatures on radical and revolutionary social action. In this dissertation, queer Egyptians, and queer Muslims in particular, appear as single theorists of radical political activity, not the co-opted and duped, colonized pawns of the ‘Gay Empire’. This exploration of queer interventions in revolutionary Egypt will force&#xd;
iii&#xd;
radical social theorists to consider postcolonial/decolonial queer politics as a primary basis for determining the shape and course of future revolutionary theory and praxis in this current xenophobic and Islamophobic geopolitical moment. Utilizing intersectional/assemblage based theories, I argue that strictly adopting sexual discourses, in the absence of accounting for colonialism/imperialism as well as engaging postcolonial, critical race and feminist discourses, is insufficient to narratively/analytically understand the dynamic nature of Arab and Muslim gender and sexualities in these Islamophobic conditions.</description>

   <description>This thesis proposes strategies to improve the crystallinity and mechanical properties of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and investigates the effects of these modifications on hydrolytic degradation. The effect of long-chain branching (LCB) on the hydrolytic degradation at 60°C was monitored through the mass loss, molar mass distributions, and thermal properties of degraded specimens. A three-week induction period prior to the onset of mass loss coupled with an immediate loss in molar mass of over 80% in the same timeframe pointed to a bulk erosion mechanism. The highest loss in molar mass was observed in the z-average molar mass (Mz) of LCB PLA, exceeding 90% in the first three-weeks, and was attributed to the cleavage of the LCB segments from the polymer chain. Degradation-induced crystallinity resulted from the enhanced chain mobility at the experimental conditions, owing to the combined influence of annealing and the plasticizing effect of water. Although the hydrolysis profile differed between the linear and branched PLAs, branching did not affect negatively the extent of degradation over a 12-week period.&#xd;
Increases in the crystallinity of PLA from 5% to 20% were achieved through reactive extrusion and the addition of biofiller (BF), a novel type of cross-linked PLA-based nucleating agent. The crystallinity of the nucleated formulations was further increased to over 50% by annealing at temperatures between 80 and 120C. The BF additive was particularly effective in improving the crystallinity due to its PLA-based nature, which provided good compatibility with the matrix material. Owing to the improved crystallinities, the annealed materials demonstrated over 30% increases in flexural moduli compared to the neat material, while impact strength was maintained. Annealing of the modified PLA also resulted in 10°C increases in the glass transition temperatures followed by improvements in the heat deflection temperature (HDT) by as much as 7°C. An annealing temperature of 100C was selected as optimum, due to evidence of thermal degradation taking place above this temperature. When subjected to hydrolysis over a 12-week period, the nucleated and annealed PLA degraded to the same extent as the untreated PLA, with over 30% loss in mass and 90% loss in molar mass.</description>

   <description>Worldwide research on deafblindness is sparse, particularly in low and middle-income countries such as India. Persons with deafblindness often experience participation barriers. Yet little is known about their lived experience of participation, influencing factors, and ways to enhance it. To address this evidence gap, this phased study aimed to synthesize evidence on the participation experiences of persons with deafblindness (Phase 1); to understand what participation means to persons with deafblindness in India (Phase 2); and to describe the contextual factors that influence the participation of persons with deafblindness from the perspectives of those with deafblindness and their service providers (Phase 3). To fulfill the aims, I conducted scoping review in Phase 1, and qualitative interviews with 16 persons with deafblindness and two focus group discussions with 16 professionals in Phases 2 and 3. Interviews and group discussions were guided by the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. The understanding of participation experiences and influencing contextual factors suggest ways to enhance the participation of persons with deafblindness. Findings indicate participation as a dynamic, individualized construct that is not just an end outcome. Rather, it is a means to achieve other goals important to the participants such as gaining respect, autonomy, independence, support and relationships, to fulfil aspirations and responsibilities, and to feel included and recognized in society. Life domains that persons with deafblindness value for participation were access to information, communication, mobility, relationships, education and productivity, and recreation and leisure. Resources, such as deafblind-specific rehabilitation services, alternative communication modes, and technology/aids (e.g., hearing aids, cochlear implants, refreshable braille displays, and magnifiers) were helpful in improving access to information, communication and social interactions, and thus important for enhancing participation. Results suggest that rehabilitation services and policies must be designed to focus on life domains that persons with deafblindness value. It is also important to address environmental barriers such as lack of awareness about deafblindness among the public, negative societal attitudes, and limited resources to support the participation of those with deafblindness.</description>

   <title>INTEGRATING VISUAL ART AND LANGUAGE, SOCIAL SCIENCE AND SCIENCE:  UNIT PLANS FOR A TEACHING ARTIST</title>
   <creator>Ravishankar, Varshiini</creator>
   <subject>Teaching artist, art partnership, integrating  visual art with social science, language, and science</subject>
   <description>The broad purpose of the project was to explore what an arts partnership could look like. An arts partnership generally involves an artist—or “teaching artist”—from the community spending time in a classroom, working with the teacher and students on art projects. I begin the project with a review of literature that describes what an arts partnership is, the benefits they provide, different ways they are structured, some of the issues or challenges with arts partnerships, and who supports arts partnerships in Ontario. The second part of the project presents curriculum designed for a teaching artist to use in schools with students in grades six to eight. I begin the section by describing the guiding principles I used to design the teaching artist programs. I then provide detailed lesson plans. Program 1 (8 weeks) integrates visual art with language. Program 2 (4 weeks) integrates visual art with social studies (geography). Program 3 (4 weeks) integrates visual art with science. Within the programs I intentionally created resources for the teaching artist to use that emphasize visual and oral communication instead of relying only on written communication. For example, I created a number Power Point presentations to visually enhance communication of information and ideas and to show students examples of art work. I also created videos to demonstrate art-making techniques. Further, I created exemplars of all the assignments to show students the kinds of things they are expected to produce.</description>

   <description>Augmented reality has been used in neurosurgery to aid in the visualization of lesions, though it has not been widely adopted for simulation-based neurosurgical training. This work aims to determine if augmented reality can improve identification of drill location and drill angle for neurosurgical procedures and to define objective metrics for assessing trainee performance.&#xd;
&#xd;
An augmented reality visualization system was developed using the Microsoft HoloLens. Trainee performance metrics were defined and validated intra-operatively in fifteen neurosurgical cases by attending neurosurgeons and trainees. Trainee performance in localization of drill location and angle tasks was assessed in a simulated training with augmented reality visualization and compared with two other visualization methods.&#xd;
&#xd;
The proposed metrics allowed us to significantly differentiate levels of competence between attending neurosurgeons and trainees in identification of drill location with (p = 0.011) and without (p = 0.001) the HoloLens and drill angle with (p = 0.032) the HoloLens. Augmented reality visualization significantly improved trainee performance in localization of drill location (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.008) and angle (p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.001) in comparison to two other visualization methods. Trainees rated augmented reality visualization equally or more helpful compared to the two other visualization methods.&#xd;
&#xd;
Trainee performance assessment with augmented reality visualization and the proposed performance metrics stands to add practical value to neurosurgical training curricula. This work represents a necessary step in curriculum development in neurosurgical training for the task of drill location and angle localization in a variety of neurosurgical procedures.</description>

   <description>Purpose: Breast-conserving therapy can result in significant breast deformity in up to 40 percent of patients. Breast reconstruction to correct these deformities is considered an integral part of breast cancer care. Monitoring the differences in breast volume and visualizing shape differences during the reconstruction process could help optimize surgical planning and efficiency of procedures, such as autologous fat grafting. The purpose of this thesis was to develop and validate a clinical workflow and accompanying software to compute breast volume differences and visualize shape differences in post-breast-conserving therapy patients. &#xd;
Methods: A workflow to efficiently capture a three-dimensional surface scan of a patient’s torso during a clinical visit was designed. Custom software was developed to compute differences in breast volume and visualize breast shape differences using the three-dimensional surface scans. The workflow and accompanying software were validated in a study conducted with fourteen patients. Each patient was scanned five times to assess the reproducibility of the computation of breast volume differences across all the scans. The breast shape visualizations were also computed and then validated by the breast reconstruction surgeon. &#xd;
Results: The average coefficient of variance for the same breast volume differences was 1.49%. The average normalized standard deviation for the left-right breast volume differences was 1.17%.  The breast shape visualizations qualitatively reflected the expected dissimilarities in breast shape for all patients. &#xd;
Conclusion: A workflow and software to compute the breast volume differences and visualize the shape dissimilarities of post-breast-conserving therapy patients were created. The reproducibility of our results suggests the methods are ready to be used in the clinical setting to assist in surgical planning of fat grafting for reconstruction of breast deformities.</description>

   <description>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been the number one cause of death in the world for several decades and will continue to worsen as a global epidemic. The underlying cause of CVD is atherosclerosis: most myocardial infarctions are caused by atherosclerotic plaque build-up in the coronary arteries, also known as coronary artery disease (CAD). Even though the exact mechanism is unknown, hemodynamic disturbance is a potential precursor for atherosclerotic development. The natriuretic peptide system, especially B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), plays an important role in hemodynamic regulation. Genetic variants, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of the BNP gene affect its expression and correlate with increased circulating BNP levels. The goal of this thesis research is to determine if SNPs of the natriuretic peptide system contributes to atherosclerotic development, and if these genetic variants can help predict CVD.&#xd;
We recruited 513 patients from Kingston General Hospital, who were undergoing coronary angiography, the clinical standard for detecting CAD. Blood sample was collected from each patient for genetic analysis. BNP gene SNP, rs198389, was significantly associated with severe CAD in women but not in men. It suggests that the mechanism of atherosclerosis development may differ between the sexes. &#xd;
In the second portion of the thesis, we investigated the role of genetic mutation in atherosclerosis in the carotid arteries, major arteries in the neck. Ultrasound was used to reveal and quantify carotid plaques, which correlated with the severity of plaques in coronary arteries. BNP genetic variant, rs198389, was associated with the extend of atherosclerosis in the carotid artery.&#xd;
In the final part of the thesis, we evaluated major adverse cardiovascular events such as heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular death. The SNP rs198389 was found to be a significant predictor for early cardiovascular events, as well as recurrent events.&#xd;
In summary, this thesis demonstrates that the BNP genetic variant rs198389 may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis in different arterial beds across the body, and it has the potential to be an important tool to predict adverse cardiovascular events.</description>

   <description>Software development continues to demand advanced features which current programming languages do not offer.  Language developers constantly evolve their languages to simplify common tasks, make the language more natural to use, and extend its features in response to the demands of software development. Language features are often not utilized efficiently in software development due to various obstacles.  Existing software source code provides vital information on programming language use and the frequency with which the developers utilize language features. This has encouraged many researchers to examine the use of language features.&#xd;
&#xd;
TXL is a domain-specific language used in research focused on software analysis. TXL has proven to be an excellent option for constructing language parsers with which researchers can efficiently extract information on language use.  Language use vectors, which encode language use data, can be a crucial feature in language use studies and software analysis, because they precisely represent language use statistics in compact mathematical form.  Language use vectors can be derived directly from the grammar of the target programming language, which gives them an edge over other metrics employed in language use studies.  In all the prior studies, researchers have manually constructed TXL feature analyzers for each target language, a process that significantly delays analysis projects.&#xd;
&#xd;
This thesis explores the possibility of automating the construction of TXL language use extractors from a given language grammar.  In this way, language feature analyzers for new programming lanuguages can be rapidly and accurately built with little or no manual effort.  We present an automated process for generating TXL-based extractors directly from programming language grammars, and demonstrate its use in analyzing language use in large corpora of three programming languages, Java, Ruby and C.</description>

   <description>Human thriving is often counterposed to survival and perceived as the ultimate achievable goal on a spectrum of human development and positive functioning. However, few researchers have attempted to directly tackle thriving within the educational context. Furthermore, student thriving has been largely overlooked within the literature on Kindergarten and early childhood education. Given that children’s early experiences lay the foundation for lifelong learning, development, health, and well-being, the importance of supporting children to thrive within the early years of life and school should not be overlooked.&#xd;
The purpose of this qualitative study was to understand how student thriving is conceptualized and can be supported within the context of the Ontario Kindergarten classroom from the perspective of three key stakeholders (students, educators, and parents). Through this understanding, a theory grounded in the data was developed. Six Kindergarten students, three educators (early childhood educator, Kindergarten teacher, and head administrator), and seven parents provided a rich understanding of Kindergarten student thriving and its supports. Although the language used to convey these ideas differed among the stakeholder groups, numerous commonalities and consistencies were observed across the three perspectives. These consistent themes included: positive relationships; in[ter]dependence; value of play; holistic development; and individualized experiences and diverse trajectories of thriving. &#xd;
Findings from this study illustrate that thriving is a complex and multi-dimensional construct, and that supporting student thriving in the Kindergarten classroom requires a multi-faceted, integrated approach. Because no prior research has endeavoured to explore thriving within this context, and early childhood more generally, this research provides an essential starting point from which to better understand human thriving at this early stage of life and across the lifespan. Furthermore, the findings from this study offer insight into the indicators and supports of student thriving within the Kindergarten classroom, which have implications for both research and practice.</description>

   <title>Painting a Portrait of Organizational Evaluation Capacity in the Canadian Art Museum sector</title>

   <description>Not only is research on program evaluation practice and capacity in art museums largely absent, but also the actual dimensions of evaluation capacity as they could be observed in these unique professional settings have heretofore neither been conceptualized or defined based on empirical data. This study sought to (a) develop a framework that conceptualized what evaluation capacity might look like in art museums and (b) examine how such capacity manifested itself across the framework’s various dimensions both sector-wide and in those Canadian art museums that were most active in conducting a wide range of research and evaluation studies. A two-phase multiple method qualitative research design was used to address the purposes of this research. Phase One involved conducting an interview study to establish an initial knowledge base on Canadian art museum educators’ program evaluation practices and capacities and test the degree to which the initial conceptual framework that was developed to guide this study could be considered an accurate and complete description of evaluation capacity in the Canadian art museum context. Phase Two involved conducting qualitative case studies of two art museums that, based on the interview findings, were identified as operating at the highest level of capacity for evaluation in the country. The study provided the evidence necessary to finalize the initial conceptual framework and concluded that evaluation capacity in Canadian art museums could be described through six central sub-divided dimensions. The study results likewise both painted a portrait of moderate capacity for evaluation across the sector (with smaller pockets of high capacity) and shed empirical light on the phenomenon of developed capacity in selected Canadian art museums. In, demarcating the dimensions that comprise evaluation capacity in art museums, this research makes a significant theoretical contribution to the evaluation literature. Several key recommendations that outline what could be done to strengthen the evaluation capacity of art museums in Canada, meanwhile, represent the main practical implication of this study. These recommendations are likely to be useful not only to the growing number of art museums seeking to integrate evaluation into their organizational cultures but also to several other sectors and organizational types.</description>

   <title>Traces of (Un-) Sustainability: Towards a Materially Engaged Ecology of Mind</title>

   <description>Discussions of sustainability are usually framed within a dominant Cartesian dualistic paradigm as something that requires material changes in the world, for example, a new technological invention, or alternatively, new ideas guiding human behaviours. Yet many environmental philosophers have long recognized that this same Cartesian inheritance also underlies the ecological problems that beset us. The need to recognize the cultural specificity and delusional nature of this divide was, for example, the core argument of Bateson’s Steps to an Ecology of Mind. Here the claim is that our thoughts are themselves always part of, and party to, the material ecologies of the world we inhabit. This thesis draws on Bateson’s insights, together with approaches derived from phenomenology, theories of materially extended mind (Clarke) and notions of ‘mediated action’ in sociocultural analysis (Wertsch) and social psychology, to offer an alternative model of the conditions of (un)sustainability. In particular, it argues for the novel employment of what has come to be known (following Malafouris) as Material Engagement Theory (MET). As the term suggests, MET, originally developed in archaeological accounts of the emergence of human minds through tool use, emphasizes that thought is not separable from its material context and the tools deployed in its operations. Thought and agency are materially distributed. Through detailed examples, such as the mown lawn, this approach is also shown to apply to our current environmental predicament, where the material qualities of environments co-constitute the collective perceptual, emotional, and cognitive processes we employ to bring forth an entire world as an unsustainable artifact. Important implications of this approach for enacting sustainability are discussed.</description>

   <description>The endothelium is a single cell layer that plays a critical role in determining the health and function of blood vessels. Endothelial function is shaped by shear stress, the frictional force exerted by the speed of blood flow and the thickness (viscosity) of the blood. Exposure to shear stress that reverses direction back-and-forth impairs endothelial function in young men. Whether women are equally susceptible to this perturbation and the isolated impact of a low level of shear stress with and without reversal of shear had not been investigated. Hypoxia, the low levels of oxygen that are experienced at high-altitude, has been shown to influence flow reversal and impair endothelial function. However, no previous study had accounted for the changes in blood thickness, and hence shear stress that occur at high-altitude. This may be especially important in the context of excessive erythrocytosis, a high-altitude disease characterized by exceptionally thick blood and increased cardiovascular risk. This thesis examined 1) whether there are sex differences in the impact of exposure to low and reversing shear stress on endothelial function, 2) whether isolated low shear stress impairs endothelial function, 3) the impact of reversing shear stress on endothelial function in short-term exposure to low levels of oxygen and after trekking to 5050m in the Himalayas, and 4) the role of high levels of blood viscosity on endothelial function in high-altitude natives in Cerro de Pasco, Peru (4330m) with excessive erythrocytosis. We identified that 1) premenopausal women have some protection against reductions in endothelial function after being exposed to reversing shear stress, 2) isolated low shear stress impaired endothelial function, 3) short-term exposure to low levels of oxygen and sustained high-altitude exposure reduced endothelial function, while superimposing reversing shear stress had no effect, and 4) high levels of hemoglobin and blood viscosity contributed to lower endothelial function in Andean high-altitude natives with excessive erythrocytosis. Altogether, this dissertation advances our understanding of how the components of shear stress (the pattern, magnitude, and blood viscosity) impact endothelial function in humans under normoxic (normal levels of oxygen) and hypoxic (low levels of oxygen, such as high-altitude) conditions.</description>

   <description>Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensing is a technique that is increasingly being used to investigate interactions between biomolecules due to its ability to be monitored in real-time and the lack of labelling needed. Traditionally, SPR biosensor chips utilized thiol-based self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) as linking layers on a gold surface, however, the use of thiols has been limited due to their tendency to oxidize in ambient conditions. Thus, a new and emerging class of surface modification using N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) as surface ligands is being explored as an alternative to thiol-based SAMs for biosensing surfaces. In this thesis, chemical modification of SPR biosensing surfaces using NHCs as a SAM on gold is examined.&#xd;
The first part of this thesis focuses on developing an NHC SPR biosensing chip comparable to the most commonly used biosensor, the Biacore general-purpose carboxymethylated (CM) 5 chip. Using an interaction involving bovine serum albumin (BSA) and anti-BSA antibody, the capabilities of the homemade NHC-based sensor chip were examined using a 50 cycle analysis of antibody binding to the BSA surface. A response was observed for all binding interactions; however, the reproducibility of the interactions was inadequate due to non-specific binding. This limited the use of the NHC sensor chip in applications involving kinetic studies.&#xd;
The second part of my thesis describes the creation of a more stable NHC sensing surface using a high-affinity capture approach, circumventing non-specific binding. Protein A was immobilized as the surface ligand and immunoglobin G (IgG) was used as the analyte. Highly reproducible interactions over 80 cycles involving little to no deterioration of the response were observed. This facilitated the study of kinetic analysis of the protein A – IgG system; however, due to mass transfer limitations (MTL), the rate constants derived were inaccurate.&#xd;
Finally, NHC-based sensors were used in the creation of a lipid bilayer surface. This bilayer surface demonstrated instability as observed from its low binding ability and ease of being removed from the sensor surface.</description>

   <description>This thesis traces the way hunger was transformed into a medical problem and humanitarian food relief mutated into medical treatment from the Second World War until contemporary times. I chart how the medicalization of hunger redefined the way hunger was managed, identifying the marked features of the medicalization of hunger and looking especially to the nutritional solutions employed in emergency contexts. Medical scrutiny into the starving body, the proliferation of medical categories, the design of specific and differentiated protocols of management, the integration of hunger with the care of other concurrent or aggravated medical conditions, and the view of food as medicine emerged in an expanded form starting with World War II and continue to endure today. A predominant medical lens urged the implementation of interventions guided by medical expertise and subjected to medical supervision, reconceptualizing hunger relief as treatment. Another focus of this thesis is upon the global&#xd;
networks of knowledge that underlie the medicalization of hunger. If professionals with a medical experience assumed prominence and continue to retain influence in nutrition, experts from all corners of the world with a range of backgrounds constitute the global assemblage of hunger research and responses. Finally, I underscore the increasing emphasis on children in scientific hunger studies and humanitarian nutrition programs. &#xd;
With the scientific community coalescing around the view of hunger as disease, humanitarian responses to hunger became increasingly technocratic, favoring efficient and largescale&#xd;
technically-engineered solutions devised with expert knowledge. I show the persistent allure&#xd;
of simple, fast-acting concoctions of high-yielding medical and nutritional efficacy in humanitarian nutrition. The predominance of technically-engineered solutions in humanitarian nutrition speaks both to an established reliance on medico-scientific knowledge and the prioritization of expedient responses in the face of the need for immediate action. Employing a historical lens, I challenge straightforward accounts anchored in medico-scientific knowledge that exalt the novelty and adequacy of technically-engineered solutions to hunger. I grapple with the implications of a predominant medical frame to argue that managing hunger in emergency contexts should not be incompatible with politically-mindful, people-centered approaches integrated in local realities.</description>
